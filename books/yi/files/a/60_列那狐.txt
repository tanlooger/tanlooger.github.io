列那狐


译序


中世纪的欧洲，出了一部伟大的禽兽史诗，这就是《列那狐》（Reynard the Fox）。我读了这部书，觉得异常的可爱，故费了一二月的工夫把它介绍给读者。

关于《列那狐》，学者间的争论颇不少，第一是它的作者问题，第二是它的产生地的问题。关于它的作者，有的主张是由民间传说发展而成的，有的主张是“僧侣诗人”们的创作。关于它的产地，有的主张是德国，有的主张是法国。但不管那许多纷纭莫决的主张，我们现在却有了一种概念：这部《列那狐》原有一个民间传说的来源，这来源是在法国。然在十世纪与十一世纪时，经了“僧侣诗人”与法国“宫廷诗人”的润饰，加上了时代的色彩与讽刺的意味。当时宫廷诗人大约必以此诗与那些古代史诗、骑士传奇，同样地读诵于听者之前，以娱悦他们。到了十二世纪时，有了一种德文本，又有了拉丁文本，变异的同源作品有数种，后来又有了散文本。到了十八世纪之末，大诗人歌德又著了Rainecke Fuchs，在文辞方面，是加上了不少的美漆，然它的原来的朴质可爱的风趣，却丧失了一些。

《列那狐》最可爱最特异的一点，便是善于描写禽兽的行动及性格，使之如真的一般，还有它引进了许多古代的寓言，如熊被骗，被紧夹在树缝中；狐低头看马蹄，被马所踢等，而能够自由地运用，使之十分的生动，也是极可使我们赞美的。

在歌德所述的Rainecke Fuchs里，会附有大画家Kaulbach所绘插图三十余幅，极为有趣。评论者都谓这给本书以新的生命。现在把它们转插于本书中。

为取便于中国的儿童计，此书采用“重述”法，但所删节的地方并不多见。另一英译本，删节了三分之二，只叙到第十四节为止。原书的结局是列那狐终于得释，这个英译本，却不欲使狡者得志，竟把它的结果改作：列那被处死刑，大快人心了！编译儿童书而处处要顾全“道德”，是要失掉许多文学的趣味的。

“列那狐在家中。”



“全体禽兽的高贵的王——狮子。”





1


在五旬节的前后，树林中大概都是美丽而且可爱的，树木覆被着叶与花，地上铺着绿草与有香气的花朵，禽鸟们和谐地唱着悦耳的歌；在这个时候，全体禽兽的高贵的王——狮子，要在这次宴会的几个圣日里，坐朝办理国政。他要把这件事叫他国境之内全都知道，又出了告示说，每个禽兽都必须到这里来——于是所有大的小的禽兽都到了宫廷里来，只有列那狐不来，他自己知道他有许多罪恶，得罪过许多到这里来的禽兽，因此，他便不敢到来了。当禽兽之王坐朝，所有禽兽都集合在那里时，只听见许多禽兽在苦苦地控告着列那狐。





2


依赛格林（Esegrim）狼同他的亲族与朋友们到来，站在国王面前，说道：“高贵有力的王，我的主，我恳求你，以你的威力、正直与仁慈，你要对于列那狐所给予我及我的妻子的种种侵害及无理的胡闹，加以怜惘。他不管我妻子的不愿，强行侵入我的屋里。我的儿子们睡在那里，他撒尿在他们头上，因此他们从此成了瞎眼。亲爱的王，这件事，现在到你宫廷这里来的禽兽，有许多都是知道的。他还有许多侵害的事，我也不便细说，现在只好不提。但他对于我妻的羞辱，这是我万不能不报仇的，必须叫他给我以赔偿。”





3


狼说完了话，小猎狗考托士（Courtoys）又立起来向国王控诉说，怎样的在寒冷的冬天，霜雪满地，他为严冬所苦，什么食物都没有了，只存一个布丁，而列那狐却把这个布丁从他那里偷走了。

他说了这些话，特保（Tybert）猫愤怒地跳到他们中间，说道：“国王，吾主。我在这里听见列那狐被人苛刻地控告，没有别人，只有他自己，才能洗清他。但考托士在这里控告的，却是许多年前的事——那个布丁是我的，而我却不控告，因为我在夜间从一个磨坊里把它得来。磨坊主人躲在那里睡着了。如果考托士有什么份，那也是由我那里得来的。”

于是潘莎海狸说道：“你想一想看，特保，列那被人控告是不应该的么？他简直是一个谋杀者，一个海盗，一个贼，他不爱任何一个人，就是这里我们的王，我们的主，他也不爱。他只要能取得一只肥鸡的腿，即便失去善德与名誉也愿意。我要告诉你，我昨天看见他对于克瓦Cuwart兔所做的事，克瓦现在是站在这里，受着国王的和平而安全的保护。列那答应克瓦说，他要教克瓦他的‘克里独’（Credo），使他成一个好牧师。他叫他去坐他的两腿之中，唱着而且高声叫道：‘克里独，克里独！’我刚由那里经过，听见这个歌声。后来我走近了，却看见这位列那先生已放下他方才的教读与教歌的事而又在演他的旧戏了。因为，他这时已把克瓦的咽喉捉住，如果我这时不来，他已把克瓦的生命取去了。你们在这里还可以看出克瓦兔的新创痕。我的主，我的王，如果你对于这事没有刑罚，让那个破坏你的和平者安安静静地走掉，你便要没有权力审判你的部下，即你的子孙们在许多年之后也要受骂的。”

“的确如此，潘莎。”依赛格林说道，“你说的不错。实行正义与公理，是正当的，如此，弱者才能生存于和平之中。”

于是猎猪格令巴（Grymbart）出来说话了，他是列那的姊姊的儿子，说话时带着怒气。

“依赛格林勋爵，你的话是不对的。俗谚有之，‘一个仇敌的口中，说不出好话来。’你说的都是谎话，你责备我舅父列那的话又是对的么？我可以说，你不敢确定地说，你们二人中，列那侵害你比你侵害他更甚些，应该用绳把头颈挂在树上，如一个贼一样。但是他如果像你一样现在也在这宫廷上，在国王身边，他心里要不要想道，你所做的事已够叫你去向他谢罪。——你曾许多次用你的凶残尖利的牙齿咬我的舅父，至于究竟多少次，我简直算也算不清楚了。但我可以说出我所熟知的几件事：你不记得你怎样地处置他从车上抛下来的比目鱼，当你远远地跟在车后面，自己独自吃掉了好的比目鱼，只剩下鱼骨或你自己所不吃的骨头给他么？同这一样，你对于肥猪肋肉也不肯给他，这猪肋肉气味非常好，你独自吃在嘴里了，当我舅父向你要他的一份时，你却侮蔑地答他道：‘列那，好孩子，我很高兴把你的一份给你。’——但我的舅父却什么也没有得到——实则这块猪肋肉乃是他冒大险而得来的，因为人来了，把他抛到一个袋中，他好容易才得逃命出来。如此同样的事，列那曾从依赛格林那里受到许多次。唉，诸位先生，你们想想，这是对的么？然而还有呢。他控告我舅父列那怎样的侵害他，因为侮辱到他的妻子。我舅父确曾躺在她身边，但那是七年之前的事了——那时他还没有娶她呢，如果列那为了恋爱与敬礼对她表示他的意志，那有什么要紧？她不久是被恕了。所以依赛格林如果聪明些，便没有控告的权利。他要相信他自己没有权利如此的诬谤他的妻子。现在还要对于兔子克瓦的事说明一下。我想这事是一种猜想。如果他读书时，功课读得不对，他的先生列那还不应该打他么？如果不打学生们，不叱责他们的懒惰，他们要永不肯用功的。再说考托士控告说他很苦地在冬天得到一块布丁，在这时候，食物正是很不易找寻。但他最好不要开口控诉，因为他的布丁是偷来的。古谚说道，‘悖得者亦悖失’，是应该的。如果列那从一个贼那里取去所偷的东西，谁会去责备他？这是正理。他懂得法律，能够明白正义。我的舅父是一个和爱真实的人，他不能忍受虚伪的事。他做事都与他的牧师讨论。他永不曾害过什么人，因为他一天不过吃一顿，他过着隐士的生活，他有一年多不曾吃肉了。我昨天听见从他那里来的几个人说，他已经离开他的马里卜台（Maleperdays）堡，建筑了一个土穴。他住在那里，不再去打猎，只靠着人家的施济，除了大家施济给他的东西外，什么也不取。他十分忏悔他的罪恶，终日祷着上帝。”

“把克瓦的咽喉捉住。”



如此，格令巴代他舅父辩护了许多话，正当这时，他们看见山上走下了雄鸡张的克劳（Chanticleer），抬了一个尸架，躺在架上的，是一只死鸡，列那狐曾把她的头咬去，这必须抬来给国王看，使他知道。





5


张的克劳走上前来，悲悯地扑打着他的双手与他的翼膀。在尸架的两边，有两个悲戚的小雌鸡抬着，一个叫作康太，一个叫作克拉耶，死的是她们的姊姊，小雌鸡柯平。她们哭她们死去的姊姊，哭得十分悲切，她们母亲的哭声尤高，远远的便可听见了。这样的，他们这一大队伍走到狮王的面前。

于是张的克劳说道：“悲慈的主，我的王，请你垂听我的控告，我告的是列那狐，他大大地伤害我及这里立着的我的孩子们。四月的初旬，天气很好，我是很高兴，很骄傲，因为我的孩子很多。我有八个好看的儿子，七个好看的女儿，他们都是我妻子孵出来的，他们都很强壮而且肥胖，常到园中去走走，园的四周都有墙，还有六只大狗看守着，所以我的孩子们并不害怕。列那这贼，看着他们眼红，但又不能得到——这个残暴的贼常常在墙上走着，大狗们便扑过去，把他赶走了。有一次，他几乎被他们捉住了。

“张的克劳走上前来。”



“于是我们不见了列那好一会。后来他来了，装成一个隐士一样，带来一封信给我读，信上盖有国王的印，说道，国王要使国内人民全部平安乐业，各种的兽类、禽类，都不准侵害别的禽兽。他还对我说道，他现在是一个出家人了，他要大大地忏悔他的罪过。他还给我看他的隐士的衣服。于是他说道：‘张的克劳勋爵，此后你可以不用惧怕我，注意我了，因为我现在不再吃肉了。我现在要走了，要去唱祷歌了。上帝保佑你。’于是列那走了，说着‘克里独’，躺在一株山楂树下。那时我是又快活又高兴，并不去注意他了。我叫了我的孩子们集拢来，同到墙外去散步，然而我们却自此受下许多害，因为列那躺在密林中，轻轻地偷走到我们与门的中间，捉去了我的一个孩子，放到他背袋中。从此，他日夜等待着，偷去了我的许多孩子。我的十五个孩子现在只剩下四个了。其余的都被他吃掉了。昨天我的女儿柯平——就是现在躺在尸架上的，又被他捉去了，亏得被大狗救了回来。高贵的王，我向你恳求，请你可怜我所受的无理的大损害及我的好看的孩子们的失去！”





6


于是狮王说道：“猎猪勋爵，你听见你舅父，那位隐士所做的事了么？他又斋戒，又祷告，然而做出了什么事！现在，静下来，张的克劳，你的控告够了。你的女儿死了躺在这里，我们要为她举行葬礼。先把她光荣地葬了，然后再同诸位大臣商量怎样以正义与公理处置这个大谋杀者，叫这个虚伪的贼受法律的制裁。”

“后来他来了，装成一个隐士一样。”



葬礼举行后，狮王召集了他的大臣与最有智谋的咨议，商议怎样责罚列那狐。他们决定先差一个人去叫列那狐来对案，不要躲避着不来。白鲁因熊得了这个差使。

狮王对白鲁因熊道：“白鲁因勋爵，我派你做这个差使，但你自己要小心，因为列那是一个奸猾的、残暴的东西，他还晓得许多的诡计，会说谎，又会造谣；他竟要欺骗你，而且给你些当上呢。”

白鲁因道：“什么，我的主，不要说起这事！列那狐想欺骗我！我决不会上他的当的。”

于是白鲁因快活地从这里动身走了，但是恐怕他将不会再这样的快活了！





7


现在白鲁因是很高傲地向列那狐家里走去，他心里确认列那狐是不会戏弄他的。他走进一座黑暗的森林，列那在那里也有一条小路，预备被猎时逃走的。白鲁因要到马里卜台堡必须由此林中经过。列那有许多住宅，但马里卜台堡是其中最好、最安稳的一个。他于需要时，或有所惧怕时，便住到那里去。现在，白鲁因到了马里卜台了，他看见堡门紧闭着。于是他走到门前，坐在地上，叫道：“列那，你在家么？我是白鲁因。国王差我来叫你到宫廷去，辩护你的控案。国王立誓说，你不来或我带不来你时，你是要被判死刑的。他要绞死你，或把你摔死在岩石上。列那，听我的忠告，到宫廷去吧。”

列那躺在门内，如平日一样，在晒太阳。当列那听见白鲁因的话，便走到他的洞中去。马里卜台是到处都是洞的——这里一个洞，那里又一个洞，前面又是一个洞；狭的，曲折的，长的，还有许多路可以通到外边。这些通路，他可以随意启闭的。在他带了掳掠物回家，或做了什么坏事被追捉时，他便跑进来，藏身在秘密室中，以避仇人们，因此，他们便不能寻到他了：他用这个方法曾骗过了许多要追捉他的禽兽。这时，列那自己在想应该用什么方法使那熊受苦恼，他自己便可以安居不去。

于是，列那想定了计策，走了出来，说道：“白鲁因叔叔，我欢迎你！我听见你在外边很久了，但我正在做晚祷——所以不免延搁了一会。亲爱的叔叔，他使你走过这么长的山岭，真不是一个好差使，我见你很疲倦了，热汗流在两颊。这是不必来叫的：我明天一定会到宫廷上去的，但是，我现在觉得忧愁略减些，因为你的忠告可以在宫殿里帮助我。难道国王在你之外不能差了别一个到这里来么？那是大可惊奇的。因为，国王以下你就是最仁厚，最有兵力，土地最多的了。我很想我们现在立刻就动身到王宫，但因我吃了新的食物太多了，嘴里很难过，有些不便。”

于是熊说道：“亲爱的侄儿，你吃了什么东西，使你的嘴如此难过？”

“他看见堡门紧闭着。”



“亲爱的叔叔，我吃的是蜂蜜，我饿时便去吃。”

白鲁因叫道：“啊，列那，你说什么！你不喜欢蜂蜜么？我喜欢它比什么东西都甚些。好列那，帮我得到这些个蜜，我将终生做你的挚友。”





8


“白鲁因叔叔。我想你是在开玩笑。”

“天呀 ，列那，不。我一点也没有同你开玩笑。”

于是红列那说道：“那么，你这样的喜欢蜂蜜是实在的么？这蜜叫你们十个来饱吃一顿还吃不完。”

“不必我们十个，列那侄！”熊说道，“为什么要十个来吃？如果我有了这里和葡萄牙那里所有的蜜，我也能独自把它吃完。”

列那道：“你说什么，叔父？这里近旁住有一个农夫，名叫兰特福（Lantfert），他有无数的蜜，你便吃七年也吃不了。如果你待我以友谊，帮我反抗在国王面前控告我的仇人，这些蜜便可以在你的掌握之中了。”

于是白鲁因熊答应他说，如果他有得蜜吃饱，必定与列那成为忠诚的朋友，比谁都要好些。

狡狐列那笑了，说道：“如果你有七张嘴，我也可以使它们吃得饱饱的。”熊听得这话，喜欢非常，忍不住笑了出来。

于是列那想道：“好运气，我将领他到那里去，使他适度地笑笑。”

于是列那说道：“这事不必久延了，我必须为你辛苦一下。你要十分明白我对你的好意。”

笨熊谢了他。狐说道：“现在，叔叔，我们走吧，你跟着我。我可以使你有许多蜜，你简直吃不了。”他们同走了好久，到了农夫兰特福的农场里了。白鲁因勋爵觉得很高兴。

兰特福是一个木匠，据人说，他善于锯断大木头。前天他曾运了一株大橡树放在农场中，他已经开始锯解这块橡木了。他把两个木橛夹在已锯开的缝中，使它张裂着。列那见了很高兴，他已得到他所要的东西了，于是他笑着对那熊说道：“在这树里，蜜之多是不可计数的。你试到那里去看看，少吃些，因为蜜虽甜美，却不要吃得太多，能适量地吃，便可与身体无害；好叔叔，如果吃得太多而致病，我是要负责的。”

“什么，列那，侄儿，不必为我忧愁！你以为我是一个愚夫么？”

列那说道：“吃东西最好不过度。你去到树旁，爬进去。”

白鲁因熊匆匆地要取得那蜜，两只前足先伸入锯开的树缝中，头也伸了进去。列那轻轻地跳进，把木橛拔了出来。于是锯开的木合了拢来，把熊紧紧地夹在树缝中。这就是侄儿用骗术把他叔叔囚禁在树中的情形，他不能用力，也不能用智巧把他的头和足由树中拔出来。

白鲁因熊身体虽坚实有力，这时也无法可施。他很明白他是被欺骗了。他开始吼叫，后足挣扎着，发出的声响，已惊动了农夫兰特福。他匆匆地走出来，手里执着一把尖利的镰刀。白鲁因熊被夹在树缝中，又害怕，又着急。他挣扎着，吼叫着，都没有用。他不知怎样脱逃。

“把熊紧紧地夹在树缝中。”



列那狐远远地看见木匠兰特福来了，于是他对白鲁因说道：“那蜜好吃么？现在怎么样？不要吃得太多——吃多了对你身体是有害的，那时你便不能到宫廷去了。当兰特福来时，如果你已经吃得够了，他会给你水喝的，那么蜜便不会黏着在你喉咙口。”

列那说了这些话，他自己转身到他的堡中去了。兰特福来了，他看见那熊被紧夹在树中。于是他匆匆地跑到邻居家，叫道：“都到我天井里来——有一个熊被捉住了！”这句话传得极快，不久，所有男人、女人都来了，都尽力地快跑来，手里执着各种的武器——有的是木棒，有的是耙，有的是扫帚；教堂里的牧师也拿着神杖跑来，他的妻子也来了，连口中牙齿都没有的老太婆也跑来了。

白鲁因在此是以一当百的。他听见众人的喊声，挣扎着，尽力一挣，把他的头释放出来。但他的头皮及他的双耳都留在树缝中了。在他把双足拔出之前，足爪及足皮也都被留住了。他两足痛得不能走，又满头是血，流在眼睛中，连眼都睁不开，每个人都去打他，他只好无抵抗地呻吟着，顺受这些攻击。他们把他打得死去活来。他忍痛一跳，那边是大河，一班女人被挤落河中去了。牧师的妻也落在水里。牧师无心再去打熊了，急得大叫道：“她在水中！救她，救她！谁救得她起来，我把他的罪恶都赦免！”大家都依牧师吩咐去河中救人，把熊放在一边。熊见人都去了，便也跳入水中，尽力地游泳而逃。牧师见熊逃了，大怒，追在后面大叫道：“回来，你这贼！”他只作不闻，尽力地游泳。他心里咒骂那有蜜的树及列那狐，他使他受了这许多苦！他泅得疲了，爬上对岸，坐在那里休息。他呻吟着，叹息着，血流过双眼，痛彻心扉。

现在我们看那狐在这时做什么事。他乘机到兰特福家里，偷了一只肥鸡，匆匆地由一条小径走了。他向河边走去，心里很快活，想熊此时必已被打死了。他想道：“熊死了，宫廷上便无对证了。”到了河岸，却吃了一惊，原来白鲁因熊还好好地躺在那里休息，他心里异常的忧郁，而且很生气。“兰特福这个愚人！不得好死的！竟把握在手中的肥熊放走了！”他过了河，见白鲁因熊受着重伤，全身是血。列那狐便讥嘲地说道：“你偷了兰特福的蜜，付了钱没有？如果没有，那是很可耻的。我当代你去付给他。那蜜好吃么？你为什么戴了大红帽，把耳朵也罩得不见了。”

白鲁因熊听得这些话，愤怒异常，却又无力去报仇。他任凭列那说去，自己却一声不响地极痛苦地忍受着；后来，又跳入河中，泅到对岸去避他。他迟延了许久，才动身到国王那里去复命，一路上差不多是连爬带滚。他远远地爬滚来，国王端详了好久，才认得是他，心里不大高兴，说道：“这是白鲁因熊，我的朋友！天呀，谁打得他这样厉害？头全都变红了，几乎要被打死了。他在什么地方被打的呢？”

于是白鲁因熊走近国王面前，说道——

“慈悯的主，我的王，请你代我报仇，惩罚那个狡兽列那，我因为致你的使命，被他弄得如此。我的两只前足，我的双颊，我的双耳，都因他的奸谋而失去了。”

国王说道：“这个伪贼列那怎么敢如此？我对你说，白鲁因，我立誓要为你报仇。”

他召集大臣们，商议怎样处置列那。会议的结果是再叫人去召他来听审。他们想，特保猫奉行这个使命最适宜的，因为他很聪明。国王也以为是。





10


于是国王说道：“特保勋爵，你到列那那里，告诉他，这是第二次召他来听审。他虽然对别的兽类施凶，但他相信你，肯听你的话的。你对他说，如果他三次召不来，我们将以法绳他及所有他的亲族，决不宽贷。”

特保道：“我主，我求你另差别人去吧。我身体又小又弱。白鲁因熊那样强壮有力，都不能带他来，我怎么能够呢？”

国王道：“不，特保勋爵，你是聪明有学问的。智巧是比力量更有用的。”

特保只得答应了下来，不久，便动身向马里卜台去了。他到了那里，看见列那狐独自立在他的门前。

特保说道：“列那！国王召你去呢。他说，你这一次如果再不同我到宫廷去，他要杀死你呢。”

狐说道：“特保，好兄弟，我欢迎你！祝你运气好！”列那嘴里说着好话，心里却在想摆布他的计划。

“特保，好兄弟，我欢迎你！”



列那继续说道：“我们今天可以在一起么？我要为你接风。明天一早，我们便一同动身到宫廷去。好兄弟，听我的话吧。我没有一个朋友如你那样可信任的。白鲁因熊，那个奸细！我怎么会与他同去！但是，兄弟，我明天一早一定会同你走的。”

特保道：“最好我们现在就走。月光照得如同白昼：我从没有见过比今夜更好的天气。”

“不，好兄弟，夜间走路不大好，要犯疑的。今夜还是住在这里吧。”

特保道：“我们住在这里，吃些什么呢？”

列那道：“这里吃的东西很少。你可以有甜的蜜。你怎么说，特保，要别的么？”

特保答道：“这我不要。你还有别的么？如果你给我一只肥老鼠，我是更喜欢的。”

列那道：“一只肥老鼠！好兄弟，是你说的么？这里近旁，住有一个牧师，他家里有一所谷仓，那里有许多老鼠，便拿一辆马车还载不了他们呢。我听得牧师常常说，老鼠害他们不浅。”

“啊，好列那，引我到那里去，我一定尽力帮助你！”

“哈，特保，你说真话么？你果是这样的喜欢老鼠么？”

特保猫说道：“我爱老鼠比人给我的什么东西都甚些！鼠肉比什么都好吃，你领我去吧，以后什么都好商量。”

列那说道：“你同我开玩笑！”

猫说道：“天呀，我没有！”

列那道：“特保， 你开玩笑！”

特保道：“列那，我实在没有。如果我有一只肥老鼠，便拿勋爵给我换，我也不肯。”

狐道：“那么，我们走吧，特保，我带你到那个地方去。”

猫道：“列那，好的，我们就走。”

于是他们一同走到牧师的谷仓，仓的四周，围以泥墙。前一夜，列那狐曾由墙洞走进去，把牧师的一只肥鸡偷走了。牧师非常生气，在洞口布了一面罗网，要捉住他。这个恶贼，狐，早就知道了这事。他对猫道：“特保兄弟，爬进洞去吧。捉老鼠的时间不要太久了。吃够了就出来。我在洞外等候你。明天我们同到宫廷去。特保，你为什么不进去？”

特保道：“列那，你叫我进洞么？如果牧师要捉住我呢？”

狐说道：“啊，啊，特保！你怎么这样胆小？”

猫觉得羞愧便一跳进洞去了。恰恰的被捉在网中。这就是狡狐列那招待他兄弟，他客人之道了。

特保困在网中，十分害怕，他向前跳去，网也跟着往前。于是他吼叫起来，喧声很大。

列那站在洞口之外，听见他的吼声，自己很得意，对他说道：“特保，你喜欢你的老鼠么？肥不肥？牧师还会给你汤吃的。特保，你一边吃，一边唱——宫中的习惯是那样的么？天呀，如果依赛格林在这里，受你同样的待遇，我才快活呢，因为他常常危害我。”

特保逃不了，只是高声地咪叫着，惊得牧师醒了，他高叫道：“谢天谢地，我的网已捉住偷鸡贼了。起来，我们要惩戒他！”

牧师把家中的人都叫醒了，嚷道：“狐已捉住了！”

大家都奔到洞边，牧师的妻执着祭烛，牧师用大棒向猫没头没脑地打去，还把猫的一只眼挖去了。特保跳了起来，尽力咬了牧师一下，他大叫一声，向后倒了。他们忙乱地把他抬起，仍旧放在床上。狡狐列那，这时已经回转他的家了。特保见身旁无人，便乘此机会，把网咬开了一个大口，逃出洞外去了。他一颠一拐地跑到宫廷上去。这时天气很好，太阳光耀地照在空中。他上了列那的大当，身体被打得不成样子，眼也瞎了一只。国王见了特保的形状，听了他的告诉，更觉得震怒，立誓必把列那按律治罪。

列那的外甥格令巴说道：“我的主，请你再差人去叫他一次来听审。如果他这一次再不来，那么他的罪恶便是真实的了。”

国王道：“格令巴，你想谁要去叫他来呢？谁再肯牺牲了他的耳朵，他的眼睛，或他的生命，去召这个凶兽来呢？我以为这里没有这样的一个笨人了。”

格令巴说道：“上帝佑我，我就是这个笨人吧，我愿自己去走一趟叫列那来。你能命令我去么？”





11


狮王道：“现在，去吧，格令巴，好好地照顾你自己。列那是又凶险又狡猾，你必须留意他。”

格令巴说，他一定会自己留意的。

于是格令巴向马里卜台去了。当他到了那个地方时，他见列那狐在家里，他的妻爱美林夫人（Dame Ermelyn）同几个幼子躺在暗隅。

格令巴先对他的舅父舅母问过了好，然后对舅父列那说道：“舅舅，大家在控告你，你不到庭是有损无益的。现在最好同我一起到宫廷去，不能再迟延了。控告的事件很多，这一次是第三次的召唤了。我告诉你实话，如果你明天不去，便不会有什么好结果的。你将见三天之内，你的屋便要四面被围起来，拷问机、绞架都要立在屋前。我说实话，你那时将不能逃命，便连你的妻，你的子也将不能活了。国王说，他要将你全家都杀死。所以最好你还是和我同到宫廷去。你的聪明的狡辩会使你得机会打翻一切的控辞，使你的仇人们含羞而去。你已做过比这次更大的事许多回了。”

列那狐答道：“你说的不错。我想最好还是和你同去。如果我到国王那里当面和他相见，和他说话，也许他会怜悯我的。虽然我做了许多坏事，然而宫廷里不能没有我，那是国王很明白的。宫廷里最需要机警聪明的咨议，而我却是最好的咨议。不过，宫廷里恨我的太多，我心里总未免有些忧愁，因为人一多便会比一个人害我力量大。但我最好还是和你同去，甥儿，一人做事一人担，比之妻子一同受害总是好些。起来，我们走吧，我将忍受一切。”

列那对他的妻爱美林夫人说道：“我把孩子们托给你，你好好地看顾他们。我最小的孩子列金（Reynkin）尤须特别留心抚养。他十分的像我，我希望他能学我一样。如果上帝保佑我得逃命归来，我必定十分感谢你。”于是列那别了他的妻而去。

唉，上帝！爱美林是如何的忧苦呀！马里卜台的主人，粮食的供给者走了，家中将要绝食了。





12


当列那和格令巴同走了一会之后，列那说道：“好甥儿，我现在实是十分恐惧，因为我这次去是冒着生命之危险的。我很想忏悔我的罪恶，好甥儿，我要对你忏悔：这里没有牧师。如果我忏悔了自己的罪过，我的灵魂也可以清明些。”

格令巴答道：“舅舅，你要忏悔自己的罪过，先须答应不再出去盗窃东西。”

列那说，他愿意。“现在听呀，好甥儿，我要说了。我忏悔以前所做的种种坏事，希望能因此得赦罪。”

于是列那便开始说道：“我曾侵害过无数的禽兽——尤其是白鲁因熊，我的叔父，我使他的头全染了血；又教特保猫去捉老鼠，却有意害他陷入罗网，被人打得浑身是伤；我还大大地侵害张的克劳，把他的孩子吃去了许多。国王也不能除外——我曾污蔑他及王后许多次，他们自此永不能自己洗清。然而上我的当最多的还是依赛格林狼，我简直数不清有多少次。我叫他作‘叔叔’，其实不过骗骗他：他并不是我的亲族。在伊尔麦（Eelmare），我叫他扮成了一个教士，我自己也扮了一个。我把他的足缚在钟绳上，叫他去学撞钟。他把钟撞得十分的响，街上的人都惊骇起来，不晓得钟楼上出了什么乱子，大家都跑了来。他被他们几乎打得死去。此后，我又教他去捉鱼，他也因此受了不少下的打。我还引他到一个有钱的牧师家里去，这个牧师有一个储藏室，里面挂着许多块猪肉，我常常到那里去果腹，在这个储藏室我曾掘有一个洞，我叫依赛格林爬进去，他在里面吃得太多了，腹胀大了，不能爬出来。我于是跑到村中大嚷大叫，又跑到牧师那里，他正在桌上吃饭，在他面前有一块肥肉，我抢了它，便尽力地逃走了。牧师叫道：‘捉住那狐，杀死它！我想人永没有看见比这再奇怪的事。狐跑到我家里，从我桌上抢了肉去，人类中哪里有这样勇敢的贼！’于是他拿起餐刀，向我掷去，但没有掷中。他跟了我来，叫道：‘捉住那狐，杀了他！’我在前，他们在后追，人愈追愈多，他们都想伤害我。

“我跑了许久，到了依赛格林所藏的地方，我把那块肉放下了，因为太重，然后我由一个洞中逃出了。牧师追到，拾起肉来，看见狼在那里，大叫道：‘来呀，朋友们，贼在这里了，是狼！他现在不能逃了！’大家都来了，打得他极重，还拿大石掷他。他晕倒如死。他们把他抬出村外，抛入沟中。

“后来，我又引他到一个地方，说那里有七只雌鸡，一只雄鸡。旁有一个机关门。我对他说，如果他相信我，爬进这门，便可得许多肥鸡吃。依赛格林笑着爬进门，只爬进一点，说道：‘列那，你同我开玩笑，里面没有鸡。’我说：‘叔叔，你再爬进些，便可捉到了。要成功便须劳力与冒险。’他再爬进，却跌落在陷阱中了。睡着的人听见响声，起来点烛照看。他们见了他，把他打得半死。此外还有许多次类此的事， 我也不能立刻都想出来。现在我已忏悔完了，替我赦罪吧。”

格令巴是很机灵的，他从树上折下一枝，说道：“现在，你用这木棒在身上打三下，然后把它放在地上，直着腿跳跃三次，再把它拾起，与之接吻。如此，你今日以前所做的罪过便都可得赦了，因为我已都赦免了它们。”

列那狐很喜悦。

“狐跑到我家里，从我桌上抢了肉去。”



“叔叔，你再爬进些，便可捉到了。”



于是格令巴又对他舅舅说道：“舅舅，以后你要做好事了。读赞美诗，到礼拜堂去，给舍施，不再偷窃，不再欺骗人，那么，你便可被怜恤。”

列那答应说，他可以这样做，于是他们一同向宫廷走去。

离正路不远，有一所尼姑庵，庵门外有许多鹅呀鸡呀在游散，列那狐带着格令巴不走正路而向尼姑庵走去。列那狐看见一只肥小鸡离群走着，便去捉他，却被他逃走了。

格令巴说道：“怎么，舅舅，你做什么！你刚忏悔过，又要犯罪了？你应该痛自忏过。”

列那答道：“是的，甥儿，我全忘记了！求上帝恕我这一次，我以后不再这样做了。”

于是他们回身走过一座小桥。然而列那还时时回头望着那家畜场，他竟不能改过——黏着于骨里者不能从肉里取出。他虽在被绞死时，恐亦不能忘情于家畜场。

格令巴看他的样子，说道：“虚伪的人，你的双眼怎么时时望着家畜场那边！”

直到走上了正路，列那才不再回头看。他们向宫廷走去。他们将到宫廷时，列那心里震跳得很厉害！





13


在宫廷上的禽兽们，听见列那狐和他的外甥格令巴来了，大家便都在预备控告他的话。

“是的，甥儿，我全忘记了。”



列那狐同他的外甥走进宫廷，他外貌很镇定，毫不害怕，骄傲得如同王子，如同没有损人毫发的君子一样。他走到国王面前，立住了，说道，“上帝祝福我主。我是你的最忠实的仆人，永远是最忠实的。但是，亲爱的主，我很知道在这个宫廷上有许多仇人是要害我。但你不要相信这些谎话。他们这些狡猾的及虚伪的骗子，生来便是要谋害好人的。有一天，上帝总会报酬他们的。”

国王说道：“静下来，列那，你这恶贼，奸臣！你的假话造得很好！但都没有用。”

张的克劳不能再沉默了，他叫道：“唉！天呀，我受这个恶贼的害够了！”

国王道：“你不要喊，张的克劳，让我来对付这个恶贼。你说你极敬爱我，这就是表示在我的那两个使者，可怜的特保猫及白鲁因熊的身上的么？他们至今身上还都是血。不必多说，你将以你的生命酬报你的这些恶行。”

列那狐说道：“亲爱的主，有力的王，白鲁因的头上都是血，与我有什么关系？那是他自己到兰特福家里去偷蜜吃，所以被他们所打。再有特保猫，我很客气地款待他。那是他自己不听我的话，去牧师家里偷老鼠吃，所以被打，又与我有什么关系？我什么罪也没有。你可以随便烹我、烧我、绞死我，或把我两眼弄瞎了，我不能逃出你的权力之外，我们都在你的公正裁判之下。你是强而有力的，我是软弱的。如果你杀死了我，一定不会有人报仇的。”

这时，公羊与母羊站起来说道：“我的主，听我的控辞。”白鲁因熊和他的亲戚朋友也都站了起来。特保猫、依赛格林狼、克瓦兔以及野猪、骆驼、鹅、山羊、驴、牛、张的克劳鸡和他的母鸡及所有的孩子们——所有这些禽兽都大声喧叫，要国王把列那狐捉下定罪。





14


于是开了一次会议，他们决定列那狐应该判处死刑。当他们一个个控诉列那狐时，他都能个个的应付他们，敷设狡辞为他自己辩护。像列那那样聪明、机警，而且善于言辞的，禽兽中恐怕是没有第二个了。他的辩护的话，十分恳切而动人，听的人都很诧异。但，到了结果，国王与咨议大臣们下了判词了，他们判决列那狐应处死刑，用绳绞死。至此，他的狡辩与骗人的伎俩都无所展施了。判词一下，即须执行。他的外甥格令巴及他的许多有关系的兽类，不忍眼见他被处死，都很悲戚地离开，退出宫廷了。

国王看见有许多哭着退出的，自己说道：“列那虽然是狡恶的，他的亲人对他却是很好的。”

特保猫说道：“白鲁因爵士，依赛格林爵士，你们为什么这样慢？现在快要黄昏了。这里有许多树丛、篱笆。如果他乘机脱逃了，便不容易再捉住他了。我们要去绞死他么？你们为什么站着不动？等到绞架造好，已经要晚上了。”





15


依赛格林说道：“如果我们有一条坚固的绞绳，立刻可把他结果了。”

列那狐好久没有说话，这时对依赛格林说道：“请减短我的痛苦。特保有一条强固的绳子，这绳子是牧师家里的，曾捉住他过。他会爬树，爬得又快，让他把绳挂好了。我很忧愁，我活了这么长久，快一点，不要迟延了。白鲁因，你在前引路；依赛格林你紧紧地跟着仔细监督着，不要让我逃走了。”

白鲁因说道：“列那说的话，是最好的建议了。”

于是他们立刻动身走了。依赛格林立在这边，白鲁因立在那边，如此的，他们引导列那到绞架上去。特保在前跑，他去结绳。尊贵的国王与王后以及所有在宫廷上的，都跟在后面，去看列那的结局。列那很害怕，心里在想，怎样才能救他自己；怎样才能欺骗那三个最望他死的仇人而使他们受羞辱；怎样才能用谎话使国王帮助他反对他们。他想了许久，自己暗说道：“国王和许多禽兽都怒我，这是无怪其然的，我是应受的。然而，不管国王如何的有权力，他的左右如何的聪明，如果我一说话，我便要把自己升在如他们置我于绞架上的地位一样高了。”

那时，依赛格林说道：“白鲁因爵士，现在你想想因那列之故你的头全红了，我们这时应该报仇了。特保！快点爬上去，把绳子紧缚在树上，再打一个死结；白鲁因，紧紧地捉住他，不要让他逃走了。我要将梯子放好了，叫他走上去。”

白鲁因说道：“好的。我将好好地帮助他。”

列那狐说道：“现在我心里很恐惧，因为我看见死在我的眼前，我不能逃脱。我的主，国王，我亲爱的王后，还有站在这里的所有的大众，我在离开这个世界之前，我要求你们一件事，我要在你们大众之前，公开地忏悔我自己，把我的罪恶都说出来。我的死可以容易些，你们大众求上帝怜恤我的灵魂！”





16


大众听了列那这一席话，都很可怜他，一同向国王说，这是一个小小的要求，不妨答应他。于是国王便答应了他。

列那很喜欢，希望结果可以更好些，于是他说道：“在这里的，我差不多都有侵害他们的地方。然而当我幼时，我是最好的孩子之一。我后来去和众羊游戏，因为我有听见他们的悦耳的叫声。我和他们同在了许久，后来咬了一只羊，这是我第一次去学舐血。血的味道很好。以后我便开始去吃肉，我觉得很好吃，所以后来我便到森林中去，听见有小羊的叫声——我杀了他们两只。我开始很勇敢地做这些事了。我杀了鸡、鸭、鹅之类，只要我能寻到他们。我的嘴都染了血。以后，我益发凶残了，只要我能寻到可以制服他们的东西，我便都把他们杀死了。以后，我遇到了依赛格林，那时是冬天，他藏在一株树下，他对我说，他是我的叔叔。我听了这话，便认他为亲属，我们成了同伴，至今我还很后悔。我们相约大家要互相诚实，好好地相待，于是便开始一同游行。他偷大的东西，我偷小的东西，所有的东西都平分，然而他总是得到最多——我还得不到应得的一半。当依赛格林捉得一头小牛，一只公羊，或一只羯羊，于是他便同我生气了，把我驱逐开了，我的一份便也归了他。这还是小的事。但当我们运气很好，得到了一头牛，那么他的妻带了七个孩子来了，于是我所得的不过一段最小的肋骨，然而我并非不满足，因为我有无数的金银珍宝，七个车子还载不了。”

“我要在你们大众之前，公开地忏悔我自己。”



国王听到他说有许多金银珍宝，贪心顿炽，问道：“列那，后来那金银怎么样了？告诉我。”

狐说道：“我的王，我要告诉你的。金银幸亏被偷了。如果这些金银不被偷，你的生命便要危险，你便要被奸人暗害了——那是上帝所不许的！也是世界上最大的损害。”

王后听了这话，十分的恐惧，高声叫道：“啊，列那，你说的什么？我求你公开地说出这件大谋杀事件的真相，使大家都得听见！”

现在听列那怎样的煽动国王与王后，赢得了他们的好感与爱意，且中伤了那些图谋置他于死地的仇人。他说谎话，说得异常动听，好像那些事是真的。

狐以忧戚之容，对王后说道：“我现在必须死了，但我很可怜他要被他自己的人所谋害。”

国王心里很忧郁，说道：“列那，你对我说的是真话么？”

狐说道：“是的，我快死了，难道还造谎话，使我灵魂再受苦么？”说到死字时，他故意浑身发抖，表示害怕。

王后很可怜他，要求国王叫大众静静的，听狐说话。

于是国王命令大众不得喧哗，听列那说话。

狐说道：“你们现在都要静静的，那是国王的意思，我要公开地告诉你们这个叛谋了。我决不让那些有罪的得以漏网。”





17


现在听列那怎样开始。他先叫他的外甥格令巴来，以便在要紧时可以帮助他。于是他开始说道：“我的主，我父亲曾寻找到爱曼里克王（King Ermeryk）埋藏在地坑中的金宝，他得到这些财宝，便十分的骄傲，蔑视他以前的同伴。他差特保猫到白鲁因熊那里，向他表示敬意，并说他如果要做国王，便请到法兰特（Flanders）来。白鲁因熊十分的喜欢，因为他久想得到这个高位！于是他便到法兰特来，我父亲待他很尽敬爱。不久他又叫了格令巴、依赛格林狼、特保猫来，他们到一个僻地开会，商议了一夜。他们欲利用我父亲的财宝，谋杀了国王。现在，请静听这个奇事！他们议决举白鲁因为国王。如果我主的朋友有反对的，我父亲便可用财宝去取去他们的力量。

“第二天清早，格令巴吃醉了酒，把这事告诉了他的妻，叫她严守秘密。但她不能守秘密，又把这事告诉了我的妻，但要她立誓不告诉别人。但她却告诉了我，我至今守着这秘密。她说得很详细，我非常害怕，毛发都竖起来，我的心重得如铅，冷得如冰，我知道白鲁因是狡猾凶暴的，如果他做了王，我们便都要受苦了。我知道我的主，尊贵的王，出身极高，又有力，又公正，又仁慈。我实实地在想，一个尊贵有力的好狮王，换了一个凶恶的贼，那是如何的一个变迁！于是我时时想设法破坏他们的计划。我常常祷告上帝使我们的王常是光荣、康健，而且给他以长生，但我很明白，那些财宝如果在我父亲手里，他们一班人便会利用之以推翻王室，我便立意要侦探父亲藏宝的地方。我不管日夜，不管晴雨，不管寒热，时时，暗中跟在父亲之后，要探出财宝的所在。有一次，我伏在地上，看见我父亲从一个洞中出来，他仔细地观察四围有没有人。以后，他便用沙把洞口掩盖了，与平地一样，一点也看不出来异处。我等他走了，便跳到洞边，用足把沙扒出，钻进洞去，发现洞中堆有无数的金银。于是我叫我的妻爱美林帮助我，日夜苦作地把这些财宝搬到另一个地方，藏在一个深洞中，同时，我父亲与白鲁因、依赛格林正在进行他们的叛谋。我父亲到处招兵，允许先给一个月的俸金，帮助白鲁因举行大事。归来后，我父亲便到藏金的地方去看，不料洞口大开，财宝已失。他又气又悲，自己上吊死了。于是白鲁因的逆谋便告了结束。现在，我真是倒运！奸贼依赛格林和白鲁因居然为大臣，与我的王坐在一处议事，而我呢，可怜的列那，却没人酬我，没人谢我！”

“他们议决举白鲁因为王。”



国王与王后想得到那些财宝，便追问列那，把那些财宝究竟运藏在什么地方。王后道：“列那，你说了，国王将赦了你不杀，且完全不追究你的罪，以后你当忠顺于我的主。”

列那对王后说道：“亲爱的后，如果国王相信我，肯赦我一切前罪，那么，我便要使他成一个千古所无的最富的王。”

国王道：“我的后，你相信列那狐的话吗？不要理他，他是生来偷盗说谎的。这已黏附他的骨上，不能由肉里取出了。”

王后道：“不，我主，你现在可以相信他了。他以前虽坏，现在已变了一个样子了。”

“看见我父亲从一个洞中出来。”



国王道：“那么，照你的意思做去。他如果再欺骗，我现在立誓必要严厉地惩治他及其亲属。”

列那心里暗喜，说道：“我主，我如说谎，真是太不聪明了。”

国王于是赦了列那的罪，并及他父亲的。列那这时心里之异常快活，是不足异的，他免了死罪，且更不怕一切仇人了，他说道：“我的主，我的后，上帝保佑你们给我以大恩典。我感谢你们，你将要成世界上最富的王了。我现在谨献上爱曼里克王所有的财宝给我主。”

国王心里很快活，谢了列那狐。

列那狐心里暗暗好笑。他继续着说道：“我的主，请你记好了我的话！在法兰特的西边，有一座森林，名叫赫尔斯特洛（Hulsterlo），森林旁有一条河名叫克里铿辟（Krekenpyt）。这是一片极大的荒地，财宝就藏在那里。请你记住地名克里铿辟。你到了克里铿辟，便会看到两株赤杨树，树旁就是藏宝的坑洞。你可以在那里找到金块、银块，还有爱曼里克王生前所戴的王冠，如果白鲁因叛谋成功，这王冠便是他戴了。你还可以看见值钱的珠宝，宝石镶在金饰中，值得好几千金。我主，你得了这许多财宝。心里便要常常地想道：‘呵，你是如何的忠诚，列那狐，你真聪明，把财宝藏得这样好！’”

国王道：“列那勋爵，你必须和我们同去掘这宝藏，因为我不识路，我没有听见过克里铿辟这个地名。”

列那道：“这个地名是真的，我当叫一个见证来。”他便高声叫道：“克瓦兔，到国王面前来。”克瓦兔浑身发抖，列那道：“克瓦，你着了凉么？怎么发抖起来？不要怕！请你在国王、王后之前说真话。你说，克里铿辟在什么地方？”

“克瓦兔，到国王面前来。”



兔说道：“我十二年之前熟悉这个地方。它在一座名赫尔斯特洛的森林之中。我在那里受过许多饥寒。僧人西莫尼（Symonet）常在那里造假币。”

列那道：“下去吧，国王要听的话已够了。”那兔便走了下去。

狐说道：“我的主，我的话没有错么？”

国王道：“不错的，列那，原谅我。我不应该不相信你。现在，列那，和我们一同走去掘宝吧。”

狐说道：“与我主同去是很光荣的。但我不能去！因为前时依赛格林狼曾入教为僧，因为食粮太少，他觉得极苦，生了病。我很可怜他，便叫他逃走。因此，我犯了教律。我明天便要到罗马去求赦罪，以后再到圣地去。”

国王道：“列那，我可以叫克瓦同到克里铿辟去，我劝你必须脱离这个罪。”

那狐说道：“我主，所以我必须愈快到罗马愈好。我将日夜不休息，直到我的罪被赦之后。”

国王道：“列那，我想你已变了一个好人了。上帝保佑你成就你的愿望。”

国王说完了话，便坐在一块大石上，叫大众静默勿言，各按等级，成为一圈，坐在草地上。列那立在王后身旁。于是国王说道：“在这里的大众都听着！列那犯罪应绞，现在因他很出力， 我与王后赦了他的罪，回复原官。你们必须敬礼他及他的妻子。我也不再愿意听别人来控诉列那了。他明天要到罗马去求赦罪，还要渡海到圣地去，直到所有他的罪都被赦了才回家来。”

乌鸦特塞林（Tyselyn）听见了这一席话，便跑到依赛格林、白鲁因及特保那里，说道：“你们不幸的人，还在这里做什么？列那狐被赦了，且成了一个侍臣，在宫中很有势力。国王已赦了他的所有的罪过。你们都被卖了。”

依赛格林说道：“怎么回事？我想特塞林你是说着谎话。”

乌鸦说道：“我没有说谎，真的事。”

于是狼与熊都到国王那里去。特保猫十分谨慎，他不愿意再见列那。





18


依赛格林很骄傲地走到国王面前，很凶恶地骂着列那。国王听了大怒，下令把狼与熊都缚了起来。他们被捆缚得极紧，整个晚上，他们的足与手都丝毫不能转动。现在看狐怎么办！他恨他们。他设法向王后说，他动身时要用一尺长一尺宽的熊皮做背囊，还有，他要四只坚固的靴，以便走远路。他对王后道：“我后，我现在是你的朝陵使了。我的叔父依赛格林有四只靴，恰好合我用。我要他给我两只靴，还有他的妻，我的婶母，也要给我两只，她不大出门，没有靴也不要紧。”

王后道：“列那，这些靴你必定要的，因为你要爬山过岭。依赛格林及他的妻的靴，正合你用，又好又坚固。我叫他们每人给你两只。取下来虽痛，也无法，因为朝陵是要事。”





19


于是这个虚伪的朝陵者从依赛格林那里取得了两只靴。你看他取下时是如何的痛苦呀！他不能动弹，足上血淋淋的。其次是他的夫人的份了，她躺在草地上，脸上悲愁着。她失去了她的两只后靴。

列那很高兴，讥嘲地对他的婶母说道：“好婶母，为我之故，你受了多少苦？我要穿了你的靴，你将是朝陵的伴侣了，我得赦罪，你也可以有福了。”

母狼气得一句话也说不出。她终于说道：“唉，列那，现在随你怎么说都可以，我祈求上帝复仇！”

依赛格林与他的伴侣白鲁因，一句话也不说，他们静默地躺着。他们很难过，因绳子捆得极紧，已受了伤。如果特保猫也在此地，他便也将受些苦了，亏得他机警，没有同来。

第二天，太阳升起时，列那把从依赛格林及他的妻那里取来的靴，用油抹了，穿在足上，用带缚住，走到国王及王后那里，以快乐的面目，对他们说道：“高贵的王与后，我要走了，我要求你们给我背囊及棒子。”

国王叫巴林（Bellyn）羊给列那背囊及棒子，这背囊便是以白鲁因熊的皮为囊面的。于是列那要动身了。他向国王望着，好像他不舍得离别；又似要哭出来的样子，好像他心中真的难过。他想，不要延搁太久了，还是快走的好，因他自知有罪。

国王道：“列那，我忧你如此匆忙。不再耽搁。”

“不，我主，是时候了，我求你让我动身，我必须走了。”

国王道：“上帝与你在一起！”他叫全宫的人都去送列那一程，只有狼与熊被紧缚在地上，不能走。列那心里暗笑，国王起初如此恨他，后来竟让他愚弄了。

列那道：“我主，我请求你不要再送了。你那里还有两个奸臣被缚在地上呢。如果他们逃了，为害不浅，我求上帝保佑你！”于是他以后足立起来，为一切大的小的禽兽祝福，他们也祝福他。他快活地向克瓦兔及巴林羊说道：“朋友们，我们现在就分离么？你们与上帝将伴我再走几程。你们身份既高，又和蔼可亲，走在一处是最好不过的。”他说了好些欺骗的话，一直把他们引到他的屋马里卜台那里。





20


当列那走到他家门前，他对巴林羊说道：“兄弟，请你等在这里，不要走开，我和克瓦要走进去。因为我要求克瓦安慰我的妻子。”

巴林道：“我愿他能安慰得下他们。”

列那骗了克瓦进去。他们看见爱美林夫人和她的孩子们躺在地上，他们十分焦急，恐怕列那受了死刑。但是，她竟又见他回来了，她十分的喜欢。但，当她见他的背囊、棒子及靴子，又觉得奇异，问道：“亲爱的列那，你怎么逃走的？”

“一直把他们引到他的屋马里卜台那里。”



他道：“我被捉到宫廷，但国王叫我走去。我必须去朝陵。我谢谢国王把克瓦给我们，可以随意处置。国王他自己说，克瓦是第一个控告我们的人，我们可以复仇。”

克瓦听见这些话，怕了起来。他想要逃，又不能够，因为列那正站在他与门之中间。列那把他的颈捉住。于是克瓦叫道：“救命呀，巴林，救命呀！你在哪里？他要杀我了！”但一会这声音便没有了，因为列那已把他的喉管割断了。

他说道：“现在我们且吃这只肥兔吧。”小狐们也来了。他们有了一席大宴，因为克瓦的身体很肥胖。爱美林吃肉饮血，她刻刻谢那国王使他们如此快乐。列那道：“你且尽量地吃吧。”她道：“列那，你把别后的事告诉了我吧。”

“夫人，我骗了国王与王后，我想，我们的交情并不厚。当他们知道了这事必定都生气，立刻会捉我去绞死的。所以我们还是离开这里，偷偷地走到别的森林中去，无忧无惧地生活着，我们就是住七年，他们也不会寻到。那里有许多好食物，如鹧鸪、雉鸡以及许多别的野禽。有清溪，又有清新的空气。我们的生活平稳，安逸，且又富有。因为我告诉国王有大堆财宝在克里铿辟，但实在是没有。他如知道被骗，一定要大生气。我不愿意再落在他手中了。”

爱美林夫人说道：“列那，我劝你不要搬到别的地方去了。我们在那里没有一个朋友。我们在这里，什么都有。你是这一地的人民的主人，为什么要迁居到坏的地方去呢？如果国王来捉，我们有许多旁路小径可以逃走，不怕他们来。”

列那听了她的劝告，道：“是的，他如逼我太甚，我是要捉弄他的。如果他要求害，他便将得害。”

现在巴林羊因克瓦在洞中许久不出来，生气起来，高声叫道：“出来，克瓦，列那为什么把你留在那里这样长久？你快一点出来！我们走吧！”

“救命呀，巴林，救命呀！”



列那听见了他的话，走了出来，温和地对巴林羊说道：“亲爱的巴林，你为什么生气呢？克瓦正和他婶母说话。请你不要生气。他叫我告诉你先走，他会追来的：他比你跑得快。他还要与他婶母及她的孩子们耽搁一会，他们都哭着，因为我将要离开他们走。”

巴林道：“克瓦怎么样了？我仿佛听见他喊救命。”

狐答道：“你说什么，巴林？你以为他有什么危险么？现在听我说他那时的事。当我们走进屋内，我的妻爱美林知道我要过海朝陵，便晕倒在地。克瓦见了，大叫道：‘巴林，来助我婶母，她晕倒了。’”

羊道：“诚心地说，我知道克瓦有大危险。”

狐道：“这是不对的，如果克瓦在我家里受什么害，我的妻子便要受许多苦处了。”





21


狐说道：“巴林，你不记得昨天国王命令我离开此地之前要给他两封信么？好兄弟，我求你把这两封信带去，它们已经写好了。”

羊道：“我不知道这事。如果你的信写得好，还有装信的东西，我可以把它们带去。”

列那道：“你可以有东西装信。我要把我的背囊给你，把送给国王的信放在里面。你会得国王的感谢的。”

因此，巴林答应把这两封信带去。

列那回到屋内，把背囊取出，放进克瓦的头颅，然后把这背囊交给巴林，要使他受危险。他把背囊挂在巴林颈上，再三嘱咐道，如果他要得国王的欢心，千万不要偷看背囊中的东西。“如果你要使国王尊重你，喜爱你，你要说，这个是你自己代我写的，并说这信写得如何的好。然后你便可以得到国王的感谢了。”

巴林羊很高兴，他想国王会感谢他的，说道：“列那，我很知道你现在为我做的事。如果大家知道我能够写得很好的信，我在宫廷中便要大被称赞了，虽然我本是不会写信的。一人做的工作，常常有被别人得其名誉的，我现在也要得别人的工作之名誉了。现在，你有什么话说，列那？克瓦兔和我一同到宫廷中去么？”

狐道：“不，他立刻便要跟你来了。他现在还不能出来，因为正在和他婶母说话。你先走吧。我要对克瓦说秘密的事。”

巴林道：“再见，列那。”于是他向宫廷走去。他急急地跑，一直奔到宫中，看见国王和大臣们都在朝中。国王看见了熊皮做的背囊又被带回来，觉得奇怪。他问道：“说，巴林，——你从什么地方来？狐在哪里？他为什么不把背囊带去？”

巴林道：“我主，我将告诉你一切的事。我伴列那到他家里，他问我可否带两封信给我主。我说，为国王之故，便带七封信也高兴。于是他给我这个背囊，信就在囊中。这信是我写的，我还参加些意见在内。我想，你以前不会见过写得这样好的信。”

国王立刻命令他的秘书博卡（Bokart）读这封信，因为他懂得各种的文字。特保猫和博卡从巴林颈上把背囊取下。

秘书博卡解开背囊，把克瓦的头颅取出，说道：“这是什么信！我主，这是克瓦的头颅。”

国王道：“唉，我总是相信这狐！”大家可以知道国王和王后是如何的懊丧。国王生气得把头低下，想了许久，不禁大叫了一声，所有的禽兽闻这叫声都惊怕起来。

勋爵菲拉辟（Firapeel）豹和国王有些亲谊，这时他说道：“我的王，怎么叫得这样响！你忧苦得如同王后死了。不要自苦了，好好地想想吧。这是大羞耻。你不是这个地方的主人与王么？这里的人不是全在你之下么？”

国王道：“菲拉辟勋爵，我怎么能忍得下这口气呢？一个狡贼与骗子欺哄了我，竟使我对不住我的朋友白鲁因熊与依赛格林狼。我十分懊悔。我疏远了最好的大臣们，反去信任了一个狡狐，这真与我的威信有关。我的妻也不好，她那样的求我，我听了她的话，我现在懊悔太迟了。”

豹道：“我主，事情虽做错了。现在还可以补救。我们可以给还白鲁因以他的皮及依赛格林与他的妻的靴——因为有巴林羊在那里呢。他自己承认说，克瓦之死，他是参与的，所以他须偿命。我们全体都去捉列那，把他捉住了绞死，不必再审判。那不是什么都满足了么？”





22


国王道：“就依你的话做去吧。”

“所以他须偿命。”



于是菲拉辟豹到了狱中，释放了白鲁因及依赛格林出来，对他们说道：“勋爵们，国王叫我放了你们，我主的爱与友谊仍在你们身上，他很懊悔，且很忧愁对你们的不对，所以你们就可以有好的升迁了。他还给你们以巴林羊及他的亲属，从此以后，你们遇见了他们，不问在田野中，森林中，你们都可以吞吃他们，不必顾虑。他还允许你们，去猎捉列那及所有他的亲属，可以随意报仇。”

菲拉辟的一席话，恢复了国王和白鲁因、依赛格林的感情。只苦了巴林羊及他的亲属，他失了外套，失了生命，以后狼属还有吞吃他亲属的特权。到了现在，他们遇见了巴林的亲属，还是吞吃。

国王和大臣们大宴了十二天，为了宠爱熊与狼，这个和解使他十分的高兴。





23


所有各种的兽类，都到这个大宴会来，因为国王使人通知国内各地。群兽的快乐与高兴是从来少见的。他们跳舞歌乐。国王给了许多的食物，大家都吃得醉饱。他的国内，所有大的小的兽类俱到了这里来，还有许多飞鸟也都飞来。只有列那狐，那个红眼睛的假的朝陵者，他躺在家里想做坏事，他以为他到这里来是有害无益的，所以不敢来。食物与酒到处都是。快乐的游戏，无一刻停。宴会中充满了喜悦。

正当第八日，中午的时候，大兔拉卜里（Lapreel）走到国王面前，他正与王后坐在一处，拉卜里悲苦地说道：“我的主，请你可怜我，听我的控告。昨天早晨，列那狐几乎杀了我。昨天，我正走过他的家马卜里台，他站立在门外，好像一个朝陵者。我想和和平平地经过他身旁，到这里来赴宴。但他看见我来了，迎面挡住，不说一句话，伸出左足，打在我的颈上，我以为我的头颅要落下了，但谢上帝，我竟得逃命。我痛苦地从他爪下逃出，失去了一只耳朵，头上还有四个大洞，是他的尖锐的爪印，血涌出来，我几乎要晕倒。为了要生命，不得不忍痛飞逃，他追我不上。看，我主，他用利爪捉我的大创痕！我求你可怜我，惩罚这个虚伪的奸臣与谋杀者，不然，恐没有动物经过那里会得平安的了。”





24


大兔的话才说完，乌鸦柯班特（Corbant）飞进来，立在国王之前，说道：“亲爱的主，听我的话！我向你申诉可怜的控辞。我今天早上和我的妻夏比（Sharpebok）同到草地上散心，列那躺在地上好像一个死物。他的眼珠定着，他的舌头长长地挂在嘴外，好像一只已死的猎狗。我们走近，触触他的嘴，觉得没有生气。于是我的妻走上去，把她的耳朵放在他口边，去听听看他有没有呼吸，因此，遇到了噩运。因为这个凶残的狡狐，正在等待他的时机。当他看见她如此的近他，他便把她的头咬住，把它咬断了。我见了，十二分的悲怒，大叫道：‘不好了！不好了！做什么？’他立刻立了起来，向我走来。我怕被杀，浑身战栗着，飞到一株树上停下，远远地看这个恶贼把她吞吃了，连一根骨也不留下——只有几根羽毛散在地上。他极饿，好像两只都可以吃得下。吃完了，他走开了。我悲戚地飞下来，把羽毛集拢来，现在带到这里给你看。我生平没有受过这样的痛苦与惊恐。我的主，你看这是如何可怜。这些是我妻夏比的羽毛！我主，如果你要保持尊严，你必须对此事有公平的裁判，将恶贼治以相当之罪，使大家都敬畏你，不然，便连你自己恐也不能安稳地坐着了。因为国王不公平，不加盗贼以刑罚，任他们胡行，便要人人思乱，大家都要做王了。我的爱主，请你留意。”

“我痛苦地从他爪下逃出。”





25


高贵的国王听了大兔与乌鸦的控辞，十分生气，生气得眼睛如火般照耀，形状很可怕。他高声地吼叫起来，所有宫廷上的人都怕得发抖了。后来，他叫道：“我以皇冠立誓，不能忍受这个狡贼的戏弄！我的安全，我的命令都被破坏了，我为他所愚，我竟信了这个狡贼。他的虚伪的假话，哄骗了我。他告诉我他要到罗马，从那里过海到圣地去。我给他背囊及棒子，使他为一个朝陵者，我以为都是真的。唉！他真狡恶！但这都因我的妻，都是她劝我的。我竟听了妇人的话！我求，我命令，所有忠于我的，要与我为友的，不管他们在这里或不在这里，都要以其智或力帮助我复这个大仇。我们捉住了他，便不再会受骗受害了。”

依赛格林狼及白鲁因熊，听了国王的话，十分的希望能对列那狐复仇，但他们不敢说一句话。国王是这样的生气，没有一个人敢开口。

后来，王后说道：“一个贵人不要轻信，也不要太生气，须等明白了一切之后。他须倾听别一部分人的话。我初以为狐改好了，不再骗人了，所以我尽力地帮助他。但我以为不管他是好，是坏，你为保存威信，不应该太匆促地反对他。那是不公平的，因为他不能逃出你的手外。你可以囚他，杀他，他必须服从你的裁判。”

菲拉辟豹说道：“我主，我想我后的话是对的，你听她的话吧。如果列那是如大家所控的有罪的，你便按律治他。”

依赛格林狼道：“菲拉辟勋爵，我们的意见与你一样。不过列那现在如果在这里，即使他能把所有的罪都洗刷清，我也要取他的命；可惜他现在不在这里，我只好不说什么话。然而，在一切事之上的是，他曾告诉国王说有无数财宝埋在克里铿辟。这是一个空前的大谎，他因此害了我们，使我和熊受了大苦。我敢以性命为赌，他说的没有一个字是真实的。国王的使者已经通知他了，他要来，便可以到这里来了。”

国王道：“我们不再去叫他来了。我命令所有在我下面的，服从我的，在六日之后，预备开战，所有弓箭手、步兵、马兵，等等，带了弓箭枪炮，都到马里卜台，把它围困起来。我如是一个国王，我必毁灭了列那狐。你们大家的意见如何？你们愿意这样做吗？”

他们全都喊道：“我的主，你要如何，我们便全体跟你去！”





26


格令巴獾猪听见了这一切话，他是列那的外甥。他又急又愤，立刻由大路向马里卜台奔去。他不管丛林，不管篱笆，都飞越过去，奔得满身是汗。他替他的红眼睛的舅舅列那着急，他一路奔，一路自言自语道：“唉，你是怎样的危险呀！你的结果如何！难道我看着你由生入死，或被逐出国外么？我实在焦急。你是我们亲戚中的头领，你善于计谋；你的朋友们有急难时，你都肯帮助他们；你善于设辩，你一说话便征服了一切。”

格令巴这样匆促地到马里卜台，看见他的舅舅列那站在那里，他正得了两只鸽子，提回家去，这两只鸽子是第一次出巢学飞，因为羽毛未丰，便跌落在地上，列那正出来找食物，所以便捉住他们。

当他见格令巴走来，便道：“欢迎，我最爱的甥儿。你跑得太快，浑身都是汗了。有新闻么？”

格令巴道：“舅舅，不得了了，你将有失去生命财产的危险！国王立誓要杀死你。他命令所有他的部下于六日内都到这里来。弓手、步兵、马兵、乘车的兵，带着弓箭枪炮，等等，还带有火把呢。请你留心，他们要捉住你。依赛格林及白鲁因现在国王身边，比之我和你还亲近，他们的话他都听。依赛格林使大家相信你是一个贼，一个谋杀犯。大兔拉卜里和乌鸦柯班特也在控告你。我怕你生命有危险，已因惧恐而将生病了。”

狐道：“呸！好甥儿，此外没有别的事了么？你便这样怕么？勇敢些，放宽心肠。即使国王及全个宫廷的人都要我死，我也能设计打胜了他们的全体。宫中不能没有我。”





27


“好甥儿，不必挂念这些事，进这里来，看我给你什么东西——好一对肥鸽，我最爱此物。他们味道极好，几乎可以全个吞下去——骨头一半是血。我自己觉得要伤胃，所以只吃些清淡的东西。我妻子很喜欢见你，但不要告诉她这个事，恐她要过于愁苦。明天清早，我将和你同到宫廷去，我要以巧辩制服他们全体。外甥，你能帮助我么？”

格令巴道：“自然的，舅舅，所有我的财产随便你用。”

狐道：“谢谢你，外甥！如果我生还，我要偿还你的。”

格令巴道：“舅舅，你到了大家面前，善自设辞。你在说话之时，他们是不会捉你的。王后和豹都如此主张。”

狐道：“如此，我很高兴；如此，我可以一点也不必注意他们了，我将救出我自己。”

他们不再说话，走进洞中，见爱美林和她的孩子们正坐着，她看见他们来了，便立了起来迎接。格令巴问了舅母及表弟妹们好。列那带来的两只肥鸽子，做了他们的一顿晚餐。狐道：“好甥儿，你喜欢我的孩子洛赛尔（Rossel）和列那定（Reynerdine）么？他们为我们全属增光。他们已经很能干了。他们都曾捉住过小鸡，还知道怎样的扑在水中去追夏鹅及鸭。我常叫他们去打猎，不过我先教他们逃避罗网、猎人及猎狗之法。他们捉捕得极敏捷，我十分喜欢。”

格令巴道：“舅舅，你有聪明的孩子，可以高兴了，我也很高兴，因为他们也是我的亲人。”

狐道：“格令巴，你流过汗，很疲倦了。现在应该休息了。”

“舅舅，你如喜欢，我也觉得可以睡了。”于是他们便躺在草床上。狐，狐的妻，他的孩子们全都去睡了，但是狐心里很忧愁，叹着气，细想他应该怎样饰辞自解。

第二天清早，他离了他的家，和格令巴一同走了。在临走之前，他先与他的妻爱美林夫人告别，且说道：“我必须和外甥格令巴同到宫廷里去。如果我耽搁了几天未回，你不要怕；如果你听得什么坏消息不要轻信它。你自己保重，好好地看管着家。我在那里当随机应变，尽力做去。”

她说道：“唉，列那，你为什么又要到宫廷去了，上一次你到了那里几乎送了性命，你还说，将不再回来。”

狐道：“夫人，世上的事情是很奇异的，它的进行常与预料相反。有许多人想着要得一件东西，而这件东西却是他必定得不到的。我现在必须到那里去。请宽心不要怕。我希望至迟五天之内可以再回家。”

于是他离了家，与格令巴同向宫廷走去。一路上，列那说道：“外甥，我又做了许多狡事。我现在告诉你这一切：我使熊受了大创，把他的皮割了一块下来，做了一个背囊；还叫狼和他的妻都失了一对的靴；我用大谎话哄骗国王，告诉他说，狼和熊要反叛，想谋杀他，因此，我使国王大大地恨怒他们，实则这是冤枉的；我还告诉国王说，有一注大财宝埋在克里铿辟，可以使他大富，实则这也是谎话；我叫巴林羊和克瓦兔和我同走，杀了克瓦，把他的头颅给巴林带与国王；我抓住大兔的头，几乎杀死了他，亏得他拼死逃去了；乌鸦控告的事也是真的，我把他的妻夏比全个吞吃进去。还有一件事，我上次忘了对你说。我曾和狼同走，看见一匹红马，带了一头黑色的小驹，只有四个月大小，又好又肥。依赛格林饿得快死，恳求我到马那里，问她这个小驹卖不卖。

“于是他离了家。”



“我奔到马身边，问她这事。她说要有现钱才卖。

“我问她要卖多少钱。

“她说道：‘价钱写在我的后足上。如果你认得字，能够看得出，你便来看吧。’

“于是我猜出她的心思了，我说道：‘不，我不认得字。我也不想买你的孩子，依赛格林叫我到这里来，要问多少价钱。’

“马道：‘那么，让他自己到这里来，我要叫他得些知识。’

“我说道：‘好的。’于是奔到依赛格林那里，说道：‘叔叔，你要买这头小驹，她说价钱已写在她的足上。她要我去看，但我不认得一个字，我很自悔，因为我没有上过学校。叔叔，你要吃这头小驹么？如果你认得字，便可以去买了。’

“‘啊，侄儿，我很能够做这事。我懂得法文、拉丁文、英文及荷兰文。我到过渥斯福的学校。我要到她那里，看看这小驹的价钱。’他叫我等候他，他奔到马那里，问她是否要卖去这小驹。她道：‘价钱已写在我足上。’他道：‘让我看看。’她道：‘好的。’她举起她的足，正正踢在他的头上，马蹄铁是新换的，还钉有六只尖钉，他被踢，倒在地上，好像已死去。马领了小驹自去，依赛格林带着重伤躺着。他血流不止，呻吟着。于是我走近去，说道：‘依赛格林勋爵，好叔叔，你现在怎么样了？你把小驹肉吃够了么？为什么不给我一点？我代你传过命。你是否饭后便睡？我求你告诉我，马足上写的是什么？是散文还是韵文？我很想知道。我以为必是一首诗，因为我远远的已听见你在唱——你极博学，没有人读书比你读得更好些。’

“‘唉，列那，唉！’狼道，‘我求你不要再开玩笑了。我是这样的受伤，即铁石心肠的人也要可怜我！我看她的字，不料她踢了我一下，头上有六个伤。这样的文字我将永不想再读了。’‘好叔叔，你告诉我的是真话么？我很惊异，我以为你是现今生存的最大文人之一！现在我才晓得古语说得好，最好的文人，不必是最聪明的人。他们不聪明的原因，就在于研究知识及科学太多了，因此变成愚人了。’这就是我害得依赛格林几乎要受伤而死的一件事。

“好甥儿，现在我已把我所能记得住的罪过都说出来了。即使宫廷上有什么失败——我知道这是不会有的——我现在已是不怕，因我已刷清了罪过。我很喜欢要你助我忏悔。”

格令巴道：“你害的人太多了，但我可以为你赦罪。只是你把克瓦的头颅送到宫廷一件事，使国王气得太甚了，舅舅，这是太恶了。”

狐道：“什么，好甥儿！什么人经手拿蜜的，他只肯吮吮指头么？我有时觉得我应该爱上帝超乎一切，爱同胞如自己，所做的都要与上帝的法律相合。但你想，内心的理性与外来的欲望要如何的争斗呢？有时我想一定要洗脱诸罪，努力为善，但这不过是独居时的所想；隔了一瞬刻，世界与我相见了，我便觉我的路上有许多石块；又见了有钱的牧师、教士们的行动，于是我为欲望所胜了，世界上有无数的东西，我于是失去我的一切善念与计划了。我听见那里在唱，在吹笛，在笑，在游戏，一切是快乐；我听见那一班教士牧师们所说的，全与他们所想的、所做的不同。于是我也学说谎。谎话在国王的宫中最流行，爵主、贵妇、教士文人都在说谎。现在人们是不敢向爵主们说真话了。我必须也哄骗说谎，不然，便不能在门内坐着了。

“她举起她的足，正正踢在他的头上。”



“好甥儿，因此，现在的人必须到处说谎，哄骗，寻求每个人的弱点。但我所主张的不过说人们在小事情上必须要说些谎，因为永远说真话的人，他在现在的世界上是不能通行的。什么人常说真话，他的路上便要有许多阻碍。当必要时，人不妨说谎，待以后再补救。在所有杀害之中有怜悯在。最聪明的人有时也要为一个愚人。”

格令巴道：“舅舅，你的理由已在我所能懂的以外了。你还要求人忏悔赦罪。你知道一切世态人情，没有一个人可以立在你面前了。”

他们说着，已走进宫廷了。狐心里有些焦急。格令巴道：“舅舅，不要怕，镇定地对付一切！勇敢的人，机会能帮助他。”

狐道：“甥儿，你的话是对的。上帝谢你，你慰安了我！”

他向前走，眼光闪熠着四处地看，好像说：“你们要怎么样？我来了！”他看见有好些他的同类，及和他好的，站在那里。

狐走了进去，在国王面前跪下，开始说话。





28


“无所不知，无所不能的上帝保佑我的主，与我的后，愿上帝使他知道谁是对的，谁是错的。因为世界上有许多人，他们的内心是与外表绝不相同的。我愿上帝能公开地显示出每个人的罪过，而他们所有的罪状都能写在他们的前额上。我现在控诉那些恶贼，他们使我受了许多苦。但我愿你们，我的王与后，不要相信他们那些假造的谎话，你们是聪明正直的，我知道你们不会相信他们的。所以，我的爱主，我求你以你的智力研究合理合法的事。所有言动，都使每个人不受冤枉。我不再求别的了。他是有罪的，是说谎的，让他去受罚。人们在我离开朝廷之前，将十分明白我是什么样的人。我不会说好听的假话，只能心里有什么嘴里便说什么。”所有在宫殿上的人都沉默着，他们都震骇于狐的话说得如此的刚强。

国王道：“哈，列那，你真会哄骗人！但你的巧辩却不能帮助你。我已熟想过，你所做的事，在今天必须受绞刑。我不同你辩驳；我将减短你的痛苦。你对待兔及乌鸦的样子，就是你所谓爱我们的榜样了。你的谎话万不能延长你死的时候。‘一只水瓶汲了许久的水了，最后，它要碎成片片的。’我想，你的水瓶，骗了我们许久的，现在也要碎了。”

列那听了这些话，十分恐惧。他后悔来这里。然而他想，无论如何，他必须把讼事洗刷清楚。

他道：“我的主，我的王，请你听完我的话。虽然我被判定了死刑，然你应该听我的话。我以前曾为你划了许多策，做了许多事，在别人躲避着的时候，我都在你身边。如果现在恶兽们以假事控告我，我又不能得你的宽恕，那么我还能不辩诉么？旧的好处，应该记住。我见这里有许多我的同宗和朋友，他们心里都很忧愁，你，我的主，却不公平地要杀我。如果你杀了我，那么，你便要失掉你国内的最忠诚的仆人了。你们想想看，我的主，如果我觉得有罪，或有对不起人处，我怎么肯在所有我的仇人中投到法律之前呢？不，我王，不！就是为了全世界的黄金也不！因为我是自由的，无罪的。谢谢上帝，我知道自己是一点罪也没有的，所以我敢在光明中到这里来回答一切人对于我的控诉。但当格令巴把这些消息告诉我时，我很难过，不知怎么办好。恰好我的叔父米尔丁（Mertyne）猴遇到了我。他见我愁眉不解，便道：‘好侄儿，我觉得你不大舒服。有什么事，应该叫朋友们晓得。一个好朋友是一个大臂助，他可以设法救助你。’我道：‘好叔叔，我现在有大苦难，这是我所不应受的。这事起于一个朋友，大兔。他昨天清早到我这里来，那时我正坐在门外。他告诉我，他要到宫廷里去，他向我问好，我也问他好。

“‘于是他对我说道：“好列那，我是又倦又饿了，你有什么吃的么？”

“‘我道：“是的，有的——你来吧。”

“‘于是我给他一对圆面包，还涂上牛油。那天是礼拜三，是我不吃肉的日子。他吃完了，我的最少的孩子洛赛尔要把剩下的拿去。你知道，小孩子总是贪嘴的。不料大兔咬了他一口，他出血了，晕倒在地。我的大孩子列那定见了，跃过来把大兔的头捉住，如果我不赶快去救他，他几乎要被杀死了。我帮助他走开了，还把孩子打了一顿，不料大兔却到国王那里，诉说我要谋害他。看，叔叔，这就是他们说我有罪的一件事。

“‘此事之后，柯班特乌鸦来了，他悲鸣着飞来。我问他什么事。他说道：“唉，我的妻死了！那边有一只死兔，浑身都生了虫，她吃得太多了，虫把她的喉管弄断了。”

“‘我问他这事究竟怎样发生的。他不再说一句话，又飞开去了。现在他却说我咬了她。杀了她。我怎样能走近她？因为她是飞的，我是在地上走的。好叔叔，我是这样的被冤枉！我真不快活！’

“猴对我说道：‘侄儿，你到宫殿上去，求国王的原谅。’

“‘不，叔叔，不能去，因为主教要责罚我。这事是由依赛格林狼起的。他要脱离了他的教会，恢复自由的生活。他向我诉说，他的生活十分拘束，长久的素食，又要读书唱诗，他简直不能再住在那里了，如果他再住下去，他真要死了。我听了他的话，很可怜他，于是我帮助他出来。我现在很后悔，因为他倒竭力要陷害我，真是以怨报德。叔叔，因此我已到了智穷力尽之境。因为我必须到罗马去求赦罪，我去了，我的妻子恐要受害无穷。那些恶兽妒忌我的，恐将尽力地害他们。我如能到宫廷去，辩护了一切，便可保护他们了，但我又不敢去。我没有求赦罪，上帝会责备我。’

“猴道：‘不，不要怕。我可以帮助你，我知道到罗马去的路。我会替你去的。我还要带些钱去。祈祷者有了钱便会办得更妥。侄儿，不要愁！我明天就去，一直到罗马。你呢，到宫廷里去，立刻去。你所有的罪，我都替你承担了下来。你到了宫中的时候，可遇见我的妻绿克娜（Rukenawe），她的两个姊妹，和我的三个孩子，还有许多亲友。我的妻很高兴帮助人。如果你的事不得直，立刻叫人到罗马告诉我，我有法子想。所以，侄儿，你为我向国王要求，他对你存公道。我知道他不会拒绝你的。’

“我主，当我听见这些话，我笑了。我十分高兴地到这里来，告诉你所有的事。如果有人在这里能以充分的证据控告我，那么，有法律在；如果他不能如此，那么，可以定好日子，定好地方，我们可以相见于决斗场上。谁能以腕力得胜，让他得胜去。这个权利尚在，我不能因我而破坏。法律与公义不会冤枉人的。”

所有的禽兽，无论穷的富的，都沉默着，听狐这一席好像理直气壮的话。拉卜里大兔和柯班特乌鸦是十二分的害怕起来，他们不敢说话，都迅速地离开了宫殿。当他们俩到了远处的平原才说道：“神助这个恶贼作恶！他能隐藏他的虚谎，说来好像真的，如福音书一样的真，这些事只有我们知道，我们怎么会有证人呢？我们最好是忍耐着走开了，不要和他决斗。他的凶残，就是我们有五个也不能保护自己而要被他一个个杀死。”

依赛格林狼和白鲁因熊见他们两个离了宫殿，心里很忧愁。

国王说道：“如果有人要控告的，他可以站出来，我要听他：昨天到这里来的那么多——现在列那在这里了，他们却到哪里去了呢？”

狐道：“我的主，有许多控诉的人，而他们见了他们的仇人却沉默了，不控诉了。现在看拉卜里大兔和柯班特乌鸦，他们于我不在这里时向你控告我，现在呢，我来了，他们却逃走了，不敢再说一句话。如果人要相信了谎言的恶贼，好人是要受许多害——至于我，却不要紧。然而，我主，如果他们有你的命令向我求恕，任他们如何害我，我都可以为你之故原恕了他们。我不恨也不控告我的仇人们。但我把一切事放在上帝手上，他会报酬他们的。”

国王道：“列那，我想，你说你很难过。你以为事情已了了么？不，我必须说我的受害，这已足使你以生命报酬之了——当我把你的所有罪过都赦了时，你答应渡海去朝陵，我所以给你背囊和靴子，然而你此后却做了一件凶暴可羞的大罪。你叫巴林羊把背囊装了克瓦的头颅送还了我。你做的这事是否是一个大罪？你怎么敢给我这样的一个羞辱？把仆人的头颅送给一个主人，这是不是恶作剧？你再不能说没有这事了，因为巴林羊已经把这事的本末都说出来了，他把这信带给我们时，已得了那样的报酬，你也将有同样的，不然，公道要没有了！”

这时列那惊吓住了，他不知说什么话。他已智穷力尽了，很可怜地四面望着，见他的许多亲友都不说一句话。他整个脸都变白了，但没有一个人肯用一手或一足帮助他。

国王说道：“你这恶贼！你这谎徒！为什么不说话了？你现在成了哑子了么？”

狐十分恐惧地站在那里，重重地叹着气，什么人都能听见。但是狼与熊很喜欢。





29


母猴绿克娜，列那的婶母，是不大高兴了。她十分得宠于王后。亏得有她在这里，因为她极机敏，又会说话。她任到什么地方，每个人都喜欢她。

她说道：“我的主，当你审判时，不应该发怒，这是有损于你的尊严的。一个王坐在王廷，应有周密的思虑。我很懂得法律，懂得应用。西尼加（Seneca）说，一个王在任何事件上都应有正义与法律——他将已不会再责备那给予在正义与法律以上的他的保护的人。每个人在这里的都应自己反省，可怜列那。让每个人知道他自己——那是我的劝告。没有一个人能永久站得稳，他有时是要滑倒或跌落的。一生没有做过坏事或罪过的是神圣，是善人，不必再去纠正他了。当一个人做了错事，后来被动改过了，那是对的，应该做的，但常常做坏事而不改过，那才是恶魔的生活。请记住福音书的话：你要怜悯。还有一句话：不要裁判一个人，你也将不会被裁判。法里西人（Phurisees）带了一个通奸被捉住的妇人，要把她用石打死。他们问我们的主，他要说什么。他说道：‘你们当中如有无罪的人，请他抛第一块石块。’于是每个人都走开去了，只剩下她站在那里。这里也是如此。许多人都看见一根小稻草在别人的眼里，却不能看见在他自己眼里的一根木柱。许多人都会裁判别人，而他自己却是那一班人中的最坏的。虽然人常跌落，最后却站起来求他。上帝接受所有要求他怜悯的人。虽然人们知道某人做错了事，却不要责备他们，但让他们见到他们自己的过失，然后他们可以自己先改过，于是我的侄儿列那将不在那很坏的人之中了，因为他的祖与父在这个宫廷中比之依赛格林狼或白鲁因的全族都更得人主的爱与信用。这里有一个很不同的比较，我侄儿列那的机敏与他所得的光荣与名誉，及他们的会议：因为他们简直是不知道什么的。我想这个宫廷是倒置了。那些狡贼，骗子，会说谎的，都爬上去，为王与后所信用，至于好的，忠诚的，聪明的人都被抑下了。我不能见这种情形能站得长久。”

“母猴绿克娜是不大高兴了。”



于是国王说道：“夫人，如果他害你也如害别的人一样，你也要愁苦了。我恨他，是可怪的事么？你没有听见这里控告他杀人、做贼、奸谋的话吗？你那样的信任他么？你以为他是那样好，那样聪明么？那么，让他坐在祭坛上，崇拜他，如对一个圣者。但在全世界上却没有一个人能说出他什么好处来的，你可以说出许多来，但结局，你将找到都是不对的。他没有亲人，没有朋友肯来帮助他的。他应该受如此的待遇。我很奇怪你，我没有听见与他在一处的人会感谢过他或说过他好处，除了你现在。他常常以尾巴打击他们。”

母猴答道：“我的主，我是爱他的。我还记得他有一次在你面前办过一次事，你会当面谢过他。一个人爱人要有分寸，怨恨人也不可过度。我不要这时太赞美了，等以后再看吧。”

“两年以前，有一个人和一条蛇同到这个宫殿上来要求评判，你和你们的大臣们都狐疑不决。那蛇要穿过一座篱笆，但他被一个网捉住了，如没有人帮助他逃，他便要死在那里了。人走来了，蛇叫他，求人救他出网，救他一条命。人可怜他，说道：‘如果你答应不吃我，不害我，我可以救你出网。’蛇发了一个恶咒，说他决不会害他一丝一毫。于是人把网解了，放他出网。他们同走了好一会，蛇觉肚子饿了，他已好久没有吃东西了，他向人扑去，要吃了他。人恐慌地避开了，说道：‘你现在要杀我么？你忘了你曾立誓不伤害我么？’蛇答道：‘我可以告诉全世界，我这样做是对的。饥饿的需求，可以叫一个人不守他的誓言。’人道：‘如不能相饶，等我们遇到了别的人时，叫他裁判一下。’蛇答应了。他们向前走，遇到了乌鸦特赛林和他的孩子，他们听了人蛇的告诉。特赛林立刻判说，蛇可以吃了人。他和他的孩子都想乘此得一份吃吃。蛇对人道：‘现在怎样？你怎么想？我不是赢了么？’人道：‘一个强盗怎么能判断这事？他要得些利益。且只遇到他一个呢，至少必须两个或三个懂得法律正义的在一起评判才好。’蛇答应了，他们向前去，又遇到熊与狼，他们对他们告诉了这事。他们判决道，蛇可以吃了人。因为因饥饿而背誓是常有的事。人那时十分疑惧，蛇张开大嘴向着他，但人却很艰难地避开了。蛇道：‘这不够了么？已判决了两次。’人道：‘不，那是杀人贼强盗们下的判决。他们本是不守信誓的。但我要向我们的主，国王，那里去告诉，想你不至于反对。他下什么判语，我都听从，永不反对。’狼与熊都说可以，蛇也不反对。他们以为这事到了你那里，也将有与他们同样的判语。我想你能记得住。他们到宫殿上了。人战栗地告诉出他怎样救了蛇的命，蛇却要破誓吃他。蛇答道：‘我要吃他，因为救自己的命；为了救命，一个人可以不顾誓约。’我的主，那时你和你殿上大臣们都难判决。你见了他的愁苦，不欲他因行好事而被杀。在另一方面，又说因饥饿而欲救命，要求帮助。在殿上的人一个也不能说判语应该怎么下。我见他们站在这里，他们不知怎样解决这个事件。于是你叫了我的侄儿列那来，问他对这事的意见。那时，他在这殿上是比别人都亲信，你叫他下公平的判语。列那说道：‘我主，只听了他们的话不足为凭，因为口说常有假话。但如果我见了蛇与人未救他之前一样的受缚于网中，那么，我就可以下判语了。’于是你道：‘列那，你的话是对的。我们就照你的话办。’人和蛇都到原地方了。列那叫蛇照旧被缚在网中。你，我的主说道：‘列那，你现在怎么想？我们判决什么话？’于是列那说道：‘我的主，现在他们都照以前一样了。他们不胜不败。看，我主，我现在下判语了。如果人现在还信他以前的誓约，他可以把他放了去。但，如果他以为蛇可怕，怕他因饥饿要破约吃他，我便判道，人可以自由地走去，让蛇还留在那里，好像起首一样。我想这样是公正的判断。’唉，我主，这个判语你和你的大臣们都以为好，都赞美列那能使人自由离开了。如此，狐以智慧保住你的高贵的尊严与名望，如一个忠仆对他的主所做的。熊与狼能这样的给你挣光荣么？他们知道的是怎样吼叫偷盗，吃肥胖的肉，然后他们以正义与法律，判决那偷鸡窃雏的小贼的死刑，但是他们自己却偷着牛、马，他们无事地走去，还做着爵主。他们似乎比所罗门、亚里士多德还聪明，每个都很高傲，赞美着大事业与勇敢，但如果他们到那里办这件事，恐将第一个逃走了。唉，我主，他们和像他们一样的，都不聪明，只知毁坏城市、堡垒、土地及人民，他们都只求自己的利益。但列那和他的亲友却都想为他们的主争荣誉、争利益，聪明的参议在这里是比赞美与夸口更有益的。列那这样做，他却没有得到谢意。最后，人会明白谁是最好，做了最多的好事的。我主，你说他的亲友们都离去他，因他的奸诈而不与接近。我主，我可以设法使你知道列那的亲友们。有许多的他们，肯为列那之故给他以生命及财产，我自己就是一个。我是一个妇人。如果他需要，我将以我的生命及财产给他。我还有三个孩子，他们都勇敢强壮，我可以叫他们为他之故而冒险，我不欲见他灭亡。”





31


绿克娜夫人叫了他们来，说道：“来，我的好孩子们！到这里来，站在你的表兄弟列那那边。”于是她又说道：“所有你们是我的和列那的亲友，都上前来，让我们祈求国王给列那以公道。”

于是立刻来了许多的兽类，如松鼠，如麝鼠，如臭猫，如貂，如海狸和他的妻，如小马，如獴鼠，还有许多别的。水獭与他的妻及海狸原是狐的仇人，但他们不敢违绿克娜夫人的意旨，因为他们怕她。她是他们的同类中最有智谋，最为人所怕的。因为她之故，又来了别的二十余个站在列那那边。驴呀，蝙蝠呀，水鼠呀，还有许多，可以计算到四十个，他们都站到列那狐旁边。

绿克娜道：“吾主国王，请来看列那是否有朋友。我们都是你的百姓，为你可以牺牲了生命与财产。你虽然勇敢、有力、强壮，我的好意的情谊也不会伤了你。让列那狐想想你所反对他的那些事。如果他不能推脱，那么，你给他判罪。我们不更求别的。这个正当的请求，没有人会拒绝的。”

王后道：“我昨天已对他这样说了。但他那样的凶残愤怒，直不肯听我的话。”

豹也说道：“我的主，你可以听从他们的话，如果你直行己意，在你地位上是很不好的。常常听着两方面的话，然后跟着最好最聪明的意见谨慎地照着最公平的处置下判断。”

国王道：“这都是对的。但我听见克瓦的死和看见他的头颅，我不由得不大怒。我将听狐的话。如果他能答出并推脱了他的这个控案，我将高兴地让他无事走去。”

列那听了这些话很快活，想道：“上帝谢我的婶母——她竟使枯枝生花了！她竭力帮助了我。我现在可以有好运了，我放眼看去，将说出最美好的谎言，人所未闻的，把我自己引出这个危难之外。”





32


于是列那狐说道：“唉，你说什么？是克瓦的头颅么？巴林羊哪里去了？他来时带给你什么？我给他三件宝物，我要知道这三件东西的下落。一件是给我的主的，其他二件是给我的王后的。”

国王道：“巴林带给我的除了克瓦的头颅外，没有别的，所以我杀死了他。他自己说袋里的信是他写的。”

列那道：“唉！我的主，这是真的么？我真不幸！这些宝物失落了，真使我心碎了！我不要活了！我的妻知了这事，她将如何难过？我此生将永不得她的好感了！她要忧死了！”

母猴道：“列那，好侄儿，你干着急有什么用？不去管它，先告诉我们这些宝物是怎么样的，也许我们能去设法把它们寻回。”

列那道：“不，婶母，你的话使我的心宽了些。唉！唉！我最相信的人却哄骗了我。我愿走遍全世界，冒着生命的危险以寻求这些宝物。”于是他用悲哽的语调对大家说道：“你们请听，我将告诉你们这些宝物的功用，然后你们可以知道我的损失如何的大了。第一件是一只纯金的戒指，里面有三个希伯莱字，我不认识，请犹太人阿皮里安（Abrion）告诉我，他说，这些是从天上乐园带下的三个名字，戴了它，不怕雷打，不怕巫术，不怕被人引诱为恶，虽然躺在露天三个冬夜也不会受冷，不管风雪如何大。戒指的面上有一粒三色的宝石，一部分是像红水晶似的，发出如火焰的光亮，人在夜行，可不再需灯火，它的光照得如同中午；一部分是白色，人的眼上身上有什么疾痛，拿石一擦痛处，立刻痊愈，内部有病，如伤食、肠痛等，只要把这石放在水中，人一饮此水，也立刻会好。唉！失了此宝如何可惜！第三部分是如草一般的绿，带着紫色斑点，戴着此石的，永不会受仇人的害，每战必胜，即仇人也会变了爱他，赤身与一百个战士打，也可以得胜，但戴此石者必须为一个高贵无比的人，不然便不生效力。我想此宝物如此的名贵，自己不配用，所以献给我主，他是现在的最高贵的人。

“这戒指是我在我父亲宝库中得到的，在这库中还得到一面镜，一把梳，我妻常用它们。因此两物也是可珍贵的宝物，所以我把它们献给王后，她对我十分的慈爱。这把梳是生息于地上乐园与大印度间的一只高贵动物名潘西拉（Panthera）的骨所做的。这兽极好看，他的香气可以医病，别的兽都跟在他后边，闻了他的香便一切病都没有了。他虽死了，香味仍存骨上，这骨很轻，但不会碎损，不会被水火所灭。谁闻了那香味，便成了世上最可爱的人，永不会有病，心上也极快活。这梳如银一般的光滑，梳齿小而狭，边上有空处，雕了许多人物，雕的是巴里斯和三女神的故事。三女神叫巴里斯判断谁是最美的，便可得那个金苹果。巴里斯这时是一个牧人，在特洛哀城外牧羊。女神约诺许他为最富的人，巴拉丝许他为最聪明有力的王，委娜斯许他得一个最美的妇人。巴里斯把金苹果给了委娜斯。这美妇人就是希腊的一个王的妻海仑。巴里斯后来以委娜斯之助，拐走了海仑，他们俩生活得快乐。这些都雕在梳上。

“现在请你们听听镜的事。这面镜可以使人见一里以内愿见的人物及一切事。见了镜，人也可以医愈了好些病。它的架木，也是极著名的，又坚又美，在镜边上现着六个故事，每个故事配着一种颜色，在故事之下有刻的字句。第一个故事是一匹马见一只鹿飞快地跑着，很不高兴，便对一个牧人道：‘你捉了前面的鹿，可以得许多利益。’人骑上马去追，但鹿跑得极快，追不上，马疲倦了，说道：‘请你下来去吧，让我休息。’牧人道：‘我捉到你了，你不能逃去。’马妒忌了别人，他自己却陷入网中！想害人的却自己受了害。第二个故事是一头驴与一只猎犬，他们俱与一个富人同住。那富人爱这猎犬，他常与主人游戏，立起来，舐他主人。驴见了，心里很羡慕，他也想得到主人的爱，便也立了起来，把前足放在主人肩上，牙齿露着，想舐主人。主人大叫道：‘救命呀，救命呀，驴要杀我了！’仆人来了，把驴打得半死。有许多人羡慕别人的幸福而去学样的，也要与驴同样的受苦。第三个故事是说特保猫和我父亲在一处，他们誓相帮助，不相分离，有得必均分。有一天，他们见一群猎者带了许多狗走来，他们拼命地逃避。父亲道：‘特保，怎么办呢？猎人追来了。但我有千百方法，可以逃避猎者，不要怕。’特保叹气，道：‘列那，我只知道一个方法。’说时，他爬上树顶，让我父亲一人受苦。猎人叫道：‘狐！捉！打！’特保讥嘲地说道：‘你施出你的千百方法来啊！’我父亲尽力地逃，几乎被捉，亏得路中有一旧洞，始得逃命。不受信约的人，现在是有多少呀！第四个故事是说狼有一次寻到一匹死马，肉都已被吃了。他嚼着骨头，因饿极，有一根骨哽在他喉里。他极痛苦，求医也无效。后来他见了长颈的鹭鸶，求他帮助，说可以尽力报酬他。鹭鸶把头放入狼嘴里，把骨取出。鹭鸶要求他所许的报酬，但狼道：‘你的头放在狼嘴里而没有受害，已是侥幸极了，应该是我向你要报酬！’

“第二个故事。”



“这便是现在的恶人报酬帮他恩人的样子了。还有许多我不能记住了。这些宝物，我不配有，所以送给我的王与后。我把镜退来时，两个孩子还哭了一场。唉！我不知克瓦兔怎么死的？我把背囊盛了宝物给他带来的！他们是我的最好朋友，除了羊与兔我找不到别人可托带这些东西了。唉！我欲知谁是杀克瓦的，我要走遍天涯去寻他！也许他就是在这一群中。恶人会把自己混在好人中，知道怎样藏盖他的罪恶。但我最奇怪我王说我与我父亲对他没有好处。有许多事，他虽一件件忘了，我是记得的。我的主，你不记得你两岁时，你父王生了一场大病，我父亲正从医校中出来，便设法把他医好了。他为国王所信任，还赐了一个玫瑰花圈。但现在一切都颠倒了。旧的好事被忘了，恶徒却占据着高位。就是我自己，对你也有微功。你也许还记得。请你主持公道，不要听信没有证据的话。”

国王道：“列那，你说的近情理。我对于克瓦的死，除了巴林羊把他的头颅放在背囊里带来以外，不知别的事。现在我让你无事走去，因为我没有证据。”

列那道：“我的主，上帝谢你！他的死使我的心几乎碎而为二，我真难过。”

“第四个故事。”



“你父王生了一场大病。”



大部分在宫殿上的兽，听了列那叙述三件宝物的话，都以为是真的事。他们见他失了这些东西，见他的焦急的样子，都代他发愁。王与后也可怜他，叫他不要过于难过，但可以尽力去找。他的形容尽致的宝物，已使他们想要占有了。他说，这些宝物是送给他们的，所以他们虽不会得到，却谢了他，要他帮着去寻找。

狐很明白他们的意思，他道：“上帝谢你们！我的王与后，你们那样安慰我。我将日夜奔跑，祈求，走遍天下，以求这些宝物。我的主，我求你，如果这些东西在我所不能以智或力或恳求取得的地方，我求你帮助我，因为那些本来是你的。并且你也应该惩戒那偷盗杀人的贼。”

国王道：“你知道了他们在哪里，我决不坐视。我将常常预备帮助你。”

“呵，好的王，这简直好得太过分了！”

现在狐已把事办得很好，他已把国王放在掌上玩弄了。他起初想不到结果这样好，他造了许多的谎，可以使他自由地任意地走去不再受人控诉。但依赛格林却对他是不高兴的，说道：“唉，高贵的王，你竟这样的幼推，会相信这个可恶的狡贼，竟会如此的被他的谎话所哄骗么？真的，我久已不相信他了——他是杀人贼、奸臣，他当你的面讥笑你。我将告诉他别的故事。我很喜欢现在看见他在这里。在他离开我之前，一切他的谎话都无所用。”





33


他又说道：“我的主，我求你留意。这个谎言贼有一次又曾不忠实地骗辱了我的妻。事情是如此：在一个冬天，他与我的妻同行过一片大水。他告诉我的妻说，他可以教她用尾巴来钓鱼，并说，她如把尾巴挂在水下多时，便可以有许多鱼附在尾巴上，这些鱼，他们四个都吃不了。这个傻子，我的妻，居然以为他说的是真话。她在泥泽中走着，到了水的深处，狐叫她把尾巴放下，鱼自然会来的。她把尾巴放下了许久，后来竟坚固地冻结在冰上了，她不能把它拔起，当他见了便跃在她身上。唉！我不忍说出这恶贼如何污辱她的情形，她不能抵抗他，她深陷在泥泽中。这事，他万不能否认，因为这是我亲眼见到的。当时，我正在河岸上走着，见他正伏在我妻的背上，她咆哮地叫着。唉，那时我心上是如何的痛苦呀！我已失了神智，高声大叫道：‘列那，你在那里做什么？’当他见我走得这样近，便跳了下来，走开去了。我悲愁地向她走去，在泥中水中走着，然后去打破了冰块，她受了许多苦才把尾巴从冰上拔出，且还留一段尾巴在冰上。但我们的苦还未受完呢。她咆哮得极响，震动了的乡村中的人都执着种种木棒武器出来了，他们怒声叫道：‘杀死！杀死！打死他们！’我生平没有这样的恐惧过，我们几乎失去了性命。我们竭力奔逃得浑身出汗。一个人用长枪刺伤了我们，他又强壮又跑得快。如果不是天色晚了，我们一定会被杀了。后来，我们跑到了丛林的地方，躲在林中，他们因为夜晚了，才不敢再追，各各回家了。我的主，这种的谋害，奸计，你必须为我们主持公道！”

列那答道：“如果这些话是真的，那么我的名誉太污下了。上帝禁止这事成为真的！我叫她到一个地方去捉鱼，这是真的，我指给她一条好路，叫她不要走入泥中。但她听见了有鱼时，便没命地跑，并不由正路走，却到了冰上，因此被冻住了。如果她不贪心，一定可以得了好些鱼，且不会受苦的。这是常有的事，一个人要得到一切，反而失去了一切。过度的贪心，绝没有好结果。当时，我见她被冰冻住了，便去帮助她出来，但枉自费尽了力，因为她身子太重，我不能拖得动。那时恰好依赛格林来了，他由上望下，眼睛花了，其实我决无别的举动。他叫着骂着我，我只好走开了，让他去骂。于是他自己去把他的妻救出，他们一跳一跳地去取暖去了。这就是一切经过的事，没有一句谎话。如果你还有什么疑惑，给我八日的期限，我可以给你许多充足的证据看。狼他自己是一个欺蔑妇人的、凶恶的坏汉子，却反说着我。现在试问他的妻，究竟他的话对不对。如果她说真话，一定会和我说的一样。”

于是狼的妻说道：“唉，恶列那，没有人敢和你接近——你的谎话说得太像了，但结果你将要受罚的！有一次，你使我入了一口井，几乎使我丧了命。井口上有两只篮子，挂在绳的两端，绳则挂在一个滑车上，如果一只篮下去了一只篮便升上来，你那时坐在一只篮上，落于井中，心里十分惊慌。我恰好走近了井边，闻见你的叹声，便问你为何到井里去。你说那里有许多好鱼吃，你的肚子都吃得饱胀了。我说道：‘告诉我怎么能下去。’于是你说道：‘婶母，你跳在挂在那里的篮中，便可以立刻到我这里来了。’我依你的话跳下篮子，我沉了下去，你却升上来了！我于是生气起来。你却说道：‘一个升起来，一个沉下去，那正是世界上的常道！’于是你跳出井口，自己走去了——我独自坐在井中，坐了一个整天，愁苦着，饥饿着，寒冷着，在我出井之前，还受了许多下的打。”

狐道：“婶母，你挨了打，却救了我，但我却给你一个好教训，下一次你万不能过于仓促地相信别人，不管他是朋友还是亲戚，因为每个人都是求他自己的利益的。如果有生命危险而不肯骗人以自救，那么，他一定是个傻子。”





34


母狼道：“我的主，你听听他的话！”狼道：“他还有许多次使我受了危害。他有一次向他的婶母，母猴，卖了我。我受了大惊惶，几乎全只耳朵都落在那里了。现在叫狐自己把这事告诉出来，看他如何说谎，我先说，他又要以巧辩来掩饰了。”

狐道：“好的，我说实话，一句也不多说。他到了林中，告诉我说他十分饥饿，我很可怜他。我说：‘我也觉得饿呢。’于是我们一同走了半天，得不到什么吃的东西。于是他呻吟着，说不能再走了。这时，我见一个大洞，在丛林的密处，我听见洞中有瑟瑟的声音，我不知有什么东西在洞中。于是我说道：‘到那里去看看，也许有什么可以吃的，我知道那里有东西。’他说道：‘非我先知道洞内有什么，即你给我二十镑，我也不爬进去，我想，洞内或有什么可怕的东西。我在那株树下等你，你先爬进去。但须立刻出来，告诉我洞中有什么。你比我机警，绝没有危险的。’看，我的主，这个恶汉，他使我先去挡危险，他自己又大又壮，却平安地在旁观着。我只得勇敢地走进去。洞内黑暗而阔大，我走了一段路，到了洞的那边，见在光明中一个大猴躺在那里，两只大眼睛如火焰似的。她的大嘴中长着长牙，足上手上都是尖爪。我没有见过这样可怕的兽。在她身边，躺着三个小猴，也和他们的母亲一个模样。当他们见了我时，都不动地望着我。我害怕起来，后悔不该进来，但我却想道：‘已经进来了，必须设法平安地出去。’我见她比依赛格林狼还大，她的孩子们比我还大。我只好低头下心地说好话，我说道：‘婶母，上帝给你好日子，你的好孩子们都好！他们真是美，真是可爱！每个都是王子一样。我一听见你生产了，所以立刻跑来看你。’她说道：‘列那，欢迎你来！你居然会找到这里来，谢谢你！你必须把你的聪明教给我孩子们一点，使他们知道应做的事。’呵，我听了她的话真是快活！这值得我开头叫她为婶母；实则我与她毫无亲戚关系，我的真婶母乃是前面站着的绿克娜夫人。当时，我说道：‘婶母，我极愿意把所知的都教给他们。’说完了话，我便动身要走。她说道：‘吃完了饭再走吧。’于是她站起来，领我到别一洞里，那里有许多的吃的东西。我吃饱了之后，她还把一块肉给我带回家去。我由原路出来，见依赛格林躺在那里呻吟。他说道：‘好侄儿，有吃的东西没有？我要饿死了！’于是我很可怜他，把带来的肉给他，因此救了他的命。那时他向我千恩万谢，谁知他现在倒反对我了呢？他很快地把肉吃下了，然后他问道：‘列那，你在洞里得到了什么？我现在比以前更饿得慌！我的齿现在格外尖利的要咬东西。’我道：‘叔叔，你进洞去，可以得到好多东西吃。洞里住的是我的婶母和她的孩子们。如果你能藏了真情，编了一片大谎，你便可以得到许多吃的。但你如果说了真心话，你将要受苦的。’我的主，我不是如此的警告过他么？谁知粗鲁的兽类，全不懂得机警。他一见了他们，便惊得叫起来道：‘唉，简直是从地狱出来的，真可怕！我怕得根根毛都耸竖起来了。’她说道：‘依赛格林先生，他们是我的孩子们。他们生得好丑，与你何关？刚才来的一位就比你好得多，聪明得多了。谁叫你来的？’他道：‘夫人，我要吃东西。’她道：‘这里没有东西。’他道：‘这里有不少。’于是他直向贮物的洞中走去。我的婶母便带了孩子们奔到他面前，用长爪把他抓得血从眼中流下。我听见他痛楚地咆哮着，又见他飞奔出洞。他浑身都是伤，一只耳朵几乎全失去了。他向我诉苦，我问他说了谎没有。他道：‘我照直地说。’我道：‘不，叔叔，你不应该这样说，你应该说她的孩子们如何的好看，如何的可爱。你照直说，挨打是活该。有的时候，你要晓得，谎话要比真话好。他们比我们聪明的比我们强壮的都是如此地做的。’现在我主请你问他，事情是不是如此。”





35


狼道：“你真是恶极之贼，你笑我，嘲骂我，说着谎话，我都暂且忍耐下去。你说，我饿得快死，是你救了我，那完全是说谎。你给我的不过一根骨头——你已经把肉都啃干净了。你笑我，说我饿极了，你实在太污辱我了！你说了许多谎话，叫国王捆缚了我，又污辱我妻子，又暗害我许多次，我已忍了许久许久了，但现在你不能逃开我了。我不能有什么充分的证据，但我在这里，在我王、我后以及大众之前，宣言你是一个虚伪的奸臣，一个杀人犯！我将与你在决斗场上见，一个比一个，以死为止！现在，我把手套掷给你了，拾了它去，我将为公道而战，就死也愿意。”

“他飞奔出洞，浑身都是伤。”



列那狐想道：“我怎么能与他决斗呢？我们是不相等的。我不能抵挡这个强有力的贼，所有我的努力，现在都完了！”





36


然而狐又转念道：“我还有些好机会。他的前足的爪已经没有了，他的足还痛楚着，因我之故，把他的靴脱下，现在创伤还未好呢。他比前是衰弱些了。”

于是狐说道：“谁说我是一个奸臣、一个杀人犯的，我说他是说谎。依赛格林，特别是你！你要与我决斗，这是我所希望的。我要以力自卫，辩明你说的话是假的。”

国王于是允许了他们二人决斗，叫他们各指定两个证人。于是熊与猫做了狼的证人；格令巴与皮特洛做了狐的证人。





37


母猴对狐说道：“列那侄儿，你在决斗时必须留心，要冷静机警。你的叔叔，告诉过我一首祷词，在战前唱祷极有效力。他说，谁要虔诚地念着祷词，那日出战，必定不会为人所败。明早，我要为你祷念——那么，你一定可以胜了狼了。决斗总比绞死好。”

狐道：“我谢你，亲爱的婶母。这次决斗，我是对的——所以我希望能有公道的结局。”

这一夜，所有他的亲友都来陪伴他。

母猴绿克娜夫人常常为他的福利着想。她把他的毛发弄得光顺；她用橄榄油擦他的全身；如此，他的身体是又光又滑，狼不能握住了他，他的身体真是胖，直成了圆圆的。

她对他道：“好侄儿，你现在可以多喝些，决斗时格外有精神。时候到了时，你可以用你松散的尾巴打他，如果你能打到他的眼睛，他便看不清东西，更容易赢他了。但以后，你的尾巴须常夹在两腿间，使他不至捉住你；你的两只耳朵也须平贴在头上，使他不会握住；处处须自己留心。开头你逃避他的打击，叫他跳着跑着追你；你要跑到多灰土的地方用足把灰土拨飞起来，使它飞到他眼中，益发使他看不清东西。当他去擦眼时，你却窥便尽力打他；常常用你的尾巴打他的脸。引他追随你后面，要使他疲倦。他的足还创痛着，且他虽然强大有力，却丝毫没有心计。侄儿，我的话就是如此。技巧胜过强力。所以你自己留心，机警防护自己，你和我们便都可以得最后的荣誉了。如果你失败了，我真要忧愁不已！侄儿，现在你放宽了心去休息，我们会叫醒你的。”

狐道：“婶母，我现在快活了，上帝谢你！你如此看待我，我下次真不配再受你的了。”

于是他去躺在一株树下的绿草上睡了，一直睡到太阳升上来时才醒来。于是水獭来叫醒他，给他一只胖小鸭吃，说道：“好兄弟，我昨夜跳入水中许多次，才得到这只胖小鸭。这是从一个养鸭人那里捉来的，拿去吃了吧。”

列那道：“这真是好赐品。如果我拒绝了，我必是一个傻子了。我谢谢你。兄弟，你还记念住我。如果我活着，我将报答你。”

狐吃了鸭，没有汤也没有面包。这鸭很好吃，他还喝了四大口水。然后他到决斗场上去，所有爱他的，全都跟了他去。





38


国王见列那那样的浑身光滑，对他说道：“呵，列那，你真会自己修饰！”

国王觉得奇怪，脸色很难看。

但狐默默无言，只跪在地上，向国王及王后行了礼，便起身进了决斗场。

狼已经在那里了，正在说着许多骄傲的话。决斗场的守者是豹和大野猫，他们带了书来，在书上，狼说，狐是一个奸臣，一个杀人犯，没有一个比他更坏的，并说他将以体力证明他。列那狐说，狼是一个虚伪的狡者，一个恶贼，说着谎话，他将以体力证明他。

“她用橄榄油擦他的全身。”



当这事完了时，守场官叫他们开始决斗。一切旁观者都退到场外，只有母猴绿克娜夫人还留在那里，她立在狐身边，嘱咐他记住她昨夜所说的话。她说道：“好好地留心。当你七岁时，你已经会在夜间不带灯，也没有月的去得到东西了。在人民中，你素以聪明才著名。专心尽力去赢得这个荣誉，大家都可以有光荣。”

他答道：“我挚爱的婶母，我都知道。我将竭力做去，依着你的忠言。我希望如此做去，我的全族都可以有光荣，我的仇人们将要受辱。”

她说道：“上帝把它给你！”





39


于是她也退出场外，只留他们两个在场上。狼暴怒地向狐冲过去，伸开两只前足，要把狐捉住。但狐轻轻地跳开了，因为他的足比狼轻便。狼追在狐后，去捕捉他。他们的朋友们都在场外看着。狐窥便用毛松松的尾巴打他的脸，狼的眼一时张不开，他便停下来擦擦他的眼。列那得到了机会，立在顺风处，用足拨扬起灰土，它们都飞入狼眼中，狼看不见东西了，只得立着设法擦掉眼中的灰土。

于是列那来了，尽力用牙齿在他头上咬了三个伤痕，且说道：“什么事，狼勋爵？有人打你么？你偷了许多只羊，杀了许多好动物，现在更以欺诈手段和我决斗，我如今要报仇了，我是被选来惩罚你的旧罪的。上帝不能再忍耐你的贪欲与狡猾了。你不能再想活了，地狱正是你的乐土。你的生命现在在我掌握中，但你如果跪下求我原谅，对大众宣言你是输了，那么你虽罪大恶极，我也将宽恕了你。因为我的良心，叫我不喜欢杀什么人。”

“只得立着设法擦掉眼中的灰土。”



依赛格林听了这些讥嘲侮蔑的话，气得一句话都说不出，心中愤怒极了，列那咬他的创处又流血而痛楚。他想，最好是报仇，于是他暴怒地举足重重地打在狐的头上，使狐跌倒在地上了，于是狼向狐走去，想捉住他。但狐是轻便而机诈的，立刻站起身来，凶暴地迎了上去。于是一场恶斗开始了。这场恶斗经过了许久工夫。狼连连地向狐扑去，几乎捉住了他，但他的毛十分光滑，又逃避开去了。呵，狐是如何机警而敏捷呀！许多次，狼以为一定可以捉住他了，不料他却在狼双腿之间及腹下钻了过来。转过身来，又用尾巴打在狼的眼上。依赛格林以为他要瞎了。他又常常窥便立在顺风处，用足拨扬起灰土，使狼的眼中飞进了不少泥沙。依赛格林觉得他已处于不利的地位，但他的气力还远胜于狐。列那常常窥便打了他许多下。狼也常常打到狐。他们各出死力相角。我真愿意见见这种争斗：一个是机警，一个是强有力；一个以力量来打仗，一个却以智巧来打仗。

狼见狐与他相持了这许久，心里动了气，如果他前足没有取下靴子，狐一定不会与他相持很久，可惜他现在足很痛苦，不能跑得快。后来，他自己想道：“我须使这场决斗结束了。这个恶贼能与我相持多久呢？我是雄伟的——如果我压在他身上，也可把他压死了。我宽饶了他这许久，真是大可耻，人们一定会讥笑我，用指指点我，羞辱我，因为看样子，我还在劣下的一面。我受了好些伤；我流着血；他拨起许多灰土在我眼中，如果我再与他争持几时，我的眼要不能见物了，我要窥一个机会打倒他。”

于是狼用足打在列那的头上，把他打倒在地上，于他没有翻身立起之前，捉住他的腿，压在他身上，似乎要压死他。于是狐开始害怕了。他的朋友们见他躺在下面，也都害怕起来。所有依赛格林的朋友们却都喜欢着。狐脸朝天地躺着，用足爪尽力地防卫自己，打了狼许多下，狼不敢用足打他，但他的牙齿露出，将要去咬他。狐见狼要咬他，十分的怕，用前爪尽力抓了狼的头脸，他眉上的皮被抓下一块，一只眼睛也被挖得挂出眶外。狼异常痛楚，咆哮着，惨叫着，血如川流似的淌下来。





40


狼揩擦他的眼，狐见了很高兴。狼擦眼时，狐却乘势挣扎，跳起身来。狼赶快地去捉他的足，在他未逃去之前，不管自己流着血，还把他紧捉住。狼恼怒极了，忘了一切的痛苦，把狐直压在身下。

于是狼对狐道：“现在你声明自己是失败了，不然，我一定要杀你了。你现在什么伎俩都无用了。你不能逃开我了。你以前污辱我，谋害我许多次，现在你还使我失了一只眼，且使我浑身都是伤。”

列那听了这话，他迟疑了许久，不知是承认失败好呢，还是被杀死好呢。他知道二者之中必须取一，但不久，他便决定要说的话，于是说了许多好话：“叔叔，我很快乐地把我的财宝都给你，我成了你的人。我要为你到圣陵去，代你祷告。我永久是你的奴隶，我的亲属们也都给你差遣。那时，你将成了主上之主。什么人还敢反抗你呢？此后，我无论捉到了鸡鸭或得到了鱼肉，一定先给你拣选，还要先给你的妻及你的孩子们。我永远给你差遣，你可以永不会再有危害了。你有力，我机智，我们二人在一处，一个出主意，一个去做，再不会有错失的事发生了，且我们的种族相近，不应互相仇视。如果我昨天能避开，我一定不会和你决斗的。但那是你先要决斗的，于是我不得不去做这件不欲做的事。且在这次决斗中，我对你很客气，我没有用全力对付你，因为侄儿应该让叔叔的。好叔叔，你看我总是避了你，且我可以重伤你而我不肯。你的眼坏了，唉！我心里很难过！好叔叔，我愿意我的眼瞎了，不是你的！然而你此后也可以有大利益，因为你以后睡时只要闭上一只，别的人却须闭上两只！我的妻子，我的同类，都要跪在国王之前，你之前，以及你的人之前，恳求你赦了你的侄列那的命。我也将声明以前种种的不对，以及种种说你的话都是谎话。我给你这种光荣是比之给国王的还大些，所以我求你以后可以快快活活了。我知道，你如果杀我，立刻可以杀。但你如果杀了我，你得到了什么？你此后必须远离开我的朋友和亲戚了。聪明的人，愤怒要有限量，做事不可过急，且会仔细打算以后的事。许多愚人常因做事过快而后悔，但那时已经太迟了。好叔叔，我知道你是聪明人，会打算的。荣誉、赞美、安息、平和，以及许多预备帮助你的朋友，是比之羞辱、损害、不安，以及许多以后欲乘机复仇的仇人们好的。并且，已经打胜了人，又去杀他，是没有什么名誉的。这是大耻辱，并不是因为我的性命——我死了，不值得什么。”

依赛格林道：“呵，贼，你还要以美言逃了我，以为我可以听你的话！虽然你答应把全世界的好黄金都给了我，我也不能放了你，你所说的全都是谎话。你想以此欺骗我么？我早已知道你了，我不是容易捉的鸟。我很知道无危险的好谷或罗网中的谷。唉！如果我这样让你逃去了，你将如何的讥笑我呀！你可以把这一套话说给不知道你的去听，但对我说，你的甘言巧语却失掉效力了，因为我太明白你的谎话了。你骗我的次数太多，我现在必要留心你了。你这狡贼，你说你这次决斗，宽赦我好几次！看着我！我的一只眼睛不是被你挖出来么？我的头上还被你伤了二十次。你简直紧紧地逼我，不让我呼吸一下。我如果赦了你，真要算是一个傻子了。你羞辱我及我挚爱的妻多少次，我一想起来，我的心便充满了恨怒，想要复仇。”

当依赛格林说话时，狐已在想自救之法。他暗中挣扎，脱出一只手来，把狼的睾丸紧紧地捏住。狼痛楚极了，大叫起来，狐乘势又脱出一只手来。





41


这个痛楚比他眼睛被挖出时还甚，他躺在地上，呻吟不绝。于是列那用尽浑身的力量，跳在他身上，捉住他双腿，拖他在场中走，使大家都看见，还时时尽力地打他。所有的依赛格林的朋友都悲苦不堪，哭着到国王面前，求他下令中止这场决斗，把这事由他判决。

“让我的朋友们都过来。”



国王答应了。于是场官，豹及野猫，对狐及狼说道：“我们的主对你们说，这场决斗停止了。他要这事由他判决。如果你们之中有一个被杀了，两方面都是有大耻的。”

于是，他们对狐道：“全体的兽类，见到这场决斗的都称赞你。”

狐道：“我谢谢他们。我听国王的命令，我只求胜了这场决斗，更不求什么别的。让我的朋友们都过来！我要问他们我以后要做的事。”

他们于是都来了，格令巴夫妇，绿克娜夫人及她的两个姊姊，还有许多别的，有二十个以上，列那如果输了他们便不会来的。他得了大光荣、大名誉。以前向国王控告过他的，现在也认为他的亲友了。他们对他都恭敬亲热。现在的世界也是如此！谁有钱有势，便有许多亲友来赶热闹；谁若穷苦无权，朋友们亲戚们便都要避他了。

于是他们举行了大宴乐。鼓乐喧阗，非常热闹。

他们都说道：“好侄儿，谢谢上帝，你竟赢了！当我们见你躺在下面时，真是十分害怕。”

列那狐和气地谢了他们，十分快活地和他们周旋。于是他问他们是否要把这事交给国王判决。

格令巴夫人道：“是的，勇敢些，你可以把名誉交在他手中，信任他。”

于是他们全体同监场官一起到国王那里去。列那狐在他们前面走，鼓乐悠扬地奏着。狐跪在国王之前。

国王叫他立了起来，对他说道：“列那，你现在可以快活了。我赦了你，让你自由地走到哪里都可以。你们之间的争端，交给我办，我要与贵人们商议，等到依赛格林痊愈后，我叫人去找你来，那时再凭公道宣判。”





42


狐道：“我高贵亲爱的主，我十分满意。但当初我到你宫中来时，有许多恶人嫉妒我，我却永不曾害过他们。他们都帮了我的仇人反对我，都要除去了我以为快，因为他们想依赛格林在你那里比我的地位高得多。他们不知别的了。

“我的主，这正如我有一次在一个爵士地方所看见的一大群猎犬。他们聚在那里，等人来带东西给他们吃。后来，他们见一只猎犬由厨房中跑出来，衔着一块肥牛排，那是偷来的，他跑得极快，但厨子在他未逃远之前，把一大碗滚热的水，泼倒在他背上，使他的毛都落了。但他终于逃出，衔着偷到的东西。

“当他的朋友们及别的猎犬见了他衔了这块肥牛排出来，他们都对他说道：‘呵，厨子与你的交情真好，他给你这么好的一块牛排，上面有那么多的肉！’

“那只猎犬说道：‘你们不知道什么事。你们赞美我的前面，因为衔了肉。但你们没有见到我的背后。请留心，请看我的背上，然后你们就可以知道我是怎么取得这块肉的了。’

“当他们见了他背上被滚水烫脱的毛与烂肉，他们全都叫了起来，害怕那开水，他们不同他做朋友了。飞逃了开去，留他一个在那里。

“我的主，你看，这正是这一班恶贼的情形。当他们为爵主时，为所欲为，有力有威，抢夺百姓们的，吃食百姓们的，正如一群饥饿的猎犬一样，这正是他们衔了肥肉在口之时。没有人不赞颂他们，不恭敬他们。有的还助他们为暴，从中染指。唉，我的主！他们简直没有看见他们的背后，没有看见他们最后的结局。他们受了大羞大辱，由高跌到低，然后他们的暴行才为大家所知，没有人可怜他们，没有人理会他们。至于他们的朋友呢，就如那一班猎犬们，一见他受害了，便一个个地离开了，留下他一个在忧苦中。

“我的主，我求你记住我这个比喻。这些日子，这种恶人真多——他们所做的坏事，比之猎犬偷骨还甚些——他们压迫可怜的人民卖去他们的自由与特权，只为了一己的利益。愿上帝给他们以羞辱，且立刻把他们都除去了，不管他们是谁！

“谢谢上帝，我及我的亲属却都还光明，不做恶事。我亲爱的主，我全心全意爱你比一切爵主都甚，谁都不能离间我，我永远地听你的命令。”





43


国王道：“列那，你是服从我的人之一，我望你常能如此。我还愿意迟早使你做我的顾问，做我的法官。你须注意，不要再生事害人了。我把一切你的权力都给还了你，如以前一样。你的智力须用在好处，我的宫廷上将不能没有你的咨议与商量，因为这里没有一个有你那么聪明，那么能设法矫正错误。你须依你的话，努力走正路，且忠于我。我此后将听你的话做事。如果有谁欺负你，他便不想活了，我会为你复仇的。你将代我巡察全国，代我宣布德意。我给你这个差事，你须好好地奉职。”

“他病得完全失了知觉。”



所有列那的亲友都深深地感谢国王。国王道：“我比你们所想的给得更多了。”

绿克娜夫人道：“感谢我的主。他是忠实的，如果他不然，他便不是我们的亲属了，我们将永不认他了。”

列那狐用美辞表达谢意，他说道：“亲爱的主，我不配受你这么大的恩典。我想此后当终生尽忠于你，要为你的最忠恳的侍臣，以全部的智力为你谋光荣。”

于是他和朋友们拜谢了国王。

现在看依赛格林狼什么样子。白鲁因熊、特保猫以及他的妻和孩子们，还有别的亲属，把他抬出决斗场外，放在稻草上，又用草盖在他身上使他温暖，然后看察他的伤处，全身共有二十五处创痕。外科医生来了，把创处洗了，包扎起来。他病得完全失了知觉。他们细心看护他，他突然由昏迷中大叫起来，他们都害怕了，以为他发狂。医生给他水喝，安定他的心，使他睡去。他们安慰他的妻，告诉她依赛格林并无致命伤，可以放心。于是宫门闭了，群兽各自散归。





44


列那荣耀地向国王及王后告别。他们吩咐他不要在家过久，快些回到宫中来，他答道：“亲爱的王与后，我永远静候你们的差遣。我无时不预备以我的身体、我的财产为你们服役；我的所有亲友也都将听你们的任意差遣。我现在暂求回家，看我的妻子。你们如果需要我，只要使我知道，我立刻就来。”

于是国王也说了好些奖励的话，狐便动身回去了。

列那的亲友四十余，也向国王告别，和狐一道走。他心里很快活，竟如此地赢到了国王的欢心。他想以后再可以帮助他的朋友，且不再怕他的仇人了。

狐的朋友们一直送了他到了他的马里卜台堡，然后一个个地说了恭维的话而告别。列那也恭敬地感谢他们的好意与给他的荣耀，且说，他们如果有什么需要他，他当以体力与财力助他们。于是他们离开了，各向自己的家散去。

狐见了他的妻爱美林。她欢欢喜喜地迎接他。他告诉她和他的孩子们一切经过的事，一点也不遗漏。于是他们十分喜欢，知道他们的父亲现在已大得宠于国王。此后，狐与他的妻子便快快活活地过着一生。

“亲爱的王与后，我永远静候你们的差遣。”



“他告诉她和他的孩子们一切经过的事。”





CHAPTER I


IT was about the time of Pentecost or Whitsuntide, that the woods commonly be lusty and gladsome, and the trees clad with leaves and blossoms, and the ground with herbs and flowers sweet smelling, and also the fowls and birds singing melodiously in their harmony, that the Lion, the noble King of all Beasts, would in the holy days of this feast hold an open Court at state; which he did to know(1) over all in his land, and commanded by straight commissions and commandments that every Beast should come thither, in such wise that all the Beasts great and small came to the Court save Reynart the Fox: for he knew himself faulty and guilty in many things against many Beasts that thither should come, that he durst not adventure to go thither. When the King of all Beasts had assembled all his Court, there was none of them all but that he had complained sore on Reynart the Fox.

(1) Did to know, caused to be made known.





CHAPTER II


ESEGRIM the Wolf, with his lineage and friends, came and stood before the King, and said,“High and Mighty Prince, my Lord the King, I beseech you that through your great might, right, and mercy, that you will have pity on the great trespass and the unreasonable misdeeds that Reynart the Fox has done to me and to my wife: that is to wit, he is come in to my house against the will of my wife, and there he has bepissed my children whereas they lay, in such wise as they thereof are waxen blind. Whereupon was a day set, and was judged that Reynart should come and have excused him hereof, and have sworn on the holy saints that he was not guilty thereof. And when the book with the saints was brought forth, tho(1) had Reynart bethought him otherwise, and went his way again into his hole, as he had naught set thereby. And, dear King, this known well many of the Beasts that now be come hither to your Court. And yet has he trespassed to me in many other things. He is not living that could tell all that I now leave untold. But the shame and villainy that he has done my wife, that shall I never hide nor suffer it unavenged, but that he shall make to me large amends.”




————————————————————

(1) Tho, then.





CHAPTER III


WHEN these words were spoken, so stood there a little Hound and was named Courtoys, and complained to the King, how that in the cold winter in the hard frost he had been sore forwintered, in such wise as he had kept no more meat than a pudding, which pudding Reynart the Fox had taken away from him.

With this so came Tybert the Cat, with an irous(1) mood, and sprang in among them, and said:“My Lord the King, I here hear that Reynart is sore complained on, and here is none but that he has enough to do to clear himself. That Courtoys here complaines of, that is passed many years gone, howbeit, that I complain not; that pudding was mine, for I had won it by night in a mill. The miller lay and slept. If Courtoys had any part hereon, that came by me too.”

Tho spake Panther,“Think you, Tybert, that it were good that Reynart should not be complained on? He is a very murderer, a rover, and a thief, he loves no man so well, not our Lord the King here, but that he well would that he should lose good and worship, so that he might win as much as a leg of a fat hen. I shall tell you what I saw him do yesterday to Cuwart the Hare, that here stands in the King's peace and safeguard. He promised to Cuwart and said he would teach him his Credo, and make him a good chaplain. He made him go sit between his legs, and sang and cried loud,‘Credo, Credo!’My way lay thereby there that I heard this song. Tho went I near and found Master Reynart that had left that he first read and sang, and began to play his old play. For he had caught Cuwart by the throat, and had I not that time come he should have taken his life from him, like as you here may see on Cuwart the Hare the fresh wound yet. Forsooth, my Lord the King, if you suffer this unpunished, and let him go quit that has thus broken your peace, and will do no right after the sentence and judgment of your men, your children many years hereafter shall be misprised and blamed therefor.”

“Sikerly, Panther,”said Esegrim,“you say truth. It were good that right and justice were done, for them that would fain live in peace.”




————————————————————

(1) Irous, angry.





CHAPTER IV


THEN spake Grymbart the Dasse, and was Reynart's sister's son, with an angry mood.

“Sir Esegrim that is evil said. It is a common proverb an enemy's mouth says seldom well. What lie you and wite(1) you my Eme(2) Reynart? I would that you would adventure that who of you two had most trespassed to other should hang by the neck as a thief on a tree. But and if he were as well in this court and as well with the King as you be, it should not be thought in him that it were enough that you should come and ask him forgiveness; you have bitten and nipped my uncle with your fell and sharp teeth many more times than I can tell. Yet will I tell some points that I well know. Know not you how you misdealed on the plaice which he threw down from the car, when you followed after from afar, and you ate the good plaice alone, and gave him no more than the grate or bones which you might not eat yourself. In like wise did you to him also of the fat flitch of bacon which savoured so well that you alone ate it in your belly, and when my Eme asked his part tho answered you him again in scorn,‘Reynart, fair youngling, I shall gladly give you your part’—but my Eme got nor had nought, nor was not the better. Notwithstanding he had won the flitch of bacon with great dread, for the man came and threw him in a sack that he scarcely came out with his life. Such manner things has Reynart many times suffered through Esegrim. O you lordes, think you that this is good? Yet is there more. He complaines how that Reynart my Eme has much trespassed to him by cause of his wife. My Eme has lain by her, but that is well seven years before, ere he wedded her; and if Reynart for love and courtesy did with her his will, what was that? She was soon healed thereof. Hereof by right should be no complaint, were Esegrim wise. He should have believed that he does to himself no worship thus to slander his wife. She plaines not. Now makes Cuwart the Hare a complaint also. That thinks me a vyseuase.(3) If he read nor learned aright his lesson, should not Reynart his master beat him therefor? If the scholars were not beaten nor smitten and reprised(4) of their truantry, they should never learn. Now complaines Courtoys that he with pain had gotten a pudding in the winter, at such time as the cost(5) is evil to find. Thereof him had be better to have held his peace, for he had stolen it. Male quæsisti et male perdidisti. It is right that it be evil lost that is evil won. Who shall blame Reynart if he have taken from a thief stolen good. It is reason. Who that understands the law, and can discern the right, and that he be of high birth as my Eme Reynart is, knows well how he shall reserve stolen good. Yet all had he Courtoys hanged when he found him with the menour(6) he had not much misdone nor trespassed, save against the Crown, that he had done justice without leave. Wherefore for the honour of the King he did it not, all has he but little thanks. What scathed it him that he is thus complained on? My Eme is a gentle and true man. He may suffer no falsehood. He does nothing but by his priest's counsel. And I say you, since that my lord the King has do proclaim(7) his peace, he never thought to hurt any man; for he eats no more than once a day; he lives as a recluse; he chastises his body, and wears a shirt of hair; it is more than a year that he has eaten no flesh. As I yesterday heard say of them that came from him he has left and given over his Castle Maleperdays and has builded a cluse; therein dwells he and hunts no more nor desires no winning, but he lives by alms and takes nothing but such as men give him for charity, and does great penance for his sins, and he is waxen much pale and lean of praying and waking, for he would be fain with God.”

Thus as Grymbart his Eme stood and preached these words, so saw they coming down the hill to them Chanticleer the Cock and brought on a bier a dead hen of whom Reynart had bitten the head off, and that must be showed to the King for to have knowledge thereof.

CHAPTER V


CHANTICLEER came forth and smote piteously his hands and his feathers; and on each side of the bier went two sorrowful hens, that one was called Cantart and that other good hen Crayant, they were two the fairest hens that were between Holland and Arderne. These hens bare each of them a burning taper which was long and straight. These two hens were Coppen's sisters, and they cried so piteously“Alas and weleaway”for the death of their dear sister Coppen. Two young hens bare the bier, which cackled so heavily and wept so loud for the death of Coppen their mother, that it was very hard. Thus came they together before the King.

And Chanticleer tho said,“Merciful lord, my lord the King, please it you to hear our complaint and abhor the great scathe that Reynart has done to me and my children that here stand. It was so that in the beginning of April, when the weather is fair, as that I, as hardy and proud because of the great lineage that I am come of and also had, for I had eight fair sons and seven fair daughters which my wife had hatched, and they were all strong and fat, and went in a yard which was walled round about, in which was a shed wherein were six great dogs which had tore and plucked many a beast's skin in such wise as my children were not afraid. On whom Reynart the thief had great envy because they were so sure that he could none get of them; how well often has this fell thief gone round about this wall and has laid for us in such wise that the dogs have be set on him and have hunted him away; and once they leapt on him upon the bank, and that cost him somewhat for his theft, I saw that his skin smoked. Nevertheless he went his way. God amend it!

“Thus were we quit of Reynart a long while. At last came he in likeness of an hermit, and brought to me a letter for to read, sealed with the King's seal, in which stood written that the King had made peace over all in his realm, and that all manner beasts and fowls should do none harm nor scathe to any other. Yet said he to me more that he was a cloisterer or a closed recluse become, and that he would receive great penance for his sins. He showed me his slavyne and pylche(1) and an haired shirt thereunder, and then said he,‘sir Chanticleer after this time be no more afraid of me, nor take no heed, for I now will eat no more flesh. I am further so old that I would fain remember my soul. I will now go forth, for I have yet to say my sixth, none, and my evensong. To God I betake(2) you.’Tho went Reynart thence, saying his Credo, and laid him under an hawthorn. Then I was glad and merry, and also took none heed, and went to my children and clucked them together, and went without the wall for to walk; whereof is much harm come to us, for Reynart lay under a bush and came creeping between us and the gate, so that he caught one of my children and laid him in his male.(3) Whereof we have great harm, for since he has tasted of him there might never hunter nor hound save nor keep him from us. He has waited by night and day in such wise that he has stolen so many of my children that of fifteen I have but four, in such wise has this thief forslongen(4) them. And yet yesterday was Coppen my daughter, that here lies upon the bier, with the hounds rescued. This complain I to you, gracious King, have pity on my great and unreasonable damage and loss of my fair children!”

CHAPTER VI


THEN spake the King:

“Sir Dasse, hear you this well of the recluse of your Eme? He has fasted and prayed, that if I live a year he shall abye(1) it. Now hark, Chanticleer, your plaint is enough. Your daughter that lies here dead, we will give to her the death's rite. We may keep her no longer, we will betake her to God. We will sing her vigil and bring her worshipfully on earth, and then we will speak with these lords and take counsel how we may do right and justice of this great murder, and bring this false thief to the law.”

Tho began they Placebo domino, with the verses that to longen,(2) which if I should say were me too long. When this vigil was done and the commendation, she was laid in the pit, and there upon her was laid a marble stone polished as clear as any glass, and thereon was hewn in great letters in this wise: COPPE CHANTEKLERS DOUGHTER, WHOM REYNART THE FOX HAS BYTEN, LYETH HIER VNDER BURYED, COMPLAYNE YOU HER FFOR, SHE IS SHAMEFULLY COME TO HER DETH.

After this, the King sent for his lords and the wisest of his council for to take advice how this great murder and trespass should be punished on Reynart the Fox. There was concluded and appointed for the best that Reynart should be sent for, and that he left not for any cause, but he came into the King's court for to hear what should be said to him; and that Bruin the Bear should do the message.

The King thought that all this was good and said to Bruin the Bear,“Sir Bruin, I will that you do this message; but see well to for yourself, for Reynart is a shrew, and fell,(3) and knows so many wiles that he shall lie and flatter, and shall think how he may beguile, deceive, and bring you to some mockery.”

Then said Bruin,“What, good lord, let it alone! Deceives me the Fox, so have I ill learned my casus. I think he shall come too late to mock me.”

Thus departed Bruin merrily from thence, but it is to dread that he came not so merrily again.

CHAPTER VII


NOW is Bruin gone on his way toward the Fox with a stout mood, which supposed well that the Fox should not have beguiled him. As he came in a dark wood in a forest whereas Reynart had a bypath when he was hunted, there beside was an high mountain and land, and there must Bruin in the middle goon over for to go to Maleperdays. For Reynart had many a dwelling-place, but the Castle of Maleperdays was the best and the fastest burgh that he had. There lay he in when he had need, and was in any dread or fear. Now when Bruin was come to Maleperdays, he found the gate fast shut. Tho went he before the gate, and sat upon his tail, and called,“Reynart, be you at home? I am Browning. The King has sent me for you that you should come to Court, for to plead your cause. He has sworn there by his God, come you not, or bring I you not with me, for to abide such right and sentence as shall be there given, it shall cost you your life. He will hang you or set you on the rack. Reynart, do by my counsel, and come to the Court.”

Reynart lay within the gate, as he oft was wont to do, for the warmth of the sun. When Reynart heard Bruin, tho went he inward into his hole. For Maleperdays was full of holes, here one hole and there another, and yonder another, narrow, crooked and long, with many ways to go out, which he opened and shut after that he had need. When he had any prey brought home, or that he wist that any sought him for his misdeeds and trespasses, then he ran and hid him from his enemies into his secret chambers, that they could not find him; by which he deceived many a beast that sought him. And tho thought Reynard in himself how he might best bring the Bear in charge and need, and that he abode in worship.

In this thought Reynart came out, and said,“Bruin, Eme, you be welcome! I heard you well before, but I was in my evensong, therefore have I the longer tarried a little. Dear Eme, he has done to you no good service, and I con him no thank,(1) that has sent you over this long hill; for I see that you be also weary, that the sweat runs down by your cheeks. It was no need I had nevertheless come to Court to-morrow: but I sorrow now the less, for your wise counsel shall well help me in the Court. And could the King find none less messenger but you for to send hither? That is great wonder. For next the King you be the most gentle, and richest of levies and of land. I would well that we were now at the Court, but I fear me that I shall not con well go thither, for I have eaten so much new meat that me thinks my belly will break or cleave asunder, and because the meat was new I ate the more.”

Tho spake the Bear,“Lief Neve,(2) what meat have you eaten that maked you so full?”

“Dear Eme, that I ate, what might it help you that if I told you? I ate but simple meat. A poor man is no lord, that may you know, Eme, by me. We poor folk must eat often such as we gladly would not eat if we had better. They were great honey combs; which I must needs eat for hunger. They have made my belly so great that I can nowhere endure.”

Bruin then spake anon,“Alas, Reynart, what say you! Set you so little by honey? Me ought to prize and love it above all meat. Lief Reynart, help me that I might get a deal of this honey, and as long as I live I shall be to you a true friend, and abide by you, as far as you help me that I may have a part of this honey.”

CHAPTER VIII


“BRUIN, Eme, I had supposed that you had japed(1) therewith.”

“So help me God, Reynart, nay. I should not gladly jape with you.”

Then spake the red Reynart,“Is it then earnest, that you love so well the honey? I shall do let you have so much that ten of you should not eat it at one meal, might I get therewith your friendship.”

“Not we ten, Reynart Neve!”said the Bear.“How should that be? Had I all the honey that is between this and Portugal I should well eat it alone.”

Reynart said,“What say you, Eme? Hereby dwells an husbandman named Lantfert, which has so much honey that you should not eat in seven years; which you shall have in your hold if you will be to me friendly and helping against my enemies in the King's Court.”

Then promised Bruin the Bear to him, that if he might have his belly full he would truly be to him before all other a faithful friend.

Hereof laughed Reynart the shrew,(2) and said,“If you would have seven hamper barrels full I shall well get them and help you to have them.”These words pleased the Bear so well, and made him so much to laugh that he could not well stand.

Tho thought Reynart,“This is good luck; I shall lead him thither that he shall laugh by measure.”

Reynart said then,“This matter may not be long tarried. I must pain myself for you. You shall well understand the very yonste(3) and good will that I bear to you ward. I know none in all my lineage that I now would labour for thus sore.”

That thanked him the Bear and thought he tarried long.“Now, Eme, let us go a good pace, and follow you me. I shall make you to have as much honey as you may bear.”The Fox meant, of good strokes; but the caitiff marked not what the Fox meant; and they went so long together, that they came unto Lantfert's yard. Tho was sir Bruin merry.

Now hark of Lantfert. Is it true that men say, so was Lantfert a strong carpenter of great timber, and had brought that other day before into his yard a great oak, which he had begun to cleave. And as men be woned(4) he had smitten two betels(5) therein one after that other, in such wise the oak was wide open. Whereof Reynart was glad, for he had found it right as he wished, and said to the Bear all laughing,“See now well sharply to! In this tree is so much honey that it is without measure. Assay if you can come therein, and eat but little, for though the honeycombs be sweet and good, yet beware that you eat not too many, but take of them by measure, that you catch no harm in your body; for, sweet Eme, I should be blamed if they did you any harm.”

“What, Reynart, cousin, sorrow you not for me! Ween you that I were a fool?”

“Measure is good in all meat,”Reynart said.“You say truth. Wherefore should I sorrow? Go to the end and creep therein.”

Bruin the Bear hasted sore toward the honey, and trode in with his two foremost feet, and put his head over his ears into the clift of the tree. And Reynart sprang lightly and brake out the betle of the tree. Tho helped the Bear neither flattering nor chiding; he was fast shut in the tree. Thus has the Neve, with deceit, brought his Eme in prison in the tree, in such wise as he could not get out with might nor with craft, head nor foot.

What profits Bruin the Bear that he strong and hardy is? That may not help him. He saw well that he was beguiled. He began to howl, and to bray, and crutched with the hinder feet, and made such a noise and rumour, that Lantfert came out hastily, and knew nothing what this might be, and brought in his hand a sharp hook. Bruin the Bear lay in the clift of the tree, in great fear and dread, and held fast his head, and nipped both his fore feet. He wrang, he wrestled, and cried, and all was for naught. He wist not how he might get out.

Reynart the Fox saw from far how that Lantfert the carpenter came, and tho spake Reynart to the Bear,“Is that honey good? How is it now? Eat not too much, it should do you harm; you should not then well con go to the Court. When Lantfert comes, if you have well eaten he shall give you better to drink, and then it shall not stick in your throat.”

After these words tho turned him Reynart toward his castle, and Lantfert came and found the Bear fast taken in the tree. Then ran he fast to his neighbours and said,“Come all in to my yard, there is a bear taken!”The word anon sprang over all in the thorp. There nor bleef(6) neither man nor wife, but all ran thither as fast as they could, every one with his weapon, some with a staff, some with a rake, some with a broom, some with a stake of the hedge, and some with a flail; and the priest of the church had the staff of the cross, and the clerk brought a vane. The priest's wife Julocke came with her distaff, —she sat tho and span, —there came old women that for age had not one tooth in their head.

Now was Bruin the Bear nigh much sorrow that he alone must stand against them all. When he heard all this great noise and cry he wrestled and plucked so hard and so sore that he got out his head. But he left behind all the skin and both his ears, in such wise that never man saw fouler nor loather beast, for the blood ran over his eyes. And or he could get out his feet he must lete(7) there his claws or nails and this rough hand. This market came to him evil, for he supposed never to have gone, his feet were so sore, and he might not see for the blood which ran so over his eyes.

Lantfert came to him with the priest, and forthwith all the parish, and began to smite and strike sore upon his head and visage. He received there many a sore stroke. Every man beware hereby: who has harm and scathe, every man will be thereat and put more to. That was well seen on the Bear, for they were all fierce and wroth on the Bear, great and small, yea Hughelyn with the crooked leg, and Ludolf with the broad long nose, they were both wroth. That one had a leaden malle, and that other a great leaden wapper, therewith they wappered and all forslingered(8) him, Sir Bertolt with the long fingers, Lantfert, and Ottram the long. This did to the Bear more harm than all the other, that one had a sharp hook and the other a crooked staff well leaded on the end for to play at the ball. Baetkyn and Aue, Abelquak, my dame Baue, and the priest with his staff, and dame Julocke his wife, these worked to the Bear so much harm that they would fain have brought him from his life to death, they smote and stack him all that they could.

Bruin the Bear sat and sighed and groaned, and must take such as was given to him. But Lantfert was the worthiest of birth of them all, and made most noise; for dame Pogge of Chafporte was his mother, and his father was Macob the stoppelmaker, a much stout man. There as he was alone Bruin received of them many a cast of stones. Before them all sprang first Lantfert's brother with a staff, and smote the Bear on the head that he nor heard nor saw; and therewith the Bear sprang up between the bush and the river among a heap of wives, that he threw a deal of them in the river, which was wide and deep.

There was the parson's wife one of them, wherefore he was full of sorrow when he saw his wife lie in the water. He lusted no longer to smite the Bear, but called,“Dame Julocke in the water! Now every man see to, All they that may help her! Be they men or women, I give to them all pardon of their penance, and release all their sins!”All they then left Bruin the Bear lie, and did that the priest bade.

When Bruin the Bear saw that they ran all from him, and ran to save the women, tho sprang he into the water and swam all that he could. Then made the priest a great shout and noise, and ran after the Bear with great anger, and said,“Come and turn again, thou false thief!”The Bear swam after the best of the stream and let them call and cry, for he was glad that he was so escaped from them. He cursed and banned the honey tree, and the Fox also that had so betrayed him that he had crept therein so deep that he lost both his hood and his ears. And so forth he drove in the stream well a two or three mile. Tho wax he so weary that he went to land for to sit and rest him, for he was heavy; he groaned and sighed, and the blood leapt over his eyes, he drew his breath like as one should have died.

Now hark how the Fox did. Ere he came from Lantfert's house he had stolen a fat hen and had laid her in his male, and ran hastily away by a byou path where he weened that no man should have come. He ran toward the river, that he sweat, he was so glad that he wist not what to do for joy, for he hoped that the Bear had been dead. He said,“I have now well sped, for he that should most have hindered me in the Court is now dead, and none shall wite(9) me thereof, may I not, then, by right be well glad?”With these words the Fox looked to the riverward, and espied where Bruin the Bear lay and rested him. Tho was the Fox sorrier and heavier than before was merry, and was as angry, and said in chiding to Lantfert,“Alas, Lantfert, lewd fool! God give him a shames death that has lost such good venison, which is good and fat, and has let him go which was taken to his hand! Many a man would gladly have eaten of him. He has lost a rich and fat Bear.”Thus all chiding he came to the river, where he found the Bear sore wounded, bled, and right sick, which he might thank none better thereof than Reynart, which he spake to the Bear in scorn:“Chiere priestre, Dieu vous garde! Will you see the red thief?”

Said the Bear to himself,“The ribald and the fell deer,(10) here I see him coming.”

Then said the Fox,“Have you aught forgotten at Lantfert's? Have you also paid him for the honeycombs that you stole from him? If you have not, it were a great shame, and not honest; I will rather be the messenger myself for to go and pay him. Was the honey not good? I know yet more of the same prize. Dear Eme, tell me ere I go hence into what order will you go that wear this new hood? Were you a monk or an abbot? He that shaved your crown has nipped off your ears, you have lost your top and don off your gloves, I think verily that you will go sing compline.”

All this heard Bruin the Bear, and waxed all angry, and sorry for he might not avenge him. He let the Fox say his will, and with great pain suffered it, and start again in the river, and swam down with the stream to that other side.

Now must he sorrow how that he should come to the Court, for he had lost his ears and the skin with the claws of his forefeet; for though a man should have slain him he could not go; and yet he must needs forth, but he wist not how.

Now hear how he did. He sat upon his hams and began to rustle over his tail; and when he was so weary, he wentled(11) and tumbled nigh half a mile; this did he with great pain so long till at last he came to the Court. And when he was seen so coming from far, some doubted what it might be that came so wenteling.

The King at last knew him, and was not well paid,(12) and said,“This is Bruin the Bear, my friend! Lord God, who has wounded him thus? He is passing red on his head: me thinks he is hurt unto the death. Where may he have been?”

CHAPTER IX


THEREWITH is the Bear came before the king, and said:

“I complain to you, merciful lord, sir King, so as you may see how that I am handled, praying you to avenge it upon Reynart the fell beast; for I have gotten this in your service. I have lost both my foremost feet, my cheeks, and my ears, by his false deceit and treason.”

The King said,“How durst this false thief Reynart do this? I say to you, Bruin, and swear by my crown, I shall so avenge you on him that you shall con me thank!”

He sent for all the wise beasts and desired counsel how that he might avenge this over-great wrong that the Fox had done. Then the council concluded, old and young, that he should be sent for, and dayed(1) earnestly again, for to abide such judgment as should there be given on him of all his trespasses. And they thought that the cat Tybert might best do this message if he would, for he is right wise. The King thought this counsel good.

(1) Dayed, cited for an appointed day.





CHAPTER X


THEN the King said,“Sir Tybert, you shall now go to Reynart and say to him this second time, that he come to Court unto the plea for to answer; for though he be fell to other beasts, he trusts you well and shall do by your counsel. And tell him if he come not he shall have the third warning and be dayed, and if he then come not, we shall proceed by right against him and all his lineage without mercy.”

Tybert spake,“My lord the King, they that this counselled you were not my friends. What shall I do there? He will not, for me neither, come nor abide. I beseech you, dear King, send some other to him. I am little and feeble. Bruin the Bear, which was so great and strong, could not bring him. How should I then take it on hand?”

“Nay,”said the King,“Sir Tybert, you are wise and well learned. Though you be not great, there lies not on. Many do more with craft and cunning than with might and strength.”

Then said the Cat,“Since it must needs be done, I must then take it upon me. God give grace that I may well achieve it, for my heart is heavy, and evil willed thereto.”

Tybert made him soon ready toward Maleperdays. And he saw from far come flying one of Saint Martin's birds, tho cried he loud and said,“All hail, gentle bird, turn thy wings hitherward, and fly on my right side.”The bird flew forth upon a tree which stood on the left side of the Cat. Tho was Tybert woe; for he thought it was a shrewd token and a sign of harm. For if the bird had flown on his right side he had been merry and glad, but now he sorrowed that his journey should turn to unhappe. Nevertheless he did as many do, and gave to himself better hope than his heart said. He went and ran to Maleperdays ward, and there he found the Fox alone standing before his house.

Tybert said,“The rich God give you good even, Reynart. The King has menaced you for to take your life from you if you come not now with me to the court.”

The Fox tho spake and said,“Tybert, my dear cousin, you be right welcome. I would well truly that you had much good luck.”What hurted the Fox to speak fair. Though he said well, his heart thought it not, and that shall be seen ere they depart.

Reynart said,“Will we this night be together. I will make you good cheer, and to-morrow early in the dawning we will together go to the Court. Good Nephew, let us so do, I have none of my kin that I trust so much to as to you. Here was Bruin the Bear, —the traitor! He looked so shrewdly on me, and methought he was so strong, that I would not for a thousand mark have gone with him; but, cousin, I will to-morrow early go with you.”

Tybert said,“It is best that we now go, for the moon shines all so light as it were day; I never saw fairer weather.”

“Nay, dear cousin, such might meet us by day-time that would make us good cheer and by night peradventure might do us harm. It is suspicious to walk by night. Therefore abide this night here by me.”

Tybert said,“What should we eat if we abode here?”

Reynart said,“Here is but little to eat. You may well have an honeycomb, good and sweet. What say you, Tybert, will you any thereof?”

Tybert answered,“I set nought thereby. Have you nothing else? If you gave me a good fat mouse I should be better pleased.”

“A fat mouse!”said Reynart.“Dear cousin, what say you? Hereby dwells a priest and has a barn by his house; therein are so many mice that a man should not lead them away upon a wain. I have heard the priest many times complain that they did him much harm.”

“Oh, dear Reynart, lead me thither for all that I may do for you!”

“Yea, Tybert, say you me truth? Love you well mice?”

“If I love them well?”said the Cat.“I love mice better than anything that men give me. Know you not that mice savour better than, venison, yea, than flawnes(1) or pasties? Will you well do, so lead me thither where the mice are, and then shall you win my love, yea all had you slain my father, mother, and all my kin.”

Reynart said,“You mock and jape therewith.”

The Cat said,“So help me God, I do not!”

“Tybert,”said the Fox,“wist I that verily, I would yet this night make that you should be full of mice.”

“Reynart!”quoth he,“Full? That were many.”

“Tybert, you jape!”

“Reynart,”quoth he,“in truth I do not. If I had a fat mouse I would not give it for a golden noble.”

“Let us go, then, Tybert,”quoth the Fox,“I will bring you to the place ere I go from you.”

“Reynart,”quoth the Cat,“upon your safe-conduct, I would well go with you to Monpelier.”

“Let us then go,”said the Fox,“we tarry all too long.”

Thus went they forth, without letting(2) to the place whereas they would be, to the Priest's barn, which was fast walled about with a mud wall. And the night before the Fox had broken in, and had stolen from the Priest a good fat hen; and the Priest, all angry, had set a gryn(3) before the hole to avenge him; for he would fain have taken the Fox. This knew well the fell thief, the Fox, and said,“Sir Tybert, cousin, creep into this hole, and you shall not long tarry but that you shall catch mice by great heaps. Hark how they pipe! When you be full, come again; I will tarry here after you before this hole. We will to-morrow go together to the Court. Tybert, why tarry you thus long ? Come off, and so may we return soon to my wife which waiteth after us, and shall make us good cheer.”

Tybert said,“Reynart, cousin, is it then your counsel that I go into this hole? These Priests are so wily and shrewish I dread to take harm.”

“Oh ho, Tybert!”said the Fox,“I saw you never so sore afraid. What ails you?”

The Cat was ashamed, and sprang into the hole. And anon he was caught in the gryn by the neck, ere he wist. Thus deceived Reynart his guest and cousin.

As Tybert was ware of the gryn, he was afraid and sprang forth; the gryn went to. Then he began to wrawen, for he was almost strangled. He called, he cried, and made a shrewd noise.

Reynart stood before the hole and heard all, and was well paid, and said,“Tybert, love you well mice? Be they fat and good? Knew the Priest hereof, or Mertynet, they be so gentle that they would bring you sauce. Tybert, you sing and eat, is that the guise of the Court? Lord God, if Esegrim were there by you, in such rest as you now be, then should I be glad; for oft he has done me scathe and harm.”

Tybert could not go away, but he mawed and galped so loud, that Mertynet sprang up, and cried loud,“God be thanked, my gryn has taken the thief that has stolen our hens. Arise up, we will reward him!”

With these words arose the Priest in an evil time, and waked all them that were in the house, and cried with a loud voice,“The Fox is taken!”

There leapt and ran all that there was. The Priest himself ran, all mother naked. Mertynet was the first that came to Tybert. The Priest took to Locken his wife an offering candle, and bade her light it at the fire, and he smote Tybert with a great staff. There received Tybert many a great stroke over all his body. Mertynet was so angry that he smote the Cat an eyou out. The naked Priest lift up and should have given a great stroke to Tybert, but Tybert that saw that he must die sprang between the Priest's legs with his claws and with his teeth. That leap became ill to the Priest and to his great shame.

When Dame Julocke knew that, she sware by her father's soul, that she would it had cost her all the offering of a whole year, that the Priest had not had that harm, hurt, and shame, and that it had not happened; and said,“In the Devil's name was the gryn there set! See Mertynet, lief son, this is a great shame and to me a great hurt!”The Fox stood without, before the hole, and heard all these words, and laughed so sore that he vnnethe(4) could stand. Thus scorned and mocked the Fox the Priest's wife, Dame Julocke, that was full of sorrow. The Priest fell down aswoon. They took him up, and brought him again to bed. Tho went the Fox again in to his burgh ward and left Tibert the Cat in great dread and jeopardy, for the Fox wist none other but that the Cat was nigh dead. But when Tibert the Cat saw them all busy about the Priest, tho began he to bite and gnaw the gryn in the middle asunder; and sprang out of the hole, and went rolling and wentling towards the King's Court. Ere he came thither it was fair day, and the sun began to rise. And he came to the Court as a poor wight. He had caught harm at the Priest's house by the help and counsel of the Fox. His body was all tobeaten, and blind on the one eye. When the King wist this, that Tibert was thus arrayed, he was sore angry, and menaced Reynart the thief sore, and anon gathered his council to wit what they would advise him, how he might bring the Fox to the law, and how he should be fetched.

Tho spake Sir Grymbart, which was the Fox's sister son, and said,“You lords, though my Eme were twice so bad and shrewish, yet is there remedy enough. Let him be done to as to a free man. When he shall be judged he must be warned the third time for all; and if he come not then, he is then guilty in all the trespasses that have been laid against him and his, or complained on.”

“Grymbart, who would you that should go and dayou him to come? Who will adventure for him his ears, his eye, or his life; which is so fell a beast? I think there is none here so much a fool.”

Grymbart spake,“So help me God, I am so much a fool that I will do this message myself to Reynart, if you will command me.”

CHAPTER XI


“NOW go forth, Grymbart, and see well before you. Reynart is so fell and false, and so subtle, that you need well to look about you and to beware of him.”

Grymbart said he should see well to.

Thus went Grymbart to Maleperdays ward, and when he came thither he found Reynart the Fox at home, and Dame Ermelyn his wife lay with her whelps in a dark corner.

Tho spake Grymbart and saluted his Eme and his Aunt, and said to Reynart,“Eme, beware that your absence hurt you not in such matters as be laid and complained on you; but if you think it good, it is high time that you come with me to the Court. The withholding you from it can do you no good. There is much thing complained over you, and this is the third warning; and I tell you for truth, if you abide to-morrow all day, there may no mercy help you. You shall see that within three days that your house shall be besieged all about, and there shall be made before it gallows and rack. I say you truly you shall not then escape, neither with wife nor with child, the King shall take all your lives from you. Therefore it is best that you go with me to the Court. Your subtle wise counsel shall peradventure avail you. There are greater adventures fallen, ere this; for it may hap you shall go quit of all the complaints that have been complained on you, and all your enemies shall abide in the shame. You have often done more and greater things than this.”

Reynart the Fox answered,“You say sooth. I think it is best that I go with you, for there lacks my counsel. Peradventure the King shall be merciful to me if I may come to speak with him, and see him under his eyes. Though I had done much more harm, the Court may not stand without me; that shall the King well understand. Though some be so fell to me ward, yet it goes not to the heart. All the council shall conclude much by me. Where great Courts have been gathered, of kings or of great lords, whereas needs subtle counsel, there must Reynart find the subtle means. They may well speak and say their advice, but tho my is best, and that goes before all other. In the Court are many that have sworn to do me the worst they can, and that causes me a part to be heavy in my heart, for many may do more than one alone that shall hurt me. Nevertheless, nephew, it is better I go with you to the Court and answer for myself, than to set me my wife and my children in adventure for to be lost. Arise up, let us go hence. He is over mighty for me. I must do as he will. I cannot better it; I shall take it patiently and suffer it.”

Reynart said to his wife Dame Ermelyn,“I betake you my children, that you see well to them and specially to Reynkin, my youngest son. He belikes me so well I hope he shall follow my steps. And there is Rossel a passing fair thief, I love them as well as any may love his children. If God give me grace that I may escape, I shall, when I come again, thank you with fair words.”Thus took Reynart leave of his wife.

Ah, gods! how sorrowful abode Ermelyn with her small whelps, for the victualler and he that sorrowed(1) for Maleperdays was gone his way, and the house not purveyed nor victualled.

CHAPTER XII


WHEN Reynart and Grymbart had gone a while together, tho said Reynart,“Dear Cousin, now am I in great fear, for I go in dread and jeopardy of my life. I have so much repentance for my sins that I will shrive me, dear Cousin, to you; here is none other priest to get. If I were shriven of my sins my soul should be the clearer.”

Grymbart answered,“Eme, will you shrive you, then must you promise first to leave your stealing and roving.”

Reynart said, that wist he well.“Now hark, dear Cousin, what I shall say. Confiteor tibi, pater, of all the misdeeds that I have done, and gladly will receive penance for them.”

Grymbart said,“What say you, will you shrive you? Then say it in English, that I may understand you.”

Reynart said,“I have trespassed against all the beasts that live; in especial against Bruin the Bear, my Eme, whom I made his crown all bloody; and taught Tybert the Cat to catch mice, for I made her leap in a grynne where she was all to-beaten; also I have trespassed greatly against Chanticleer with his children, for I have made him quit of a great deal of them. The King is not gone all quit, I have slandered him and the Queen many times, that they shall never be clear thereof. Yet have I beguiled Esegrim the Wolf, oftener than I can tell well. I called him Eme, but that was to deceive him; he is nothing of my kin. I made him a monk at Eelmare, where I myself also became one; and that was to his hurt and no profit. I made bind his feet to the bell rope, the ringing of the bell thought him so good that he would learn to ring; whereof he had shame, for he rang so sore that all the folk in the street were afraid thereof and marvelled what might be on the bell, and ran thither before he had come to axe the religion, wherefore he was beaten almost to the death. After this I taught him to catch fish, where he received many a stroke; also I led him to the richest priest's house that was in Vermedos, this priest had a spynde wherein hung many a good flitch of bacon wherein many a time I was wont to fill my belly; in this spynde I had made an hole in which I made Esegrim to creep. There found he tubs with beef and many good flitches of bacon, whereof he ate so much without measure that he might not come out at the hole where he went in; his belly was so great and full of the meat, and when he entered his belly was small; I went in to the village and made there a great shout and noise; yet hark what I did then, I ran to the priest where he sat at the table and ate, and had before him as fat capon as a man might find: that capon caught I, and ran my way therewith all that I might. The priest cried out, and said,‘Take and slay the Fox! I think that man never saw more wonder. The Fox comes in my house and takes my capon from my table: where saw ever man an hardier thief!’and as me thought he took his table knife and cast it at me, but he touched me not. I ran away, he shoved the table from him and followed me crying‘Kill and slay him!’I too go, and they after, and many moo came after, which all thought to hurt me.

“I ran so long that I came whereas Esegrim was, and there I let fall the capon, for it was too heavy for me, and against my will I left it there, and then I sprang through a hole whereas I would be. And as the priest took up the capon, he espied Esegrim and cried,‘Smite down here, friends, here is the thief, the Wolf! See well to, that he escape us not!’They ran all together with stocks and staves, and made a great noise, that all the neighbours camen out, and gave him many a shrewd stroke, and threw at him great stones, in such wise that he fell down as he had been dead. They slipped him and drew him over stones and over blocks without the village and threw him into a ditch, and there he lay all the night. I wot never how he came thence, since I have goten of him, for as much as I made him to fill his belly, that he sware he would be my help a whole year.

“Tho led I him to a place where I told him there were seven hens and a cock which sat on a perch and were much fat. And there stood a fall-door by, and we climbed thereup. I said to him if he would believe me, and that he would creep into the door, he should find many fat hens. Esegrim went all laughing to the doorward, and crept a little in, and tasted here and there, and at last he said to me,‘Reynart, you bord and jape with me, for what I seek I find not.’Then said I,‘Eme, if you will find, creep further in. He that will win, he must labour and adventure. They that were wont to sit there, I have them away.’Thus I made him to seek further in, and shoved him forth so far, that he fell down upon the floor, for the perch was narrow. And he fell so great a fall, that they sprang up all that slept, and they that next the fire cryden that the fall-door was open and something was fallen, and they wist not what it might be. They rose up and light a candle, and when they saw him, they smiten, beaten, and wounded him to the death. I have brought him thus in many a jeopardy, more than I can now reckon. I should find many more, if I me well bethought, which I shall tell you hereafter. Also I have bedriuen(1) with dame Ersewynde his wife. I would I had not done it. I am sorry for it. It is to her great shame, and that me repents.”

Grymbart said,“Eme, I understand you not.”

He said,“I have trespassed with his wife.”

“You shrive you, as though you held somewhat behind. I wot not what you mean, nor where you have learned this language.”

“Ach, Dear Neve, it were great shame if I should say it openly as it happened. I have lain by my aunt, I am your Eme, I should anger you if I spake villainy of women. Nephew, now have I told you all that I can think on. Set me penance, and assoil me, for I have great repentance.”

Grymbart was subtle and wise. He broke a rod off a tree and said,“Eme, now shall you smite yourself thrice with this rod on your body, and then lay it down upon the ground, and spring three times thereover, without bowing of your legs and without stumbling, and then shall you take it up and kiss it friendly in token of meekness and obedience of your penance that I gave you. Herewith be you quit of all sins that you have done to this day, for I forgive it you all.”

The Fox was glad.

Tho said Grymbart to his Eme,“Eme, see now further that you do good works: read your psalms, go to church, fast, and keep your holydays, and give your alms; and leave your sinful and ill life, your theft, and your treason, and so may you come to mercy.”

The Fox promised that he would so do, and then went they both together to the Court ward.

A little beside the way as they went stood a cloister of black nuns, where many geese, hens and capons went without the walls; and as they went talking the Fox brought Grymbart out of' the right way thither, and without the walls by the barn went the polaylle. The Fox espied them, and saw a fat young capon which went alone from his fellows, and leapt, and caught him that the feathers flew about his ears, but the capon escaped.

Grymbart said,“What, Eme, cursed man, what will you do! Will you for one of these pullets fall again in all your sins of which you have shriven you ? You ought sore repent you.”

Reynart answered,“Truly, cousin, I had all forgotten. Pray God that he forgive it me, for I will never do so more.”

Then turned they again over a little bridge, yet the Fox alway looked after the polaylle; he could not refrain himself; that which clevid by the bone might not out of the flesh: though he should be hanged he could not let the looking after the polaylle as far as he might see them.

Grymbart saw his manner, and said,“Foul false deceiver, how go your eyes so after the polaylle!”

The Fox said,“Cousin, you misdo to say to me any such words. You bring me out of my devotion and prayers. Let me say a pater noster for all the souls of polaylle and geese that I have betrayed, and oft with falsehood stolen from these holy nuns.”

Grymbart was not well apaid, but the Fox had ever his eyes toward the polaylle(2) till at last they came in the way again, and then turned they to the Courtward. How sore quaked tho Reynart when they approached the Court! For he wist well that he had for to answer to many a foul feat and theft that he had done.

CHAPTER XIII


AT the first when it was known in the Court that Reynart the Fox and Grymbart his cousin were come to the Court, there was none so poor nor so feeble of kin and friends but that he made him ready for to complain on Reynart the Fox.

Reynart looked as he had not been afraid, and held him better than he was, for he went forth proudly with his nephew through the highest street of the Court, right as he had been the King's son, and as he had not trespassed to any man the value of an hair: and went in the middle of the place standing before Noble the King and said—

“God give you great honour and worship. There was never King that ever had a truer servant than I have been to your good grace, and yet am. Nevertheless, dear lord, I know well that there are many in this Court that would destroy me if you would believe them; but nay, God thank you, it is not fitting to your crown to believe these false deceivers and liars lightly. To God mote it be complained how that these false liars and flatterers nowadays in the lord's Courts are most heard and believed, the shrews and false deceivers are borne up for to do to good men all the harm and scathe they may. Our Lord God shall once reward them their hire.”

The King said,“Peace, Reynart, false thief and traitor! How well can you bring forth fair tales! And all shall not help you a straw. Ween you with such flattering words to be my friend, you have so oft served me so as you now shall well know. The peace that I have commanded and sworn, that have you well holden, have you?”

Chanticleer could no longer be still, but cried,“Alas, what have I by this peace lost!”

“Be still, Chanticleer, hold your mouth. Let me answer this foul thief. Thou shrewd fell thief,”said the King,“thou sayest that thou lovest me well: that hast thou showed well on my messengers, these poor fellows, Tibert the Cat and Bruin the Bear, which yet are all bloody; which chide not nor say not much, but that shall this day cost thee thy life. In nomy Patris et Christi filii.”

Said the Fox,“Dear lord and mighty King, if Bruin's crown be bloody what is that to me? When he ate honey at Lantfert's house in the village and did him hurt and scathe, there was he beaten therefor; if he had willed, he is so strong of limbs, he might well have be avenged ere he sprang into the water. Tho came Tybert the Cat, whom I received friendly. If he went out without my counsel for to steal mice to a priest's house, and the priest did him harm, should I abyou that, then might I say I were not happy. Not so, my liege lord. You may do what you will, though my matter be clear and good; you may siede(1) me, or roast, hang, or make me blind. I may not escape you. We stand all under your correction. You be mighty and strong. I am feeble, and my help is but small. If you put me to the death it were a small vengeance.”

Whiles they thus spake, up sprang Bellyn the Ram and his ewe Dame Olewey, and said,“My lord the King, hear our complaint.”Bruin the Bear stood up with all his lineage and hisfellows. Tybert the Cat, Esegrim the Wolf, Cuwart the Hare, and Panther; the Boar, the Camel, and Brunel the Goose; the Kid and Goat; Boudewyn the Ass, Borre the Bull, Hamel the Ox, and the Weasel; Chanticleer the Cock, Pertelot with all their children, all these made great rumour and noise, and came forth openly before their lord the King, and made that the Fox was taken and arrested.

CHAPTER XIV


HEREUPON was a Parliament; and they desired that Reynart should have been dead. And whatsomever they said against the Fox he answered to each to them. Never heard man of such beasts such plaints of wise counsel and subtle inventions. And on that other side, the Fox made his excuse so well and formably thereon, that they that heard it wondered thereof. They that heard and saw it may tell it forth for truth; I shall short the matter and tell you forth of the Fox. The King and the Council heard the witnesses of the complaints of Reynart's misdeeds. It went with them as it oft does, the feeblest has the worst. They gave sentence, and judged that the Fox should be dead and hanged by the neck. Tho list not he to play. All his flattering words and deceits could not help him. The judgment was given, and that must be done. Grymbart, his nephew, and many of his lineage might not find in their hearts to see him die, but took leave sorrowfully, and roomed(1) the court.

The King bethought him, and marked how many a youngling departed from thence all weeping, which were nigh of his kin, and said to himself,“Here behoves other counsel hereto; though Reynart be a shrew, there be many good of his lineage.”

Tybert the Cat said,“Sir Bruin and Sir Esegrim, how be you thus slow? It is almost even. Here are many bushes and hedges. If he escaped from us and were delivered out of this peril, he is so subtle, and so wily, and can so many deceits, that he should never be taken again. Shall we hang him? How stand you all thus? Ere the gallows can be made ready it shall be night.”

Esegrim bethought him tho, and said,“Hereby is a gibbet or gallows.”And with that word he sighed.

And the Cat espied that, and said,“Esegrim, you be afraid. Is it against your will? Think you not that he himself went and laboured that both your brethren were hanged? Were you good and wise, you should thank him, and you should not therewith so long tarry.”

CHAPTER XV


1 ESEGRIM balked(1) and said,“You make much ado, Sir Tybert; had we an halter which were meet for his neck and strong enough, we should soon make an end.”

Reynart the Fox, which long had not spoken, said to Esegrim,“Short my pain. Tybert has a strong cord which caught him in the Priest's house. He can climb well, and is swift; let him bear up the line. Esegrim and Bruin, this becomes you well, that you thus do to your Nephew! I am sorry that I live thus long; haste you, you be set thereto; it is evil do that you tarry thus long. Go before, Bruin, and lead me; Esegrim, follow fast, and see well to, and be ware that Reynart go not away.”

Tho said Bruin,“It is the best counsel that I ever yet heard, that Reynart here says.”

Esegrim commanded anon and bade his kin and friends that they should see to Reynart that he escaped not, for he is so wily and false. They held him by the feet, by the beard; and so kept him that he escaped not from them.

The Fox heard all these words, which touched him nigh, yet spake he and said,“Oh, dear Eme, methinks you pain yourself sore for to do me hurt and scathe. If I durst, I would pay you of mercy, though my hurt and sorrow is pleasant to you. I wot well, if my Aunt, your wife, bethought her well of old ferners,(2) she would not suffer that I should have any harm; but now I am he that now you will do on me what it shall please you. You Bruin and Tybert, God give you shames death but you do to me your worst. I wot whereto I shall. I may die but once, I would that I were dead already. I saw my father die, he had soon done.”

Esegrim said,“Let us go, for you curse us because we lengthen the time. Evil might we fare if we abide any longer.”

He went forth with great envy on that one side, and Bruin stood on the other side, and so led they him forth to the gallows ward. Tybert ran with a good will before, and bare the cord; and his throat was yet sore of the grynne, and his croppe did him woe of the stroke that he was take in; that happened by the counsel of the Fox, and that thought he now to quit.

Tybert Esegrim and Bruin went hastily with Reynart to the place there as the felons are wont to be put to death. Noble the King and the Queen and all that were in the Court followed after, for to see the end of Reynart. The Fox was in great dread if him myshapped, and bethought him oft how he might save him from the death; and tho three that so sore desired his death, how he might deceive them and bring them to shame; and how he might bring the King with leasings for to hold with him against them. This was all that he studied, how he might put away his sorrow with wiles, and thought thus:“Though the King and many one be upon me angry, it is no wonder, for I have well deserved it; nevertheless, I hope for to be yet their best friend. And yet shall I never do them good. How strong that the King be, and how wise that his council be, if I may brook(3) my words I know so many an invention, I shall come to my above(4) as far as they would come to the gallows.”

Tho said Esegrim,“Sir Bruin, think now on your red crown which by Reynart's mean you caught; we have now the time that we may well reward him. Tybert, clime up hastily and bind the cord fast to the lynde, and make a riding knot or a strope, you be the lightest; you shall this day see your will of him. Bruin, see well to, that he escape not, and hold fast. I will help that the ladder be set up, that he may go upward thereon.”

Bruin said,“Do. I shall help him well.”

The Fox said,“Now may my heart be well heavy for great dread; for I see the death before my eyes, and I may not escape. My lord the King, and dear Queen, and forth all you that here stand, ere I depart from this world I pray you of a boon: that I may before you all make my confession openly, and tell my defaults all so clearly that my soul may not be acumbred, and also that no man hereafter bear no blame for my theft nor for my treason. My death shall be to me the easier, and pray you all to God that he have mercy on my soul.”

CHAPTER XVI


ALL they that stood there had pity when Reynart said tho words, and said it was but a little request if the King would grant it him, and they prayed the King to grant it him. The King gave him leave.

Reynart was well glad, and hoped that it might fall better, and said thus:

“Now help, Spiritus Domini, for I see here no man but I have trespassed unto. Nevertheless yet was I, unto the time that I was weaned from the teat, one of the best children that could anywhere be found. I went tho and played with the lambs, because I heard them gladly bleat. I was so long with them that at the last I bit one; there learned I first to lappen of the blood. It savoured well; me thought it right good. And after I began to taste of the flesh thereof, I was licorous; so that after that I went to the gate into the wood, there heard I the kids bleat and I slew of them two. I began to wax hardy after. I slew hens, polaylle and geese wherever I found them. Thus worden(1) my teeth all bloody. After this, I wex so fell and so wroth that whatsomever I found that I might over, I slew all. Thereafter came I by Esegrim, now in the winter, where he hid him under a tree, arid reckoned to me that he was my eme. When I heard him then reckon alliance, we became fellows, which I may well repent. We promised each to other to be true, and to use good fellowship, and began to wander together. He stole the great things and I the small, and all was common between us. Yet he made it so that he had the best deal;(2) I got not half my part. When that Esegrim got a calf a ram or a wether, then grimmed he, and was angry on me, and drove me from him, and held my part and his too, so good is he. Yet this was of the least. But when it so lucked that we took an ox or a cow, then came thereto his wife with seven children; so that unto me might vnnethe come one of the smallest ribs, and yet, had they eaten all the flesh thereof, therewithall must I be content; not for that I had so great need, for I have so great scatte(3) and good of silver and of gold, that seven wains should not can carry it away.”

When the King heard him speak of this great good and riches, he burned in the desire and covetyse thereof, and said,“Reynart, where is the riches become? tell me that.”

The Fox said,“My lord, I shall tell you. The riches was stolen. And had it not be stolen, it should have cost you your life and you should have been murdered, —which God forbid!—and should have been the greatest hurt in the world.”

When the Queen heard that, she was sore afraid and cried aloud,“Alas and weleaway! Reynart, what say you? I conjure you by the long way that your soul shall go, that you tell us openly the truth hereof, as much as you know of this great murder that should have be done on my lord, that we all may hear it!”

Now hearken how the Fox shall flatter the King and Queen, and shall win both their good will and loves, and shall hinder them that labour for his death. He shall unbind his pack and lie, and by flattery and fair words shall bring forth so his matters that it shall be supposed for truth.

In a sorrowful countenance spake the Fox to the Queen,“I am in such case now that I must needs die, and had you me not so sore conjured I will not jeopardise my soul, and if I so died I should go therefor in to the pain of hell. I will say nothing but that I will make it good, for piteously he should have been murdered of his own folk. Nevertheless they that were most principal in this feat were of my next kin, whom gladly I would not betray, if the sorrow were not of the hell.”

The King was heavy of heart, and said,“Reynart, sayest thou to me the truth?”

“Yes,”said the Fox.“See you not how it stands with me? Ween you that I shall damn my soul? What should it avail me if I now said otherwise than truth? My death is so nigh. There may neither prayer nor good help me.”Tho trembled the Fox, by dissembling, as he had been afraid.

The Queen had pity on him, and prayed the King to have mercy on him, in eschewing of more harm, and that he should do the people hold their peace, and give the Fox audience, and hear what he should say.

Tho commanded the King openly that each of them should be still, and suffer the Fox to say unberisped(4) what that he would.

Then said the Fox,“Be you now all still, since it is the King's will, and I shall tell you openly this treason. And therein will I spare no man that I know guilty.”

CHAPTER XVII


NOW hearken how the Fox began. In the beginning he appealed Grymbart his dear Cousin, which ever had helped him in his need. He did so because his words should be the better believed; and that he further might the better lie on his enemies. Thus began he first and said:

“My lord, my father had found King Ermeryk's treasure dolven in a pit; and when he had this great good, he was so proud and orguillous that he had all other beasts in despite which before had been his fellows. He made Tybert the Cat to go into that wild land of Ardenne to Bruin the Bear for to do him homage, and bade him say, if he would be King that he should come in to Flanders. Bruin the Bear was glad hereof, for he had long desired it, and went forth in to Flanders; where my father received him right friendly. Anon he sent for the wise Grymbart, my nephew, and for Esegrim the Wolf, and for Tybert the Cat. Tho these five came between Gaunt and the thorp called Yfte, there they held their council an whole dark night long. What with the devil's help and craft, and for my father's riches, they concluded and swore there the King's death. Now hearken, and hear this wonder. The four swore upon Esegrim's crown that they should make Bruin a king and a lord, and bring him in the stool at Akon,(1) and set the crown on his head; and if there were any of the King's friends or lineage that would be contrary or against this, him should my father with his good and treasure fordrive, and take from him his might and power.

“It happed so that on a morrowtide early when Grymbart, my nephew, was of wine almost drunk, that he told it to Dame Sloepcade, his wife, in counsel, and bade her keep it secret. But she anon forgot it, and said it forth in confession to my wife upon an heath where they both went a pilgrimage, but she must first swear, by her truth and by the holy Three Kings of Cologne, that for love nor for hate she should never tell it forth, but keep it secret. But she held it not, and kept it no longer secret but till she came to me; and she then told to me all that she heard, but I must keep it in secret. And she told me so many tokens that I felt well it was truth; and for dread and fear my hair stood right up, and my heart became as heavy as lead and as cold as ice. I thought by this a likeness which here aforetime befell to the frosshis(2) which were free and complained that they had none lord nor were not bydwongen,(3) for a comynte(4) without a governor was not good, and they cried to God with a loud voice that he would ordain one that might rule them, this was all that they desired. God heard their request, for it was reasonable, and sent to them a Stork which ate and swallowed them in, as many as he could find; he was alway to them unmerciful. Tho complained they their hurt, but then it was too late; they that were before free and were afraid of nobody are now bound and must obey to strength their king: herefor, you rich and poor, I sorrowed, that it might happen us in likewise.

“Thus, my lord the King, I have had sorrow for you whereof you can me but little thank. I know Bruin the Bear for such a shrew and ravener, wherefore I thought if he were king we should be all destroyed and lost. I know our sovereign lord the King of so high birth, so mighty, so benign and merciful, that I thought truly it had been an evil change for to have a foul stinking thief and to refuse a noble mighty stately Lion; for the Bear has more mad folly in his unthrifty head, and all his ancestors, than any other has. Thus had I in my heart many a sorrow, and thought alway how I might break and foredo my father's false counsel, which of a churl and a traitor and worse than a thief would make a lord and a king. Alway I prayed God that he would keep our King in worship and good health, and grant him long life, but I thought well if my father held his treasure he should with his false fellows well find the way that the King should be deposed and set aside. I was sore bethought how I might best wit(5) where my father's good lay. I awaited at all times as nigh as I could, in woods, in bushes, in fields; where my father laid his eyes; were it by night or by day, cold or wet, I was alway by him to espy and know where his treasure was laid.

“On a time I lay down all plat on the ground and saw my father come running out of an hole. Now hark what I saw him do. When he came out of the hole, he looked fast about if anybody had seen him. And when he could nowhere none see, he stopped the hole with sand and made it even and plain like to the other ground by. He knew not that I saw it. And where his footspore stood, there stryked he with his tail, and made it smooth with his mouth, that no man should espy it. That learned I there of my false father, and many subtleties that I before knew nothing of. Then departed he thence and ran to the village ward for to do his things; and I forgot not, but sprang and leapt to the hole ward, and how well that he had supposed that he had made all fast I was not so much a fool but that I found the hole well, and scratched and scraped with my feet the sand out of the hole, and crept therein. There found I the most plenty of silver and of gold that ever I saw. Here is none so old that ever so much saw on one heap in all his life. Tho took I Ermelyne my wife to help, and we nor rested night nor day to bear and carry away, with great labour and pain, this rich treasure in to another place that lay for us better, under an hawe in a deep hole. In the mean while that my housewife and I thus laboured, my father was with them that would betray the King. Now may you hear what they did. Bruin the Bear and Esegrim the Wolf sent all the land about if any man would take wages that they should come to Bruin and he would pay them their souldyou or wages before. My father ran all over the land and bare the letters. He wist little that he was robbed of his treasure; yea though he might have wonnen all the world, he had not conne find a penny thereof.

“When my father had been over all in the land between the Elbe and the Somme, and had gotten many a soldier that should the next summer have come to help Bruin, tho came he again to the Bear and his fellows, and told them in how great a venture he had be before the boroughs in the land of Saxon, and how the hunters daily ridden and hunted with hounds after him in such wise that he uneasily escaped with his life. When he had told this to these four false traitors, then showed he them letters that pleased much. To Bruin therein were written twelve hundred of Esegrim's lineage by name, without the bears, the foxes, the cats, and the dassen, all these had sworn that with the first messenger that should come for them they should be ready, and come for to help the Bear if they had their wages a month before. This aspied I, I thank God. After these words my father went to the hole where his treasure had lain, and would look upon it. Tho began he a great sorrow; that he sought he found nothing. He found his hole broken, and his treasure borne away. There did he that I may well sorrow and bewail, for great anger and sorrow he went and hung himself. Thus abode the treason of Bruin by my subtilty after. Now see my infortune. These traitors Esegrim and Bruin are now most privy of counsel about the King, and sit by him on the high bench. And I, poor Reynart, have nor thanks nor reward. I have buried my own father, because the King should have his life. My lord,”said the Fox,“where are they that would so do, that is, to destroy them self for to keep you.”

The King and the Queen hoped to win the treasure and without council took to them Reynart and prayed him that he would do so well as to tell them where this treasure was.

Reynart said,“How should I tell the King, or them that would hang me for love of the traitors and murderers which by their flattery would fain bring me to death? Should I tell to them where my good is, then were I out of my wit.”

The Queen then spake,“Nay, Reynart, the King shall let you have your life, and shall altogether forgive you, and you shall be from henceforth wise and true to my lord.”

The Fox answered to the Queen,“Dear lady, if the King will believe me, and that he will pardon and forgive me all my old trespasses, there was never King so rich as I shall make him. For the treasure that I shall do him have is right costly and may not be numbered.”

The King said,“Ach Dame, will you believe the Fox? Save your reverence, he is born to rob, steal, and to lie. This cleaves to his bones, and can not be had out of the flesh.”

The Queen said,“Nay, my lord, you may now well believe him. Though he were before fell, he is now changed otherwise than he was. You have well heard that he has impeached his father and the Dasse his nephew, which he might well have laid on other beasts if he would have been false, fell, and a liar.”

The King said,“Dame, will you then have it so, and think you it best to be don, though I supposed it should hurt me I will take all these trespasses of Reynart upon me and believe his words. But I swear by my crown, if he ever hereafter misdo and trespass, that shall he dear abyou and all his lineage unto the ninth degree.”

The Fox looked on the King stoundmele,(6) and was glad in his heart, and said,“My lord, I were not wise if I should say things that were not true.”

The King took up a straw from the ground, and pardoned and forgave the Fox all the misdeeds and trespasses of his father and of him also. If the Fox was tho merry and glad, it was no wonder; for he was quit of his death and was all free and frank of all his enemies. The Fox said,“My Lord the king and noble Lady the Queen, God reward you this great worship that you do to me. I shall think and also thank you for it in such wise that you shall be the richest king of the world; for there is none living under the sun that I vouchsafe better my treasure on, than on you both.”

Then took the Fox up a straw and proffered it to the King, and said,“My most dear Lord, please it you to receive here the rich treasure which King Ermeryk had. For I give it unto you with a free will, and knowledge it openly.”

The King received the straw, and threw it merely from him with a joyous visage, and thanked much the Fox.

The Fox laughed in himself.

The King then hearkened after the counsel of the Fox. And all that there were were at his will.

“My Lord,”said he,“hearken and mark well my words. In the west side of Flanders there stands a wood and is named Hulsterlo, and a water that is called Krekenpyt lies thereby. This is so great a wilderness, that oft in a whole year man nor wife comes therein, save they that will, and they that will not eschew it. There lies this treasure hidden. Understand well that the place is called Krekenpyt, for I advise you, for the least hurt, that you and my Lady go both thither; for I know none so true that I durst on your behalf trust; wherefore go yourself. And when you come to Krekenpyt you shall find there two birch trees standing althernext(7) the pit. My Lord, to tho birch trees shall you go: there lies the treasure untherdolven.(8) There must you scrape and dig away a little the moss on the one side. There shall you find many a jewel of gold and silver, and there shall you find the crown which king Ermeryk wore in his days. That should Bruin the Bear have worn, if his will had gone forth. You shall see many a costly jewel, with rich stones set in gold work, which cost many a thousand mark. My Lord the King, when you now have all this good, how oft shall you say in your heart and think,‘Oh how true art thou, Reynart the Fox, that with thy subtle wit delvest and hidest this great treasure! God give thee good hap and welfare wherever thou be!’”

The King said,“Sir Reynart, you must come and help us to dig up this treasure. I know not the way. I should never conne find it. I have heard often named Paris, London, Aachen, and Cologne; as me thinks this treasure lies right as you mocked and japed, for you name Krekenpyt. That is a feigned name.”

These words were not good to the Fox, and he said with an angry mood, and dissembled and said,“Yea, my Lord the King, you be also nigh that as from Rome to Maye. Ween you that I will lead you to flume(9) Jordan. Nay, I shall bring you out of weening and show it you by good witness.”

He called loud,“Cuwart the Hare, come here before the King.”The beasts saw all thitherward and wondered what the King would.

The Fox said to the Hare,“Cuwart, are you acold; how tremble you and quake so? Be not afraid; and tell my Lord the King here the truth, and that I charge you, by the faith and truth that you owe him and to my Lady the Queen, of such thing as I shall demand of you.”

Cuwart said,“I shall say the truth, though I should lose my neck therefor. I shall not lie, you have charged me so sore, if I know it.”

“Then say, know you not where Krekenpyt stands? Is that in your mind?”

The Hare said,“I knew that well twelve year agone, where that stands. Why ask you that? It stands in a wood named Hulsterlo, upon a warande(10) in the wilderness. I have suffered there much sorrow for hunger and for cold, yea, more than I can tell. Pater Symonet the Friese was woned(11) to make there false money, wherewith he bare himself out and all his fellowship but that was before ere I had fellowship with Ryn the Hound, which made me escape many a danger; as he could well tell if he were here, and that I never in my days trespassed against the King otherwise than I ought to do with right.”

Reynart said to him,“Go again to yonder fellowship. Hear you, Cuwart? My Lord the King desires no more to know of you.”The Hare returned and went again to the place he came from.

The Fox said,“My Lord the King, is it true that I said?”

“Yea, Reynart,”said the King,“forgive it me; I did evil that I believed you not. Now, Reynart, friend, find the way that you go with us to the place and pit where the treasure lies.”

The Fox said,“It is a wonder thing. Ween you that I would not fain go with you; if it were so with me that I might go with you in such wise that it no shame were unto your lordship, I would go. But nay, it may not be. Hearken what I shall say, and must needs, though it be to me villainy and shame. When Esegrim the Wolf, in the devil's name, went into religion and became a monk shorn in the order, tho the provender of six monks was not sufficient to him, and had not enough to eat, he then plained and wailed so sore that I had pity on him, for he became slow and sick. And because he was of my kin, I gave him counsel to run away, and so he did. Wherefore I stand accursed, and am in the Pope's ban and sentence. I will to-morrow betimes, as the sun rises, take my way to Rome for to be assoiled(12) and take pardon. And from Rome I will over the sea into the Holy Land, and will never return again till I have done so much good that I may with worship go with you. It were great reproof to you, my Lord the King, in what land that I accompanied you that men should say you reysed(13) and accompanied yourself with a cursed and person agravate.”

The King said,“Since that you stand accursed in the censures of the Church, if I went with you men should arette villainy unto my crown. I shall then take Cuwart or some other to go with me to Krekenpyt; and I counsel you, Reynart, that you put you yourself out of this curse.”

“My Lord,”quoth the Fox,“therefore will I go to Rome as hastily as I may. I shall not rest by night nor day till I be assoiled.”

“Reynart,”said the King,“me thinks you are turned into a good way. God give you grace to accomplish well your desire.”

As soon as this speaking was done, Noble the King went and stood upon an high stage of stone and commanded silence to all the beasts, and that they should sit down in a ring round upon the grass, everiche in his place after his estate and birth. Reynart the Fox stood by the Queen, whom he ought well to love. Then said the King,“Hear you all that be poor and rich, young and old, that stands here. Reynart, one of the head officers of my house, had done so evil, which this day should have been hanged, has now in this Court done so much, that I and my wife the Queen have promised to him our grace and friendship. The Queen has prayed much for him, insomuch that I have made peace with him. And I give to him his life and member freely again, and I command you upon your life that you do worship to Reynart and his wife, and to his children, wheresomever you meet them by day or night. And I will also hear no more complaints of Reynart. If he has heretofore misdone and trespassed, he will no more misdo nor trespass, but now better him. He will to-morrow early go to the Pope for pardon and forgiveness of all his sins, and forth over the sea to the Holy Land, and he will not come again till he bring pardon of all his sins.”

This tale heard Tyselyn the Raven and leapt to Esegrim to Bruin and to Tybert, there as they were, and said,“You caitifs, how goes it now? You unhappy folk, what do you here? Reynart the Fox is now a squire and a courtier, and right great and mighty in the Court. The King has skylled him quite of all his brokes,(14) and forgiven him all his trespasses and misdeeds. And you be all betrayed and appeached.”

Esegrim said,“How may this be? I think Tyselyn that you lie.”

“I do not, certainly,”said the Raven.

Tho went the Wolf and the Bear to the King. Tybert the Cat was in great sorrow, and he was so sore afraid that for to have the Fox's friendship he would well forgive Reynart the loss of his one eyou that he lost in the priest's house, he was so woe he wist not what to do, he would well that he never had seen the Fox.

CHAPTER XVIII


Esegrim came proudly over the field before the King, and he thanked the Queen, and spake with a fell mood ill words on the Fox, in suchwise that the King heard it and was wroth, and made the Wolf and the Bear anon to be arrested. You saw never wood(1) dogs do more harm than was done to them. They were both fast bounden, so sore that all that night they might not stir hand nor foot. They might scarcely roar nor move any joint. Now hear how the Fox forth did. He hated them. He laboured so to the Queen that he got leave for to have as much of the Bear's skin upon his rigge(2) as a foot long and a foot broad, for to make him thereof a scrip; then was the Fox ready if he had four strong shoon. Now hear how he did for to get these shoon. He said to the Queen,“Madam, I am your pilgrim. Here is my Eme, Sir Esegrim, that has four strong shoon which were good for me. If he would let me have two of them I would on the way busily think on your soul, for it is right that a pilgrim should always think and pray for them that do him good. Thus may you do your soul good if you will. And also if you might get of my aunt Dame Ersewynde also two of her shoon to give me, she may well do it, for she goes but little out, but abides alway at home.”

Then said the Queen,“Reynart, you behoves well such shoes; you may not be without them. They shall be good for you to keep your feet whole for to pass with them many a sharp mountain and stony rocks. You can find no better shoes for you than such as Esegrim and his wife have and wear. They be good and strong. Though it should touch their life, each of them shall give you two shoes for to accomplish with your high pilgrimage.”

CHAPTER XIX


THUS has this false pilgrim gotten from Esegrim two shoes from his feet, which were hauled off the claws to the sinews. You saw never fowl that men roasted lay so still as Esegrim did when his shoes were hauled off. He stirred not, and yet his feet bled. Then when Esegrim was unshod tho must Dame Ersewynde his wife lie down in the grass with an heavy cheer. And she lost there her hinder shoes.

Tho was the Fox glad, and said to his Aunt in scorn,“My dear Aunt, how much sorrow have you suffered for my sake, which me sore repents, save this, hereof I am glad for you be the liefest(1) of all my kin. Therefore I will gladly wear your shoes. You shall be partner of my pilgrimage and deal of the pardon that I shall with your shoes fetch over the sea.”

Dame Ersewynde was so woe that she uneasily might speak. Nevertheless this she said,“Ah, Reynart, that you now all thus have your will, I pray God to wreak(2) it!”

Esegrim and his fellow the Bear held their peace and were all still. They were evil at ease for they were bound and sore wounded. Had Tybert the Cat have been there, he should also somewhat have suffered, in such wise as he should not have escaped thence without hurt or shame.

The next day, when the sun arose, Reynart then did grease his shoes which he had of Esegrim and Ersewynde his wife, and did them on, and bound them to his feet, and went to the King and to the Queen and said to them with a glad cheer,“Noble Lord and Lady, God give you good morrow, and I desire of your grace that I may have male(3) and staff blessed as belongs to a pilgrim.”

Then the King anon sent for Bellyn the Ram, and when he came he said,“Sir Bellyn, you shall do mass before Reynart, for he shall go on pilgrimage; and give to him male and staff.”

The Ram answered again and said,“My Lord, I dare not do that, for he has said that he is in the Pope's curse.”

The King said what thereof master Gelys has said to us, if a man had don as many sins as all the world and he would tho sins forsake, shrive him and receive penance, and do by the priest's counsel, God will forgive them and be merciful unto him. Now will Reynart go over the sea into the Holy Land, and make him clear of all his sins.

Then answered Bellyn to the King,“I will not do little nor much herein but if you save me harmless in the spiritual court, before the bishop Prendelor and before his archdeacon Looswinde and before Sir Rapiamus his official.”

The King began to wax wroth, and said,“I shall not bid you so much in half a year! I had liever hang you than I should so much pray you for it!”

When the Ram saw that the King was angry, he was so sore afraid that he quoke for fear, and went to the altar and sang in his books and read such as him thought good over Reynart, which little set thereby save that he would have the worship thereof.

When Bellyn the Ram had all said his service devoutly, then he hung on the fox's neck a male covered with the skin of Bruin the Bear and a little psalter thereby. Tho was Reynart ready toward his journey. Tho looked he toward the King, as he had been sorrowful to depart; and feigned as he had wept, right as he had yamerde(4) in his heart; but if he had any sorrow it was because all the other that were there were not in the same plight as the Wolf and Bear were brought in by him. Nevertheless he stood and prayed them all to pray for him, like as he would pray for them. The Fox thought that he tarried long and would fain have departed, for he knew himself guilty.

The King said,“Reynart, I am sorry you be so hasty, and will no longer tarry.”

“Nay, my Lord, it is time, for we ought not spare to do well, I pray you to give me leave to depart: I must do my pilgrimage.”

The King said,“God be with you,”and commanded all them of the court to go and convey Reynart on his way, save the Wolf and the Bear which fast lay bounden. There was none that durst be sorry therefor, and if you had seen Reynart how personably he went with his male and psalter on his shoulder, and the shoes on his feet, you should have laughed. He went and showed him outward wisely, but he laughed in his heart that all they brought him forth which had a little before been with him so wroth. And also the King which so much hated him, he had made him such a fool that he brought him to his owne intent. He was a pilgrim of deuce ace.

“My Lord the King,”said the Fox,“I pray you to return again, I will not that you go any further with me. You might have harm thereby. You have there two murderers arrested. If they escape you, you might be hurt by them. I pray God keep you from misadventure!”With these words he stood up on his afterfeet, and prayed all the beasts, great and small, that would be partners of his pardon, that they should pray for him.

They said that they all would remember him.

Then departed he from the King so heavily that many of them ermed.(5)

Then said he to Cuwart the Hare and to Bellyn the Ram merrily,“Here, friends, shall we now depart? Yea, with a good will accompany me further. You two made me never angry. You be good for to walk with, courteous, friendly, and not complained on of any beast You be of good conditions and ghostly of your living; you live both as I did when I was a recluse. If you have leaves and grass you be pleased, you reck not of bread of flesh nor such manner meat.”

With such flattering words has Reynart these two flattered that they went with him till they came before his house Maleperdays.

CHAPTER XX


WHEN the Fox was come before the gate of his house, he said to Bellyn the Ram,“Cousin, you shall abide here without, I and Cuwart will go in, for I will pray Cuwart to help me to take my leave of Ermelyne my wife, and to comfort her and my children.”

Bellyn said,“I pray him to comfort them well.”

With such flattering words brought he the Hare into his hole in an evil hour. There found they Dame Ermelyne lying on the ground with her younglings, which had sorrowed much for dread of Reynart's death. But when she saw him come, she was glad. But when she saw his male and psalter, and espied his shoes, she marvelled and said,“Dear Reynart, how have you sped?”

He said“I was arrested in the court, but the King let me gon. I must go a pilgrimage. Bruin the Bear and Esegrim the Wolf they be pledge for me. I thank the King he has given to us Cuwart here, for to do with him what we will. The King said himself that Cuwart was the first that on us complained, and by the faith that I owe you I am right wroth on Cuwart.”

When Cuwart heard these words he was sore afraid. He would have fled but he might not, for the Fox stood between him and the gate, and he caught him by the neck. Tho cried the Hare,“Help, Bellyn, help! Where be you? This pilgrim slays me?”But that cry was soon done, for the Fox had anon bitten his throat a two.

Tho said he,“Let us go eat this good fat hare.”The young whelps came also. Thus held they a great feast, for Cuwart had a good fat body. Ermelyne ate the flesh and drank the blood; she thanked oft the King that he had made them so merry. The Fox said,“Eat as much as you may, he will pay for it if we will fetch it.”She said,“Reynart, I think you mock. Tell me the truth how you be departed thence.”

“Dame, I have so flattered the king and the queen that I suppose the friendship between us shall be right thin. When he shall know of this he shall be angry, and hastily seek me for to hang me by my neck. Therefore let us depart, and steal secretly away in some other forest where we may live without fear and dread, and there that we may live seven year and more an they find us not. There is plenty of good meat of partridges, woodcocks, and much other wild fowl, Dame, and if you will come with me thither there are sweet wells and fair and clear running brooks; Lord God, how sweet air is there. There may we be in peace and ease, and live in great wealth. For the King has let me gon because I told him that there was great treasure in Krekenpyt, but there shall he find nothing though he sought ever. This shall sore anger him when he knows that he is thus deceived. What! think you how many a great leasing must I lie ere I could escape from him. It was hard that I escaped out of prison; I was never in greater peril nor nearer my death. But how it ever go I shall by my will never more come in the King's danger. I have now gotten my thumb out of his mouth, that thank I my subtilty.”

Dame Ermelyne said,“Reynart, I counsel that we go not into another forest where we should be strange and elenge. We have here all that we desire. And you be here lord of our neighbours; wherefore shall we leave this place and adventure us in a worse? We may abide here sure enough. If the King would do us any harm or besiege us, here are so many by or side holes, in such wise as we shall escape from him; in abiding here we may not do amiss. We know all bypaths over all, and ere he take us with might he must have much help thereto. But that you have sworn that you shall go oversea and abide there, that is the thing that touches me most.”

“Nay, Dame, care not therefor. How more forsworn, how more forlorn. I went once with a good man that said to me that a bedwongen(1) oath, or oath sworn by force, was none oath. Though I went on this pilgrimage it should not avail me a cat's tail. I will abide here and follow your counsel. If the King hunt after me, I shall keep me as well as I may. If he be me too mighty, yet I hope with subtlety to beguile him. I shall unbind my sack. If he will seek harm he shall find harm.”

Now was Bellyn the Ram angry that Cuwart his fellow was so long in the hole, and called loud,“Come out, Cuwart, in the devil's name; how long shall Reynart keep you there? Haste you, and come! Let us go.”

When Reynart heard this, he went out and said softly to Bellyn the Ram,“Lief Bellyn, wherefore be you angry? Cuwart speaks with his dear Aunt. Methinks you ought not to be displeased therefor. He bade me say to you you might well go before, and he shall come after; he is lighter of foot than you. He must tarry awhile with his Aunt and her children, they weep and cry because I shall go from them.”

Bellyn said,“What did Cuwart? Methought he cried after help.”

The Fox answered,“What say you, Bellyn? Ween you that he should have any harm? Now hark what he then did. When we were come into my house, and Ermelyne my wife understood that I should go over sea, she fell down in a swoon; and when Cuwart saw that, he cried loud,‘Bellyn, come help my Aunt to bring her out of her swoon.’”

Then said the Ram,“In faith I understood that Cuwart had been in great danger.”

The Fox said,“Nay truly, or Cuwart should have any harm in my house I had liever that my wife and children should suffer much hurt.”

CHAPTER XXI


THE Fox said,“Bellyn, remember you not that yesterday the King and his council commanded me that ere I should depart out of this land I should send to him two letters? Dear cousin, I pray you to bear them, they be ready written.”

The Ram said,“I wot never. If I wist that your inditing and writing were good, you might peradventure so much pray me that I would bear them, if I had anything to bear them in.”

Reynart said,“You shall not fail to have somewhat to bear them in. Rather than they should be unborne I shall rather give you my male that I bear; and put the King's letters therein, and hang them about your neck. You shall have of the King great thanks therefor, and be right welcome to him.”

Hereupon Bellyn promised him to bear these letters.

Tho returned Reynart into his house and took the male and put therein Cuwart's head, and brought it to Bellyn for to bring him in danger, and hang it on his neck, and charged him not to look in the male if he would have the King's friendship.“And if you will that the King take you into his grace and love you, say that you yourself have made the letter and indited it, and have given the counsel that it is so well made and written. You shall have great thanks therefor.”

Bellyn the Ram was glad hereof, and thought he should have great thanks, and said,“Reynart, I wot well that you now do for me. I shall be in the Court greatly praised when it is known that I can indite and make a letter, though I cannot make it. Often it happens that God suffers some to have worship and thank of the labours and cunning of other men, and so it shall befall me now. Now, what counsel you, Reynart? Shall Cuwart the Hare come with me to the Court?”

“Nay,”said the Fox,“he shall anon follow you. He may not yet come, for he must speak with his Aunt. Now go you forth before. I shall show to Cuwart secret things which are not yet known.”

Bellyn said,“Farewell, Reynart,”and went him forth to the Court. And he ran and hasted so fast, that he came before midday to the Court, and found the King in his palace with his Barons. The King marvelled when he saw him bring the male again which was made of the Bear's skin. The King said,“Say on, Bellyn, from whence come you? Where is the Fox? How is it that he has not the male with him?”

Bellyn said,“My Lord, I shall say you all that I know. I accompanied Reynart unto his house. And when he was ready, he asked me if I that would for your sake bear two letters to you. I said, for to do you pleasure and worship, I would gladly bear to you seven. Tho brought he to me this male wherein the letters be, which are indited by my cunning, and I gave counsel of the making of them. I think you saw never letters better nor craftlier made nor indited.”

The King commanded anon Bokart, his secretary, to read the letters, for he understood all manner languages. Tybert the Cat and he took the male off Bellyn's neck, and Bellyn has so far said and confessed that he therefore was dampned.(1)

The clerk Bokwart undid the male, and drew out Cuwart's head, and said,“Alas, what letters are these! Certainly, my Lord, this is Cuwart's head.”

“Alas,”said the King,“that ever I believed so the Fox!”There might men see great heaviness of the King and of the Queen. The King was so angry that he held long down his head, and at last, after many thoughts, he made a great cry, that all the beasts were afraid of the noise.

Tho spake Sir Firapeel the Leopard, which was sybbe(2) somewhat to the King, and said,“Sire King, how make you such a noise! You make sorrow enough though the Queen were dead. Let this sorrow go, and make good cheer. It is great shame. Be you not a Lord and King of this land? Is it not all under you, that here is?”

The King said,“Sir Firapeel, how should I suffer this? One false shrew and deceiver has betrayed me and brought me so far, that I have forwrought(3) and angered my friends the stout Bruin the Bear and Esegrim the Wolf, which sore me repents. And this goes against my worship, that I have done amiss against my best Barons, and that I trusted and believed so much the false Fox. And my wife is cause thereof. She prayed me so much that I heard her prayer, and that me repents, though it be too late.”

“What though, Sir King,”said the Leopard.“If there be any thing misdone it shall be amended. We shall give to Bruin the Bear to Esegrim the Wolf and to Ersewynde his wife for the piece of his skin and for their shoes, for to have good peace, Bellyn the Ram. For he has confessed himself that he gave counsel and consented to Cuward's death. It is reason that he abyou it. And we all shall go fetch Reynart, and we shall arrest him and hang him by the neck, without law or judgment. And there with all shall be content.”

CHAPTER XXII


THE King said,“I will do it gladly.”

Firapeel the Leopard went tho to the prison and unbound them first, and then he said,“You, sirs, I bring to you a fast pardon and my lord's love and friendship. It repents him, and is sorry, that he ever has done spoken or trespassed against you, and therefore you shall have a good appointment. And also amends he shall give to you, Bellyn the Ram and all his lineage fro now further to doomsday, in such wise that wheresomever you find them, in field or in wood, that you may freely bite and eat them without any forfeit. And also the King grants to you that you may hunt and do the worst you can to Reynart and all his lineage without misdoing. This fair great privilege will the King grant to you ever to hold of him. And the King will that you swear to him never to misdo, but do him homage and fealty. I counsel you to do this, for you may do it honourably.”

Thus was the peace made by Firapeel the Leopard, friendly and well. And that cost Bellyn the Ram his tabart(1) and also his life, and the Wolf's lineage hold these privileges of the King. And in to this day they devour and eat Bellyn's lineage where that they may find them. This debate was begun in an evil time, for the peace could never sith(2) be made between them.

The King did forth with his Court and feast length twelve days longer for love of the Bear and the Wolf, so glad was he of the making of this peace.

CHAPTER XXIII


TO this great feast came all manner of beasts, for the King did do cry this feast over all in that land. There was the most joy and mirth that ever was seen among beasts. There was danced mannerly the hovedance,(1) with shalms, trumpets, and all manner of minstrelsy. The King did do ordain so much meat that everych found enough. And there was no beast in all his land so great nor so little but he was there, and there were many fowls and birds also, and all they that desired the King's friendship were there, saving Reynart the Fox, the red false pilgrim which lay in await to do harm and thought it was not good for him to be there. Meat and drink flowed there. There were plays and esbatemens. The feast was full of melody. One might have lust to see such a feast.

And right as the feast had dured eight days, about mid-day came in the Cony Lapreel before the King, where he sat on the table with the Queen, and said all heavily that all they heard him that were there,“My lord, have pity on my complaint, which is of great force and murder that Reynart the Fox would have done to me yester morrow as I came running by his borugh at Maleperdays. He stood before his door without, like a pilgrim. I supposed to have passed by him peaceably toward this feast, and when he saw me come he came against me saying his beads. I saluted him, but he spake not one word, but he raught out his right foot and dubbed me in the neck between my ears that I had weened I should have lost my head, but God be thanked I was so light that I sprang from him. With much pain came I off his claws. He grimmed as he had been angry by cause he held me no faster. Tho I escaped from him I lost my one ear, and I had four great holes in my head of his sharp nails that the blood sprang out and that I was nigh all aswoon, but for the great fear of my life I sprang and ran so fast from him that he could not overtake me. See, my Lord these great wounds that he has made to me with his sharp long nails. I pray you to have pity of me, and that you will punish this false traitor and murderer, or else shall there no man go and come over the heath in safety whiles he haunts his false and shrewd rule.”

CHAPTER XXIV


RIGHT as the Cony had made an end of his complaint, came in Corbant the Rook flowen in the place before the King and said,“Dear Lord, hear me. I bring you here a piteous complaint. I went to-day by the morrow(1) with Sharpebek my wife for to play upon the heath. And there lay Reynart the Fox down on the ground, like a dead caitiff. His eyes stared and his tongue hung long out of his mouth, like an hound had been dead. We tasted(2) and felt his belly but we found thereon no life. Tho went my wife and hearkened, and laid her ear before his mouth for to wit if he drew his breath, which misfell her evil: For the false fell Fox awaited well his time, and when he saw her so nigh him he caught her by the head and bit it off. The was I in great sorrow and cried loud,‘Alas! alas! what is there happened?’Then stood he hastily up and raught so covetously after me that for fear of death I trembled, and flew upon a tree thereby, and saw from far how the false caitiff ate and slonked(3) her in, so hungrily that he left neither flesh nor bone, no more but a few feathers. The small feathers he slang them in with the flesh; he was so hungry, he would well have eaten two. Tho went he his strete. Tho flew I down with great sorrow, and gathered up the feathers for to show them to you here. I would not be again in such peril and fear as I was there for a thousand mark of the finest gold that ever came of Araby. My Lord the King, see here this piteous work. These are the feathers of Sharpebek my wife! My Lord, if you will have worship you must do herefor justice, and avenge you in such wise as men may fear and hold of you, for if you suffer thus your safe conduct to be broken, you yourself shall not go peaceably in the highway. For the lords that do not justice, and suffer that the law be not executed upon the thieves, murderers, and them that misdo, they be partners before God of all their misdeeds and trespasses, and eueryche then will be a lord himself. Dear Lord see well to, for to keep yourself.”

CHAPTER XXV


NOBLE the King was sore moved and angry when he had heard these complaints of the Cony and of the Rook. He was so frightful to look on that his eyes glimmered as fire; he brayed as loud as a bull, in such wise that all the Court quoke for fear; at the last he said, crying,“By my crown, and by the truth that I owe to my wife, I shall so awreak and avenge these trespasses that it shall be long spoken of after. That my safe conduct and my commandment is thus broken, I was over nice that I believed so lightly the false shrew. His false flattering speech deceived me. He told me he would go to Rome, and from thence over the sea to the Holy Land. I gave him male and psalter, and made of him a pilgrim, and meant all truth. Oh, what false touches can he! How can he stuff the sleeve with flocks! But this caused my wife. It was all by her counsel. I am not the first that have been deceived by women's counsel, by which many a great hurt has befallen. I pray and command all them that hold of me, and desire my friendship, be they here or wheresomever they be, that they with their counsel and deeds help me to avenge this over great trespass, that we and ours may abide in honour and worship and this false thief in shame. That he no more trespass against our safeguard, I will myself in my person help thereto all that I may.”

Esegrim the Wolf and Bruin the Bear heard well the King's words, and hoped well to be avenged on Reynart the Fox, but they durst not speak one word. The King was so sore moved that none durst well speak.

At last the Queen spake,“Sire, pour dieu no croyes myou toutes choses que on vous dye, et nor Iures pas legierment. A man of worship should not lightly believe, nor swear greatly, unto the time he knew the matter clearly; and also he ought by right hear that other party speak. There are many that complain on other and are in the default themself. Audi alteram partem: hear that other party. I have truly holden the Fox for good, and upon that that he meant no falsehood I helped him that I might. But howsomever it comes or goes, is he evil or good, me thinks for your worship that you should not proceed against him over hastily. That were not good nor honest, for he may not escape from you. You may prison him or flay him, he must obey your judgment.”

Then said Firapeel the Leopard,“My Lord, me thinks my Lady here has said to you truth and given you good counsel; do you well and follow her, and take advice of your wise council. And if he be founden guilty in the trespasses that now to you be showed, let him be sore punished according to his trespasses. And if he come not hither ere this feast be ended, and excuse him as he ought of right to do, then do as the council shall advise you. But and if he were twice as much false and ill as he is, I would not counsel that he should be done to more than right.”

Esegrim the Wolf said,“Sir Firapeel, all we agree to the same; as far as it pleases my lord the King, it cannot be better. But though Reynart were now here, and he cleared him of double so many plaints, yet should I bring forth against him that he had forfeited his life. But I will now be still and say not, because he is not present. And yet, above all this, he has told the King of certain treasure lying in Krekenpyt in Hulsterlo. There was never lied a greater leasing; therewith he has us all beguiled, and has sore hindered me and the Bear. I dare lay my life thereon that he said not thereof a true word. Now robbs he and steals upon the heath all that goes forth by his house. Nevertheless, Sir Firapeel, what that pleases the King and you that must well be done. But and if he would have come hither he might have been here, for he had knowledge by the King's messenger.”

The King said,“We will none otherwise send for him, but I command all them that owe me service and will my honour and worship that they make them ready to the war at the end of six days, all them that are archers and have bows, guns, bombards, horsemen and footmen, that all these be ready to besiege Maleperdays. I shall destroy Reynart the Fox if I be a king. You lords and sirs, what say you hereto? Will you do this with a good will?”

And they said and cried all,“Yea we, Lord, when that you will, we shall all go with you!”





CHAPTER XXVI


ALL these words heard Grymbart the Dasse, which was his brother son. He was sorry and angry. If it might have profited he ran then the highway to Maleperdays ward. He spared neither bush nor hawe, but he hasted so sore that he sweat. He sorrowed in himself for Reynart his rede Eme, and as he went he said to himself,“Alas, in what danger be you come in! Where shall you become! Shall I see you brought from life to death, or else exiled out of the land! Truly I may be well sorrowful, for you be head of all our lineage; you be wise of council, you be ready to help your friends when they have need, you can so well show your reasons that where you speak you win all.”

With such manner wailing and piteous words came Grymbart to Maleperdays, and found Reynart his Eme there standing, which had gotten two pigeons as they came first out of their nest to assay if they could fly, and because the feathers on their wings were too short they fell down to the ground; and as Reynart was gone out to seek his meat he espied them and caught them, and was come home with them.

And when he saw Grymbart coming, he tarried and said,“Welcome, my best beloved Nephew that I know in all my kindred. You have run fast, you are all besweat; have you any new tidings?”

“Alas,”said he,“lief Eme, it stands evil with you. You have lost both life and good. The King has sworn that he shall give you a shameful death. He has commanded all his folk within six days for to be here. Archers, footmen, horsemen, and people in wains! And he has guns, bombards, tents, and pavilions. And also he has do laden torches. See before you, for you have need. Esegrim and Bruin are better now with the King than I am with you. All that they will is done. Esegrim has don him to understand that you be a thief and a murderer; he has great envy to you. Lapreel the Cony, and Corbant the Rook have made a great complaint also. I sorrow much for your life, that for dread I am all sick.”

“Puf!”said the Fox.“Dear Nephew, is there nothing else? Be you so sore afraid hereof ? Make good cheer hardily. Though the King himself and all that are in the Court has sworn my death, yet shall I be exalted above them all. They may all fast jangle, clatter, and give counsel, but the Court may not prosper without me and my wiles and subtlety.”





CHAPTER XXVI


“DEAR Nephew, let all these things pass, and come here in and see what I shall give you; a good pair of fat pigeons. I love no meat better. They are good to digest. They may almost be swolowen in all whole; the bones are half blood; I eat them with that other. I feel myself other while encumbered in my stomach, therefore eat I gladly light meat. My wife Ermelyne shall receive us friendly, but tell her nothing of this thing for she should take it over heavily. She is tender of heart; she might for fear fall in some sickness; a little thing goes sore to her heart. And to-morrow early I will go with you to the Court, and if I may come to speech and may be heard, I shall so answer that I shall touch some nigh ynowh. Nephew, will not you stand by me as a friend ought to do to another?”

“Yes truly, dear Eme,”said Grymbart,“and all my good is at your commandment.”

“God thank you, Nephew,”said the Fox.“That is well said: If I may live, I shall quite it you.”

“Eme,”said Grymbart,“you may well come before all the lords and excuse you. There shall none arrest you nor hold as long as you be in your words. The Queen and the Leopard have gotten that.”

Then said the Fox,“Therefor I am glad; then I care not for the best of them an hair; I shall well save myself.”

They spoke no more hereof, but went forth into the burrow, and found Ermelyne there sitting by her younglings, which arose up anon and received them friendly. Grymbart saluted his aunt and the children with friendly words. The two pigeons were made ready for their supper, which Reynart had taken. Each of them took his part, as far as it would stretch; if each of them had had one more there should but little have left over. The Fox said,“Lief Nephew, how like you my children Rossel and Reynerdine? They shall do worship to all our lineage. They begin already to do well. That one catches well a chicken, and that other a pullet. They conne well also duck in the water after lapwings and ducks. I would oft send them for provender, but I will first teach them how they shall keep them from the grynnes, from the hunters, and from the hounds. If they were so far come that they were wise, I durst well trust to them that they should well victual us in many good divers meats that we now lack. And they like and follow me well, for they play all grimming, and where they hate they look friendly and merrily; for thereby they bring them under their feet, and bite the throat asunder. This is the nature of the Fox. They be swift in their taking, which pleases me well.”

“Eme,”said Grymbart,“you may be glad that you have such wise children. And I am glad of them also because they be of my kin.”

“Grymbart,”said the Fox,“you have sweat and be weary. It were high tide that you were at your rest.”

“Eme, if it pleases you, it thinks me good.”Tho lay they down on a litter made of straw. The Fox his wife and his children went all to sleep, but the Fox was all heavy and lay, sighed, and sorrowed(1) how he might best excuse himself.

On the morrow early he roomed(2) his castle and went with Grymbart. But he took leave first of Dame Ermelyne his wife and of his children, and said,“Think not long. I must go to the Court with Grymbart, my cousin. If I tarry somewhat, be not afraid; and if you hear any ill tidings, take it alway for the best. And see well to yourself and keep our castle well. I shall do yonder the best I can, after that I see how it goes.”

“Alas, Reynart,”said she,“how have you now thus taken upon you for to go to the Court again? The last time that you were there, you were in great jeopardy of your life. And you said you would never come there more.”

“Dame,”said the Fox,“the adventure of the world is wonderly; it goes otherwhile by weening. Many one weens to have a thing which he must forego. I must needs now go thither. Be content. It is all without dread. I hope to come at altherlengest within five days again.”

Herewith he departed; and went with Grymbart to the Court ward. And when they were upon the heath, then said Reynart,“Nephew, since I was last shriven I have done many shrewd turns. I would you would hear me now of all that I have trespassed in: I made the Bear to have a great wound for the male which was cut out of his skin; and also I made the Wolf and his wife to lose their shoon; I peased(3) the King with great leasings, and bare him on hand that the Wolf and the Bear would have betrayed him and would have slain him, so I made the King right wroth with them where they deserved it not; also I told to the King that there was great treasure in Hulsterlo of which he was never the better nor richer, for I lied all that I said; I led Bellyn the Ram and Cuwart the Hare with me, and slew Cuwart and sent to the King by Bellyn Cuwart's head in scorn; and I dowed(4) the Cony between the ears that almost I benamme(5) his life from him, for he escaped against my will, he was to me overswift; the Rook may well complain for I swallowed in Dame Sharpebek his wife. And also I have forgotten one thing, the last time that I was shriven to you, which I have since bethought me; and it was of great deceit that I did; which I now will tell you. I came with the Wolf walking between Houthulst and Elverdynge. There saw we go a red mare, and she had a black colt or a foal of four months old which was good and fat. Esegrim was almost storven for hunger, and prayed me go to the Mare and wit of her if she would sell her foal.

“I ran fast to the Mare and asked that of her. She said she would sell it for money.

“I demanded of her, how she would sell it.

“She said,‘It is written on my hinder foot. If you can read and be a clerk you may come see and read it.’

“Tho wist I well where she would be, and I said,‘Nay, for sooth, I cannot read. And also I desire not to buy your child. Esegrim has sent me hither, and would fain know the price thereof.’

“The Mare said,‘Let him come then himself, and I shall let him have knowledge.’

“I said,‘I shall;’and hastily went to Esegrim, and said,‘Eme will you eat your bellyful of this colt, so go fast to the Mare for she tarries after you. She has do write the price of her colt under her foot. She would that I should have read it, but I can not one letter, which me sore repents for I went never to school. Eme will you buy that colt? Can you read, so may you buy it.’

“‘Oh, Nephew, that can I well. What should me let? I can well French, Latin, English, and Dutch. I have gone to school at Oxenford, I have also with old and ancient doctors been in the audience and heard pleas, and also have given sentence, I am licensed in both laws; what manner writing that any man can devise I can read it as perfectly as my name: I will go to her, and shall anon understand the price,’and he bade me to tarry for him, and he ran to the Mare, and asked her how she would sell her foal or keep it. She said,‘The sum of the money stands written after on my foot.’He said,‘Let me read it.’She said,‘Do,’and lifte up her foot, which was new shod with iron and six strong nails; and she smote him, without missing, on his head, that he fell down as he had been dead. A man should well have ridden a mile ere he arose. The Mare trotted away with her colt, and she left Esegrim lying shrewdly hurt and wounded. He lay and bled, and howled as an hound. I went tho to him and said,‘Sir Esegrim, dear Eme, how is it now with you? Have you eaten yenowh of the colt? Is your belly full? Why give you me no part? I did your errand. Have slept you your dinner? I pray you tell me, what was written under the mare's foot? What was it, prose or rhyme, metre or verse? I would fain know it. I think it was cantum, for I heard you sing, me thought, from fear; for you were so wise that no man could read it better than you.’

“‘Alas, Reynart, alas!’said the Wolf,‘I pray you to leave your mocking. I am so foul arrayed and sore hurt than an heart of stone might have pity on me. The Mare with her long leg had an iron foot, I weened the nails thereof had been letters, and she hit me at the first stroke six great wounds in my head that almost it is cloven. Such manner letters shall I never more desire to read.’‘Dear Eme, is that truth that you tell me? I have great mervaylle. I held you for one of the wisest clerks that now live. Now I hear well it is true that I long since have read and heard, that the best clerks are not the wisest men. The lay people otherwhile wax wise. The cause that these clerks are not the wisest is that they study so much in the cunning and science that they therein doole.’Thus brought I Esegrim in this great laste and harm, that he vnneth byhelde his life.

“Lief Nephew now have I told you all my sins that I remember. Whatsoever fallen at the Court—I wote never how it shall stand with me there—I am not now so sore afraid, for I am clear from sin. I will gladly come to mercy and receive penance by your counsel.”

Grymbart said,“The trespasses are great. Nevertheless who that is dead must abide dead, and therefore I will forgive it you altogether, with the fear that you shall suffer therefor ere you shall conne excuse you of the death, and hereupon I will assoil you. But the most hinder that you shall have shall be, that you sent Cuwart's head to the Court, and that you blinded the King with sutthe(6) lies. Eme, that was right evil done.”

The Fox said,“What, lief nephew! Who that will go through the world this to hear and that to see and that other to tell, truly it may not clearly be done. How should any man handle honey but if he licked his fingers? I am often rored and pricked in my conscience as to love God above all thing and my even Crysten as myself, as is to God well acceptable and according to his law. But how ween you that reason within forth fights against the outward will, then stand I all still in myself, that me thinks I have lost all my wits, and wote not what me ails, I am then in such a thought I have now all left my sins, and hate all thing that is not good, and climb in high contemplation abone his commandments. But this special grace have I when I am alone; but in a short while after, when the world comes in me, then find I in my way so many stones, and the foot spores(7) that these loose prelates and rich priests go in, that I am anon taken again. Then comes the world and will have this; and the flesh will live pleasantly; which lay before me so many things that I then lose all my good thoughts and purpose. I hear there sing, pipe, laugh, play, and all mirth, and I hear that these prelates and rich curates preach and say all otherwise than they think and do. There learn I to lie, the leasings are most used in the lord's courts; certainly lords, ladies, priests, and clerks, maken most leasings. Men dare not tell to the lords now the truth. There is default. I must flatter and lie also or else I should be shut without the door. I have often heard men say truth and rightfully, and have their reason made with a leasing like to their purpose, who brought it in and went through because their matter should seem the fairer. The leasing often comes unavised, and falls in the matter unwittingly, and so, when she is well clad, it goes forth through with that other.

“Dear Nephew thus must men now lie here and there, say sooth, flatter and menace, pray and curse, and seek every man upon his feeblest and weakest. Who otherwise will now haunt and use the world than devise a leasing in the fairest wise, and that bewimple with kerchiefs about in such wise that men take it for a truth, he is not run away from his master. Can he that subtilty in such wise that he stammer not in his words, and may then be heard, Nephew, this man may do wonder. He may wear scarlet and grise.(8) He wins in the spiritual law and temporal also, and wheresomever he has to do. Now are there many false shrews that have great envy that they have so great fardel,(9) and ween that they can also well lie; and take on them to lie and to tell it forth. He would fain eat of the fat morsels. But he is not believed nor heard. And many are there that be so plump and foolish that when they ween best to pronounce and show their matter and conclude, they fall beside and out thereof, and cannot then help themself, and leave their matter without tail or head; and he is acompted for a fool; and many mock them therewith. But who can give to his leasing a conclusion, and pronounce it without tatelying, like as it were written before him, and that he can so blind the people that his leasing shall better be believed than the truth: that is the man. What cunning is it to say the truth that is good to do? How laugh these false subtle shrews that give counsel, to make these leasings and set them forth, and maken unright go above right, and maken bills and set in things that never were thought nor said, and teach men see through their fingers; and all for to win money and let their tongues to hire for to maintain and strengthen their leasings. Alas, Nephew, this is an evil cunning, of which life-scathe and hurt may come thereof. I say not but that otherwhile men must jape, bourd,(10) and lie in small things; for whoso says alway truth, he may not now go nowhere through the world. There are many that play Placebo. Whoso alway says truth, shall find many lettings in his way. Men may well lie when it is need, and after amend it by counsel. For all trespasses there is mercy. There is no man so wise, but he dooleth(11) other while.”

Grymbart said,“Well, dear Eme, what thing shall you let? You know all thing at the narrowest. You should bring me hastily in doting; your reasons passen my understanding. What need have you to shrive you? You should yourself by right be the priest, and let me and other sheep come to you for to be shriven. You know the state of the world in such wise as no man may halt before you.”

With such manner talking they came walking in to the Court. The Fox sorrowed somewhat in his heart, nevertheless he bare it out and striked forth through all the folk till he came into the place where the King himself was. And Grymbart was alway by the Fox and said,“Eme, be not afraid, and make good cheer! Who that is hardy, the adventure helps him.(12) Often one day is better than sometime a whole year.”

The Fox said,“Nephew, you say truth. God thank you, you comfort me well.”

And forth he went, and looked grimly here and there, as who says,“What will you? here come I.”He saw there many of his kin standing which yonned(13) him but little good, as the Otter, Beaver, and other to the number of ten whom I shall name afterward. And some were there that loved him.

The Fox came in and fell down on his knees before the King, and began his words and said:—

CHAPTER XXVIII


“GOD from whom nothing may be hid, and above all thing is mighty, save my Lord the King and my Lady the Queen and give him grace to know who has right and who has wrong. For there live many in the world that seem otherwise outward than they be within, I would that God showed openly every man's misdeeds, and all their trespasses stooden written in their foreheads, and it cost me more than I now say; and that you, my Lord the King, knew as much as I do how I dispose me both early and late in your service. And therefore am I complained on of the evil shrews, and with leasings am put out of your grace and conceit, and would charge me with great offences, without deserving, against all right. Wherefore I cry out harowe on them that so falsely have belied me, and brought me in such trouble. Howbeit, I hope and know you both my Lord and my Lady for so wise and discreet, that you be not led nor believe such leasings nor false tales out of the right way, for you have not be woned so to do. Therefore, dear Lord, I beseech you to consider by your wisdom all things by right and law. Is it in deed or in speech, do every man right. I desire no better. He that is guilty and found faulty, let him be punished. Men shall well know ere I depart out of this Court who that I am. I cannot flatter, I will always show openly my head.”How the King answered upon Reynart's excuse. All they that were in the palace weren all still and wondered that the Fox spake so stoutly.

The King said,“Ha, Reynart, how well can you your fallacy and salutation doon! But your fair words may not help you. I think well that you shall, this day, for your works be hanged by your neck. I will not much chide with you, but I shall short your pain. That you love us well, that have you well showed on the Cony and on Corbant the Rook. Your falseness and your false inventions shall without long tarrying make you to die. A pot may go so long to water, that at the last it comes tobroken home. I think your pot, that so oft has deceived us, shall now hastily be broken.”

Reynart was in great fear of these words. He would well he had been at Cologne when he came thither. Then thought he I must here through, how that I do.

“My Lord the King,”said he,“it were well reason that you heard my words all out. Though I were dampned to the death, yet ought you to hear my words out. I have yet heretofore time given to you many a good counsel and profitable, and in need alway have biden by you where other beasts have wyked(1) and gone their way. If now the evil beasts with false matters have before you with wrong belied me, and I might not come to my excuse, ought I not then to plain? I have before this seen that I should be heard before another; yet might these things well change and come in their old state. Old good deeds ought to be remembered. I see here many of my lineage and friends standing, that seem they set now little by me, which nevertheless should sore dere(2) in their hearts, that you, my Lord the King, should destroy me wrongfully. If you so did, you should destroy the truest servant that you have in all your lands. What ween you, Sir King, had I known myself guilty in any feat or broke,(3) that I would have come hither to the law among all my enemies? Nay, sire, nay. Not for all the world of red gold. For I was free and at large. What need had I to do that? But, God be thanked, I know myself clear of all misdeeds, that I dare welcome openly in the light and to answer to all the complaints that any man can say on me. But when Grymbart brought me first these tidings, tho was I not well pleased but half from myself, that I leapt here and there as an unwise man, and had I not been in the censures of the Church I had without tarrying have come, but I went dolynge(4) on the heath, and wist not what to do for sorrow. And then it happened that Mertyne, my Eme, the Ape, met with me, which is wiser in clergy than some priest. He has been advocate for the Bishop of Cameryk nine year during. He saw me in this great sorrow and heaviness, and said to me,‘Dear Cousin, me thinks you are not well with yourself, what ails you? Who has displeased you? Thing that touches charge ought to be given in knowledge to friends. A true friend is a great help; he finds oft better counsel than he that the charge rests on, for whosomever is charged with matters is so heavy and acombred with them that oft he can not begin to find the remedy, for such be so woe like as they had lost their inwytte.’(5) I said‘Dear Eme, you say truth, for in likewise is fallen to me. I am brought into a great heaviness, undeserved and not guilty, by one to whom I have alway been an hearty and great friend; that is the Cony which came to me yesterday in the morning whereas I sat before my house and said matins.’

“He told me he would go to the Court, and saluted me friendly, and I him again.

“Tho said he to me,‘Good Reynart, I am an hungred and weary. Have you any meat?’

“I said,‘Yea, ynowh; come near.’

“Tho gave I him a couple of manchets(6) with sweet butter. It was upon a Wednesday, on which day I am not wont to eat any flesh, and also I fasted because of this feast of Whitsuntide which approached. For who that will taste of the overest wisehede, and live ghostly in keeping the commandments of our Lord, he must fast and make him ready against the high feasts. Et vos estote parati. Dear Eme, I gave him fair white bread with sweet butter, wherewith a man might well be eased that were much hungry. And when he had eaten his bellyful, tho came Rossel, my youngest son, and would have taken away that was left. For young children would alway fain eten. And with that he tasted for to have taken somewhat, the Cony smote Rossel before his mouth that his teeth bled, and he fell down half aswoon. When Reynardyn, my eldest son, saw that, he sprang to the Cony and caught him by the head, and should have slain him had I not rescued him. I helped him, that he went from him, and beat my child sore therefor.

“Lapreel the Cony ran to my Lord the King and said I would have murdered him. See, Eme, thus come I in the words and I am laid in the blame. And yet he complaines, and I plain not.

“After this came Corban the Rook fleeing with a sorrowful noise. I asked what him ailed.

“And he said,‘Alas my wife is dead. Yonder lies a dead hare full of moths and worms, and there she ate so much thereof that the worms have bitten atwo her throat.’

“I asked him how comes that by. He would not speak a word more, but flew his way, and let me stand.

“Now says he that I have bitten and slain her. How should I come so nigh her? For she flees and I go afoot. Behold, dear Eme, thus I am born on hand. I may say well that I am unhappy. But peradventure it is for my old sins. It were good for me if I could patiently suffer it.

“The Ape said to me,‘Nephew, you shall go to the Court before the lords, and excuse you.’

“‘Alas, Eme, that may not be, for the Archdeacon has put me in the Pope's curse because I counselled Esegrim the Wolf for to leave his religion at Elmare and forsake his habit. He complained to me that he lived so straitly, as in long fasting, and many things reading and singing, that he could not endure it; if he should long abide there, he should die. I had pity of his complaining, and I holpe him as a true friend, that he came out. Which now me sore repents, for he laboures all that he can against me to the King for to do me be hanged. Thus does he evil for good. See, Eme, thus am I at the end of all my wits and of counsel. For I must go to Rome for an absolution, and then shall my wife and children suffer much harm and blame. For these evil beasts that hate me shall do to them all the hurt they may, and fordrive them where they can. And I would well defend them if I were free of the curse, for then I would go to the Court and excuse me, where now I dare not. I should do great sin if I came among the good people, I am afraid God should plague me.’

“‘Nay, cousin, be not afraid. Ere I should suffer you in this sorrow, I know the way to Rome well. I understand me on this work. I am called there Mertyne the bishop's clerk, and am well beknown there. I shall do cite the Archdeacon and take a plea against him, and shall bring with me for you an absolution against his will, for I know there all that is for to be done or left. There dwells Simon, my Eme, which is great and mighty there. Who that may give aught, he helps him anon. There is Prentout, Wayte, Scathe, and other of my friends and allies. Also I shall take some money with me if I need any. The prayer is with gifts hardy;(7) with money alway the right goes forth. A true friend shall for his friend adventure both life and good, and so shall I for you in your right. Cousin, make good cheer! I shall not rest after to-morrow till I come to Rome, and I shall solicit your matters. And go you to the Court as soon as you may. All your misdeeds and the sins that have brought you in the great sentence and curse, I make you quit of them and take them in myself. When you come to the Court you shall find there Rukenawe my wife, her two sisters, and my three children, and many more of our lineage. Dear cousin, speak to them hardily. My wife is sondrely(8) wise, and will gladly do somewhat for her friends. Who that has need of help shall find in her great friendship. One shall alway seek on his friends, though he has angered them, for blood must creep where it cannot go. And if so be that you be so overcharged that you may have no right, then send to me by night and day to the Court of Rome, and let me have knowledge thereof, and all tho that are in the land, is it King or Queen, wife or man, I shall bring them all in the Pope's Curse and send there an interdict that no man shall read nor singen nor christen children, nor bury the dead, nor receive sacrament, till that you shall have good right. Cousin, this shall I well get, for the Pope is so sore old that he is but little set by, and the cardinal of Pure Gold has all the might of the Court. He is young and great of friends, he has a concubine whom he much loves, and what she desires that gets she anon. See, Cousin, she is my niece, and I am great and may do much with her, in such wise what I desire I fail not of it but am alway furthered therein. Wherefore, Cousin, bid my Lord the King that he do you right I wote well he will not warn(9) you, for the right is heavy enough to every man.’

“My Lord the King, when I heard this I laughed, and with great gladness came hither, and have told you all truth. If there be any in this Court that can lay on me any other matter with good witness, and prove it, as ought to be to a noble man, let me then make amends according to the law; and if you will not leave off hereby, then set me day and field, and I shall make good on him all so ferre as he be of as good birth as I am and to me like, and who that can with fighting get the worship of the field, let him have it. This right has standen yet hitherto, and I will not it should be broken by me. The law and right does no man wrong.”

All the beasts both poor and rich were all still when the Fox spake so stoutly. The Cony Lapreel and the Rook were so sore afraid that they durst not speak, but piked and striked them out of the Court both two, and when they were a room far in the plain they said,“God grant that this fell murderer may fare evil. He can bewrap and cover his falsehood, that his words seem as true as the gospel. Hereof knows no man than we: how should we bring witness. It is better that we wyke(10) and depart, than we should hold a field and fight with him; he is so shrewd, yea though there of us were five we could not defend us, but that he should slay us all.”

Esegrim the Wolf and Bruin the Bear were woe in themself when they saw these two room the court.

The King said,“If any man will complain, let him come forth, and we shall hear him: yesterday camen here so many, where are they now Reynart is here?”

The Fox said,“My Lord, there are many that complain that and if they saw their adversary they would be still and make no plaint; witness now of Lapreel the Cony and Corbant the Rook, which have complained on me to you in my absence, but now that I am come in your presence they flee away, and dare not abide by their words. If men should believe false shrews it should do much harm and hurt to the good men, as for me it skills not. Nevertheless, my lord, if they had by your commandment asked of me forgiveness, how be it they have greatly trespassed, yet I had for your sake pardoned and forgive them; for I will not be out of charity, nor hate nor complain on my enemies. But I set all thing in God's hand, he shall work and avenge it as it pleases him.”

The King said,“Reynart, me thinks you be grieved as you say. Are you withinforth as you seem outward? Nay, it is not so clear nor so open, nowhere nigh, as you here have showed. I must say what my grief is, which touches your worship and life, that is to wit that you have done a foul and shameful trespass when I had pardoned you all your offences and trespasses, and you promised to go over the sea on pilgrimage, and gave to you male and staff. And after this you sent me by Bellyn the Ram the male again and therein Cuwart's Head. How might you do a more reprovable trespass? How were you so hardy to dare to me do such a shame? Is it not evil done to send to a lord his servant's head? You cannot say nay hereagainst, for Bellyn the Ram, which was our chaplain, told us all the matter how it happed? Such reward as he had when he brought us the message, the same shall you have, or right shall fail.”

Tho was Reynart so sore afraid that he wist not what to say. He was at his wit's end, and looked about him piteously, and saw many of his kin and allies that heard all this, but nought they said. He was all pale in his visage, but no man proffered him hand nor foot to help him.

The King said,“Thou subtle fellow and false shrew, why speakest thou not? Now dumb?”

The Fox stood in great dread, and sighed sore that all heard him. But the Wolf and the Bear were glad thereof.

CHAPTER XXIX


DAME Rukenawe the She Ape, Reynart's Aunt, was not well pleased. She was great with the Queen and well beloved. It happened well for the Fox that she was there, for she understood all wisdom, and she durst well speak, where as it to do was. Wherever she came everich was glad of her.

She said,“My Lord the King, you ought not to be angry when you sit in judgment, for that becomes not your nobleness. A man that sits in judgment ought to put from him all wrath and anger. A lord ought to have discretion that should sit in justice. I know better the points of the law than some that wear furred gowns, for I have learned many of them and was made cunning in the law. I had in the Pope's palace of Woerden a good bed of hay, where other beasts lay on the hard ground, and also when I had there to do I was suffered to speak, and was heard before another because I knew so well the law. Seneca writes that a lord shall overall do right and law, he shall charge none to whom he has given his safeguard to above the right and law; the law ought not to halt for no man. And every man that stands here would well bethink him what he has done and bedriven(1) in his days, he should the better have patience and pity on Reynart. Let every man know him self, that is my counsel. There is none that stands so surely but otherwhile he falls or slides. Who that never misdid nor sinned is holy and good, and has no need to amend him. When a man does amiss and then by counsel amendeth it, that is humanly and so ought he to do; but alway to misdo and trespass and not to amend him, that is evil and a devily life. Mark then what is written in the gospel, Estote misericordes, be you merciful; yet stands there more, Nolite judicare et non judicabimini, deem you no man and you shall not be deemed. There stands also how the pharisees brought a woman taken in adultery and would have stoned her to death. They asked Our Lord what he said thereto; he said,‘Who of you all is without sin let him cast the first stone.’Tho abode no man but left her there standing. Me thinks it is so here. There be many that see a straw in another's eyou that can not see a balke in his own. There be many that deem other, and himself is worst of all. Though one fall oft, and at last arises up and comes to mercy, he is not thereof damned. God receives all them that desire his mercy. Let no man condemn another though they wist that he had done amiss; yet let them see their own defaults, and then may they themself correct first, and then Reynart my Cousin should not fare the worse. For his father and his grandfather have alway been in more love and reputation in this Court than Esegrim the Wolf or Bruin the Bear with all their friends and lineage. It has been heretofore an unlike comparison, the wisdom of Reynart my Cousin, and the honour and worship of him, that he has done, and the counsel of them; for they know not how the world goes. Me thinks this Court is all turned upside down. These false shrews, flatterers, and deceivers, arise and wax great by the lordes, and are enhanced up; and the good, true, and wise are put down, for they have been wont to counsel truly and for the honour of the King. I can not see how this may stand long.”

Then said the King,“Dame, if he had done to you such trespass as he has done to other it should repent you. Is it wonder that I hate him? He breaks away my safeguard. Have you not heard the complaints that here have been showed of him, of murder, of theft, and of treason? Have you such trust in him? Think you that he is thus good and clear? then set him up on the altar, and worship and pray to him as to a saint. But there is none in all the world that can say any good of him; you may say much for him, but in the end you shall find him all nought. He has neither kin nor one friend that will enterprise to help him. He has so deserved. I have great marvel of you. I heard never of none that has fellowshipped with him that ever thanked him or said any good of him, save you now, but alway he has striked them with his tail.”

Then the She Ape answered and said,“My lord, I love him and have him in great charity. And also I know a good deed that he once in your presence did, whereof you could him great thank. Though now it be thus turned, yet shall the heaviest weigh most. A man shall love his friend by measure, and not his enemy hate overmuch. Steadfastness and constancy is fitting and behoves to the lords, how soever the world turns. Me ought not to praise too much the day, till even be come. Good counsel is good for him that will do thereafter.”

CHAPTER XXX


“NOW two year past came a Man and a Serpent here into this Court for to have judgment, which was to you and yours right doubtful. The Serpent stood in an hedge whereas he supposed to have gone through, but he was caught in a snare by the neck that he might not escape without help, but should have lost his life there. The Man came forth by, and the Serpent called to him and cried, and prayed the Man that he would help him out of the snare, or else he must there die. The Man had pity of him, and said,‘If thou promise to me that thou wilt not envenom me, nor do me none harm nor hurt, I shall help thee out of this peril.’The Serpent was ready, and swore a great oath that he now nor never should do him harm nor hurt. Then he unloosed him and delivered him out of the snare. And they went forth together a good while that the Serpent had great hunger, for he had not eaten a great while before, and sterte to the Man and would have slain him. The Man sterte away and was afraid, and said,‘Wilt thou now slay me? hast thou forgotten the oath that thou madest to me that thou shouldest not misdo nor hurt me?’The Serpent answered,‘I may do it good before all the world that I do. The need of hunger may cause a man to break his oath.’The Man said,‘If it may be not better, give me so long respite till we meet and find that may judge the matter by right.’The Serpent granted thereto. Thus they went together so long that they found Tyseln the Raven and Slyndpere his son; there rehearsed they their reasons. Tyseln the Raven judged anon that he should eat the Man. He would fain have eaten his part, and his son also. The Serpent said to the Man,‘How is it now? What think you? Have I not won?’The Man said,‘How should a robber judge this? He should have avail thereby. And also he is alone: there must be two or three at least together, and that they understand the right and law, and that done let the sentence gon; I am nevertheless ill on enough.’They agreed and went forth both together so long that they found the Bear and the Wolf, to whom they told their matter. And they anon judged that the Serpent should slay the Man. For the need of hunger breaks oath alway. The Man then was in great doubt and fear, and the Serpent came and cast his venom at him; but the Man leapt away from him with great pain, and said,‘You do great wrong that you thus lie in await to slay me. You have no right thereto.’The Serpent said,‘Is it not enough yet? It has been twice judged.’‘Yea,’said the Man,‘that is of them that are wont to murder and rob. All that ever they swear and promise they hold not. But I appeal this matter into the Court before our Lord the King, and that thou mayst not forsake.(1) And what judgment that shall be given there, shall I obey and suffer, and never do the contrary.’The Bear and the Wolf said that it should be so, and that the Serpent desired no better. They supposed if it should come before you it should go there as they would. I think you be well remembered hereof. Tho came they all to the Court before you; and the Wolf's two children came with their father, which were called Empty Belly and Never Full, because they would eat of the Man; for they howled for great hunger. Wherefore you commanded them to avoid your Court. The Man stood in great dread, and called upon your good grace, and told how the Serpent would have taken his life from him, to whom he had saved his life, and that, above his oath and promise, he would have devoured him. The Serpent answered,‘I have not trespassed, and that I report me wholly unto the King. For I did it to save my life, for need of life one may break his oath and promise.’My Lord that time were you and all your Council herewith accombred. For your noble grace saw the great sorrow of the Man, and you would not that a man should for his gentleness and kindness be judged to death. And on that other, since hunger, and need to save the life, seeks narrowly to be holpen, here was none in all the Court that could nor knew the right hereof. There were some that would fain the Man had be holpen. I see them here standing. I wot well they said that they could not end this matter. Then commanded you that Reynart, my nephew, should come and say his advice in this matter. That time was he above all other believed and heard in this Court, and you bade him give sentence according to the best right and we all shall follow him, for he knew the ground of the law. Reynart said,‘My Lord, it is not possible to give a true sentence after their words, for in hearsaying are oft leasings. But and if I might see the Serpent in the same peril and need that he was in when the Man loosed him and unbound, then wist I well what I should say. And who that would do otherwise he should misdo against right.’Then said, you, my Lord,‘Reynart, that is well said. We all accord hereto; for no man can say better.’Then went the Man and the Serpent into the place whereas he found the Serpent. Reynart bade that the Serpent should be set in the snare in likewise as he was. And it was done. Then said you, my Lord,‘Reynart, how thinks you now? What judgment shall we give?’Then said Reynart the Fox,‘My Lord, now are they both like as they were before. They have neither won nor lost. See, my Lord, how I judge for a right, also ferre as it shall please your noble grace. If the Man will now loose and unbind the Serpent, upon the promise and oath that he before made to him, he may well do it. But if he think that he for anything should be encumbered or hindered by the Serpent, or for need of hunger would break his oath and promise, then judge I that the Man may go freely where he will, and let the Serpent abide still bounden, like as he might have done at the beginning: for he would have broken his oath and promise, whereas he holp him out of such fearful peril. Thus thinks me a rightful judgment that the Man shall have his free choice like as he before had.’Lo my Lord this judgment thought you good, and all your council which at that time were by you; and followed the same, and praised Reynart's wisdom, that he had made the Man quit and free. Thus the Fox wisely kept your noble honour and worship, as a true servant is bound to do to his Lord. Where has the Bear or the Wolf done ever to you so much worship? They conne well huylen and blasen, steal and rob, and eat fat morsels and fill their bellies, and then judge they for right and law that small thieves that steal hens and chickens should be hanged, but they themself that steal kine, oxen, and horses, they shall go quit and be lords. And same as though they were wiser than Solomon, Avicene, or Aristoteles; and each will be holden high proud, and praised of great deeds and hardy; but and they come where as it is to do, they are the first that flee. Then must the simple go forth before, and they keep the reward behind. Och, my Lord, these and other like to them be not wise, but they destroy town, castle, land, and people. They reck not whose house burns, so that they may warm them by the coals. They seek all their own avail and singular profit. But Reynart the Fox and all his friends and lineage sorowen(2) and think to prefer the honour, worship, fordeel,(3) and profit of their lord, and for wise counsel which oft more profits here than pride and boast. This does Reynart, though he have no thank. At long it shall be well known who is best and does most profit. My Lord, you say that his kin and lineage draw all afterward from him, and stand not by him for his falsehood and deceivable and subtle touches. I would another had said that; there should then such wrake be taken thereof that him might growl that ever he saw him. But, my Lord, we will forbear you; you may save your pleasure; and also I say it not by you. Were there any that would bedrive anything against you, with words or with werkes, him that would we so do to, that men should say we had been there. There as fighting is, we are not wont to be afraid. My Lord, by your leave, I may well give you knowledge of Reynart's friends and kin. There are many of them that for his sake and love will adventure life and good. I know myself for one. I am a wife. I should, if he had need, set my life and good for him. Also I have three full waxen children which are hardy and strong, whom I would all together adventure for his love, rather than I should see him destroyed; yet had I liever die than I saw them miscarry before my eyes, so well love I them.”

CHAPTER XXXI


DAME Rukenawe called them forth and said,“Welcome, my dear children: to me forth, and stand by Reynart, your dear nephew.”Then said she,“Come forth all you that be of my kin and Reynart's, and let us pray the King that he will do to Reynart right of the land.”

Tho came forth many a beast anon, as the Squirrel, the Muskrat, the Fitchews, the Marten, the Beaver with his wife Ordegale, the Genete,(1) the Otter, the Boussyng, and the Ferret, these two eat as fain polaylle as does Reynart. The Otter and Pantecroet his wife, whom I had almost forgotten, yet were they before, with the Beaver, enemies to the Fox, but they durst not gainsay Dame Rukenawe, for they were afraid of her. She was also the wisest of all his kin of counsel and was most doubted.(2) There came also more than twenty other, because of her, for to stand by Reynart. There came also Dame Atrote with her two sisters, Weasel and Hermelin, the Ass, the Badger, the Water-rat, and many more to the number of forty, which all camen and stoden by Reynart the Fox.

“My Lord the King,”said Rukenawe,“come and see here if Reynart have any friends. Here may you see we are your true subjects, which for you would adventure both life and good if you had need. Though you be hardy, mighty, and strong, our well-willed friendship cannot hurt you. Let Reynart the Fox well bethink him upon these matters that you have laid against him, and if he cannot excuse them, then do him right. We desire no better. And this by right ought to no man be warned.”(3)

The Queen then spake,“This said I to him yesterday. But he was so fierce and angry that he would not hear it.”

The Leopard said also,“Sire, you may judge no further than your men give their verdict; for if you would go forth by will and might, that were not worshipful for your estate. Hear always both parties, and then by the best and wisest counsel give judgment discreetly according to the best right.”

The King said,“This is all true, but I was so sore moved when I was informed of Cuwart's death and saw his head, that I was hot and hasty. I shall hear the Fox Can he answer and excuse him of that is laid against him, I shall gladly let him go quit; and also at request of his good friends and kin.”

Reynart was glad of these words, and thought, God thank my Aunt, she has the rys do blosme again.(4) She has well holpen me forth now. I have now a good foot to dance on. I shall now look out of my eyes, and, bring forth the fairest leasing that ever man heard, and bring myself out of this danger.

CHAPTER XXXII


THEN spake Reynart the Fox and said,“Alas, what say you! is Cuwart dead? And where is Bellyn the Ram? What brought he to you when he came again? For I delivered to him three jewels; I would fain know where they are become. That one of them should he have given to you, my Lord the King, and the other-two to my Lady the Queen.”

The King said,“Bellyn brought us nought else but Cuwart's head, like as I said you before; whereof I took on him wrake. I made him to lose his life, for the foul caitiff said to me that he himself was of the counsel of the letters making that were in the male.”

“Alas, my lord, is this very truth? Woe to me caitiff that ever I was born! Since that these good jewels be thus lost, my heart will break for sorrow. I am sorry that I now live! What shall my wife say when she hears hereof? She shall go out of her wit for sorrow. I shall never, all so long as I live, have her friendship. She shall make much sorrow when she hears thereof.”

The She Ape said,“Reynart, dear Nephew, what profits that you make all this sorrow? Let it pass, and tell us what these jewels were. Peradventure we shall find counsel to have them again. If they be above earth Master Akeryn shall labour for them in his books, and also we shall curse for them in all the churches, unto the time that we have knowledge where they been. They may not be lost.”

“Nay, Aunt, think not that, for they that have them will not lightly depart from them. There was never King that ever gave so rich jewels as these be. Nevertheless you have somewhat with your words eased my heart and made it lighter than it was. Alas, lo, here you may see how he or they to whom a man trusts most is often by him or them deceived. Though I should go all the world through, and my life in adventure set therefor, I shall wit where these jewels are become.”With a dismalled and sorrowful speech, said the Fox:“Hearken you all my kin and friends, I shall name to you these jewels what they were, and then may you say that I have a great loss. That one of them was a ring of fine gold, and within the ring next the finger were written letters enamelled with sable and azure, and there were three Hebrew names therein. I could not myself read nor spell them, for I understand not that language; but Master Abrion of Trier he is a wise man, he understands well all manner of languages and the virtue of all manner herbs, and there is no beast so fierce nor strong but he can dompte him, for if he see him once he shall do as he will, and yet he believes not on God. He is a Jew, the wisest in conning, and specially he knows the virtue of stones. I showed him once this ring. He said that they were tho three names that Seth brought out of Paradise when he brought to his father Adam the Oyle of Mercy, and whosomever bears on him these three names he shall never be hurt by thunder nor lightning, nor no witchcraft shall have power over him, nor be tempted to do sin. And also he shall never take harm by cold though he lay three winters long nights in the field, though it snowed, stormed, or frore, never so sore, so great might have these words, witness of Master Abrion. Without forth on the ring stood a stone of three manner colours; the one part was like red crystal, and shone like as fire had been therein, in such wise that if one would go by night him behoved none other light, for the shining of the stone made and gave as great a light as it had been midday; that other part of the stone was white and clear as it had been burnished, who so had in his eyes any smart or soreness, or in his body any swelling, or headache, or any sickness, withoutforth if he striked this stone on the place where the grief is he shall anon be whole; or if any man be sick in his body of venom, or ill meat in his stomach, of colic, strangulation, stone, fistel, or cancer, or any other sickness, save only the very death, let him lay this stone in a little water and let him drink it, and he shall forthwith be whole and all quit of his sickness. Alas,”said the Fox,“we have good cause to be sorry to lose such a jewel! Furthermore the third colour was green like glass, but there were some sprinkles therein like purple; the master told for truth, that who that bare this stone upon him should never be hurt of his enemy, and was no man, were he never so strong and hardy, that might misdo him; and wherever that he fought he should have victory, were it by night or by day, also ferre as he beheld it fasting; and also thereto, wheresomever he went and in what fellowship, he should be beloved, though he had hated him before, if he had the ring upon him they should forget their anger as soon as they saw him. Also though he were all naked in a field again an hundred armed men, he should be well hearted and escape from them with worship; but he must be a noble gentleman and have no churl's conditions, for then the stone had no might. And because this stone was so precious and good, I thought in myself that I was not able nor worthy to bear it, and therefore I sent it to my dear Lord the King, for I know him for the most noble that now lives, and also all our welfare and worship lies on him, and for he should be kept from all dread, need, and ungheluck.(1)

“I found this ring in my father's treasure, and in the same place I took a glass or a mirror and a comb which my wife would algates have. A man might wonder that saw these jewels. I sent these to my Lady the Queen, for I have founden her good and gracious to me. This Comb might not be too much praised. It was made of the bone of a clean noble beast named Panthera, which feeds him between the great Inde and Earthly Paradise. He is so lusty fair and of colour, that there is no colour under the heaven but some likeness is in him; thereto he smells so sweet, that the savour of him boteth(2) all sickness; and for his beauty and sweet smelling all other beasts follow him, for by his sweet savour they are healed of all sickness. This Panthera has a fair bone, broad and thin; when so is that this beast is slain all the sweet odour rested in the bone, which cannot be broken, nor shall never rot, nor be destroyed by fire, by water, nor by smiting, it is so hardy, tight and fast, and yet it is light of weight. The sweet odour of it has great might; that who that smells it sette nought by none other lust in the world, and is eased and quit of all manner diseases and infirmities, and also he is jocund and glad in his heart. This Comb is polished as it were fine silver, and the teeth of it be small and strait, and between the greater teeth and the smaller is a large field and space where is carven many an image subtilly made and enamelled about with fine gold; the field is checked with sable and silver, enamelled with cybore(3) and azure, and therein is the history how Venus, Juno, and Pallas strove for the apple of gold which each of them would have had, which controversy was set upon Paris that he should give it to the fairest of them three. Paris was that time an herdman, and kept his father's beasts and sheep without Troy. When he had received the apple, Juno promised to him if he would judge that she might have the apple, he should have the most riches of the world. Pallas said if she might have the apple she would give him wisdom and strength, and make him so great a lord that he should overcome all his enemies and whom he would. Venus said,‘What needest thou riches or strength, art not thou Priamus' son, and Hector is thy brother, which have all Asia under their power? Art not thou one of the possessors of great Troy? If thou wilt give to me the apple, I shall give thee the richest treasure of the world, and that shall be the fairest woman that ever had life on earth, nor never shall none be born fairer than she. Then shalt thou be richer than rich, and shalt climb above all other, for that is the treasure that no man can prize enough; for honest fair and good women can put away many a sorrow from the heart, they be shamefast and wise, and bring a man in very joy and bliss.’Paris heard this Venus, which presented him this great joy and fair lady, and prayed her to name this fair lady that was so fair, and where she was. Venus said,‘It is Helen, King Menelaus' wife of Greece, there lives not a nobler, richer, gentler, nor wiser wife in all the world.’Then Paris gave to her the apple, and said that she was fairest. How that he got afterward Helen by the help of Venus, and how he brought her in to Troy and wedded her, the great love and jolly life that they had together, was all carven in the field, everything by himself, and the story written.

“Now you shall hear of the Mirror. The glass that stood thereon was of such virtue that men might see therein all that was done within a mile, of men of beasts and of all thing that me would(4) desire to wit and know. And what man looked in the glass, had he only disease of pricking or motes, smart, or pearls in his eyes, he should be anon healed of it, such great virtue had the glass. Is it then wonder if I be moved and angry for to lose such manner jewels? The tree in which this glass stood was light and fast and was named Cetyne.(5) It should endure ever ere it would rot, or worms should hurt it, and therefore King Solomon ceiled his temple with the same wood withinforth. Men praised it dearer than fine gold; it is like to tree of hebenus, of which wood King Crompart made his horse of tree for love of King Morcadigas' daughter that was so fair, whom he had weened for to have won. That horse was so made within, that whosoever rode on it, if he would, he should be within less than one hour an hundred miles thence; and that was well proved, for Cleomedes the king's son would not believe that that horse of tree had such might and virtue. He was young, lusty, and hardy, and desired to do great deeds of praise for to be renowned in this world, and leapt on this horse of tree. Crompart turned a pin that stood on his breast, and anon the horse lift him up and went out of the hall by the window, and ere one might say his pater noster he was gone more than ten mile away. Cleomedes was sore afraid, and supposed never to have turned again, as the history(6) thereof tells more plainly. But how great dread he had, and how far that he rode upon that horse made of the tree of hebenus ere he could know the art and craft how he should turn him; and how joyful he was when he knew it; and how men sorrowed for him; and how he knew all this, and the joy thereof when he came again, all this I pass over for losing of time; but the most part of all came to by the virtue of the wood, of which wood the tree that the glass stood in was made. And that was, without forth of the glass, half a foot broad, wherein stood some strange histories, which were of gold, of sable, of silver, of yellow, azure, and cynope, these six colours were therein wrought in such wise as it behoved; and under every history the words were graven and enamelled, that every man might understand what each history was. After my judgment there was never mirror so costly, so lustly, nor so pleasant. In the beginning stood there an Horse, made fat, strong, and sore envious upon an Hart which ran in the field so far and swiftly that the Horse was angry that he ran so far before him and could not overtake him. He thought he should catch him and subdue him, though he should suffer much pain therefor. The Horse spake tho to a Herdman in this wise,‘If thou couldst taken an Hart that I well can show thee, thou shouldst have great profit thereof; thou shouldst sell dear his horns, his skin, and his flesh.’The Herdman said,‘How may I come by him?’The Horse said,‘Sit upon me, and I shall bear thee, and we shall hunt him till he be take.’The Herdman sprang and sat upon the Horse, and saw the Hart; and he rode after; but the Hart was light of foot and swift, and outran the Horse far. They hunted so far after him that the Horse was weary, and said to the Herdman that sat on him,‘Now sit off, I will rest me, I am all weary, and give me leave to go from thee.’The Herdman said,‘I have arrested thee; thou mayst not escape from me; I have a bridle on thy head and spurs on my heels; thou shalt never have thank hereof; I shall bedwynge and subdue thee, hadst thou sworn the contrary.’See how the Horse brought himself in thraldom and was taken in his own net. How may one better be taken than by his own proper envy suffer himself to be taken and ridden. There are many that labour to hurt other, and they themselven are hurt and rewarded with the same. There was also made an Ass and an Hound which dwelled both with a rich man. The man loved his Hound well, for he played oft with him as folk do with Hounds. The Hound leapt up and played with his tail, and licked his master about the mouth. This saw Howdwin the Ass, and had great spite thereof in his heart, and said to himself,‘How may this be? and what may my lord see on his foul Hound, whom I never see does good nor profit save springs on him and kisses him? But me, whom men putten to labour, to bear and draw and do more in a week than he with his fifteen should do in a whole year, —and yet sits he nevertheless by him at the table and there eats bones, flesh, and fat trenchours, —and I have nothing but thistles and nettles, and lie on nights on the hard earth, and suffer many a scorn. I will no longer suffer this. I will think how I may get my lord's love and friendship, like as the Hound does.’Therewith came the lord, and the Ass lift up his tail and sprang with his fore feet on the lord's shoulders and blared, grinned, and sang, and with his feet made two great boles about his ears, and put forth his mouth and would have kissed the lord's mouth as he had seen the Hound done. Tho cried the lord, sore afraid,‘Help! help! this Ass will slay me!’Then came his servants with staves and smiten and beat the Ass so sore that he had weened he should have lost his life. Tho returned he to his stable and ate thistle and nettles and was an Ass as he before was. In likewise whoso have enough and spite of another's welfare, and were served in likewise, it should be well behoveful. Therefore it is concluded that the Ass shall eat thistles and nettles and bear the sack. Though men would do him worship he cannot understand it, but must use old lewd manners. Whereas asses getten lordships, there men see seldom good rule. For they take heed of nothing but on their singular profit; yet are they take up and risen great, the more pity is. Hearken further how my father and Tybert the Cat went together, and had sworn by their truth that for love nor hate they should not depart. And what they got they should depart to each the half. Then on a time they saw hunters coming over the field with many hounds. They leapt and ran fast from themward all that they might, as they that were afraid of their life.‘Tybert,’said the Fox,‘Whither shall we now best flee? the hunters have espied us. Know you any help?’My father trusted on the promise that each made to other, and that he would for no need depart from him.‘Tybert,’said he,‘I have a sackful of wiles if we have need; as far as we abide together we need not to doubt hunters nor hounds.’Tybert began to sigh and was sore afraid, and said,‘Reynart, what availlen many words? I know but one wile, and thither must I too.’And tho clamb he up on a high tree into the top under the leaves, whereas hunter nor hound might do him none harm, and left my father alone in jeopardy of his life, for the hunters set on him the hounds all that they could. Men blew the horns, and cried, and hallooed,‘The Fox! Slee and take!’When Tybert the Cat saw that, he mocked and scorned my father and said,‘What, Reynart, cousin, unbind now your sack where all the wiles are in! It is now time. You be so wise called; help yourself, for you have need.’This much must my father hear of him to whom he had most his trust on, and was almost taken, and nigh his death. And he ran and fled with great fear of his life, and let his male slide off because he would be the lighter. Yet all that could not help him, for the hounds were too swift and should have bitten him; but he had one adventure that thereby he found an old hole, wherein he crept, and escaped thus the hunters and hounds. Thus held this false deceiver Tybert his sykernes that he had promised. Alas, how many are there now a days that keep not their promise, and set not thereby though they break it! And though I hate Tybert herefor, is it wonder? But I do not. Sikerly, I love my soul too well thereto. Nevertheless, if I saw him in adventure and misfall in his body or in his goods, I think it should not much go to my heart, so that another did it. Nevertheless, I shall neither hate him nor have envy at him. I shall, for God's love, forgive him. Yet is it not so clear out of my heart but a little ill-will to himward abides therein as this comes to my remembrance; and the cause is that the sensuality of my flesh fights against reason. Ther stood also in that Mirror, of the Wolf, how he found once upon a heath a dead horse flayen, but all the flesh was eaten. Then went he and bote great morsels of the bones, that for hunger he took three or four at once and swallowed them in, for he was so greedy that one of the bones stack thwart in his mouth. Whereof he had great pain, and was of great fear of his life. He sought all about for wise masters and surgeons, and promised great gifts for to be healed of his disease. At last, when he could nowhere find remedy, he came to the Crane with his long neck and bill, and prayed him to help him, and he would love and reward him so well that he should ever be the better. The Crane hearked after this great reward, and put his head into his throat, and brought out the bone with his bill. The Wolf start aside with the plucking, and cried out,‘Alas, thou doest me harm! but I forgive it thee. Do no more so, I would not suffer it of another.’The Crane said,‘Sir Esegrim, go and be merry, for you be all whole. Now give to me that you promised.’The Wolf said,‘Will you hear what he says? I am he that has suffered and have cause to plain, and he will have good of me! He thanketh not me of the kindness that I did to him. He put his head in my mouth, and I suffered him to draw it out whole without hurting; and he did to me also harm. And if any here should have a reward, it should be I, by right.’

“Thus the unkind men nowadays reward them that do them good. When the false and subtle arise and become great, then goes worship and profit all to nought. There are many, of right that ought reward and do good to such as have helpen them in their need, that now find causes and say they be hurt, and would have amends where they ought to reward and make amends themself. Therefore it is said, and truth it is, who that will chide or chastise see that he be clear himself. All this and much more than I now can well remember was made and wrought in this glass. The master that ordained it was a cunning man and a profound clerk in many sciences. And because these jewels were over good and precious for me to keep and have, therefore I sent them to my dear Lord the King and to the Queen in present. Where are they now that give to their lords such presents. The sorrow that my two children made when I sent away the glass was great; for they were wont to look therein and see themself how their clothing and array became them on their bodies. Oh, alas! I knew not that Cuwart the Hare was so nigh his death when I delivered him the male with these jewels. I wist not to whom I might better have taken them, though it should have cost me my life, than him and Bellyn the Ram. They were two of my best friends. Out, alas! I cry upon the murderer. I shall know who it was, though I should run through all the world to seek him, for murder abides not hid, it shall come out. Peradventure he is in this company that knows where Cuwart is become, though he tells it not; for many false shrews walk with good men, from whom no man can keep him, they known their craft so well and can well cover their falseness. But the most wonder that I have is that my Lord the King here sayeth so felly, that my father nor I did him never good. That thinks me marvel, of a king. But there come so many things before him that he forgets that one with that other, and so fares by me. Dear Lord, remember not you when my Lord your father lived, and you an youngling of two year were, that my father came from school from Monpellier whereas he had five year studied in recipes of medicines. He knew all the tokens of the urine as well as his hand, and also all the herbs, and nature of them which were viscous or laxative. He was a singular master in that science. He might well wear cloth of silk and a gilt girdle. When he came to Court he found the King in a great sickness, whereof he was sorry in his heart, for he loved him above all other lords. The King would not forego him, for when he came all other had leave to walk where they would; he trusted none so much as him. He said,‘Reynart, I am sick, and feel me the longer the worse.’My father said,‘My dear Lord, here is an urinal: make your water therein, and as soon as I may see it I shall tell what sickness it is and also how you shall be holpen.’The King did as he counselled him, for he trusted no man better that lived. Though so were that my father did not as he should have done to you, but that was by counsel of evil and foul beasts —I had wonder thereof—but it was a raising against his death. He said,‘My Lord, if you will be whole you must eat the liver of a wolf of seven year old, that may you not leave or else you shall die; for your urine shows it plainly.’

“The Wolf stood thereby and said nought.

“But the King said to him,‘Sir Esegrim, now, you hear well that I must have your liver if I will be whole.’

“Tho answered the Wolf and said,‘Nay my lord not so, I wot well I am not yet five year old. I have heard my mother say so.’

“My father said,‘What skills these words? Let him be opened, and I shall know by the liver if it be good for you or not.’

“And therewith the Wolf was taken to kitchen, and his liver taken out, which the King ate and was anon all whole of all his sickness. Then thanketh he my father much, and commanded all his household upon their lives that after that time they should call him Master Reynart.

“He abode still by the King, and was believed of all things, and must always go by his side; and the King gave to him a garland of roses which he must always wear on his head. But now this is all turned. All the old good things that he did be forgotten, and these covetous and ravenous shrews are taken up and set on the high bench, and are heard and made great, and the wise folk are put aback, by which these lords oft lack, and cause them to be in much trouble and sorrow. For when a covetous man of low birth is made a lord, and is much great, and above his neighbours has power and might, then he knows not himself, nor whence he is come, and has no pity on no man's hurt, nor hears no man's request, but if he may have great gifts. All his intent and desire is to gather good, and to be greater. Oh, how many covetous men are now in lords' courts! They flatter and smeke,(7) and please the prince, for their singular avail, but and the prince had need of them or their good, they should rather suffer him to die, or fare right hard, ere they would give or lend him. They be like the Wolf that had liefer the King had died than he would give him his liver. Yet had I liefer ere that the King or the Queen should fare amiss, that twenty such wolves should lose their lives; it were also the least loss. My lord, all this befell in your youth, that my father did thus. I think you have forgotten it.

“And also I have my self done you reverence, worship, and courtesy. Unroused be it, though you now thank me but little, but peradventure you remembered not that I shall now say, —not to any forwitting of you, for you be worthy all worship and reverence that any man can do; that have you of Almighty God by inheritance of your noble progenitors, wherefore I your humble subject and servant am bounden to do to you all the service that I can or may. I came on a time walking with the Wolf Esegrim, and we had gotten under us both a Swine. And for his loud crying we bit him to death; and, sire, you came from far out of a grove against us. You saluted us friendly, and said we were welcome, and that you and my Lady the Queen, which came after you, had great hunger and had nothing for to eat, and prayed us for to give you part of our winning. Esegrim spake so soft that a man uneasily might hear him, but I spake out and said,‘yea, my lord, with a good will. Though it were more, we will well that you have part.’And then the Wolf departed as he was wont to do; departed, and took that one half for himself, and he gave you a quarter for you and for the Queen. That other quarter he ate and bit as hastily as he might, because he would eat it alone. And he gave to me but half the lungs, that I pray God that evil might he fare.

“Thus showed he his conditions and nature. Ere men should have sungen a Credo, you, my lord, had eaten your part, and yet would you fain have had more, for you were not full. And because he gave you no more, nor proffered you, you lift up your right foot and smote him between the ears that you tore his skin over his eyes, and tho he might no longer abide, but he bled, howled, and ran away, and left his part there lying. Tho said you to him,‘Haste you again hither, and bring to us more. And here after see better to how you deal and part.’Then said I,‘My lord, if it please you I will go with him, I wot well what you said.’I went with him. He bled and groaned, as sore as he was, all softly; he durst not cry loud. We went so far that we brought a calf. And when you saw us come therewith you laughed, for you were well pleased, you said to me that I was swift in hunting:‘I see well that you can find well when you take it upon you. You be good to send forth in a need. The calf is good and fat, hereof shall you be the dealer.’I said,‘My lord, with a good will. The one half, my lord, shall be for you. And that other half for my lady the Queen. The moghettis, liver, lungs, and the inward, shall be for your children. The head shall Esegrim the Wolf have, and I will have the feet.’Tho said you,‘Reynart, who has taught you to depart so courteously?’‘My lord,’said I,‘that has done this priest that sits here with the bloody crown. He lost his skin with the uncourteous departing of the swine, and for his courtesy and ravin he has hurt and shame.’

“Alas there be many wolves now a days that, without right and reason, destroy and eat them that they may have the overhand of. They spare neither flesh nor blood, friend nor enemy. What they can get that take they. O, woe be to that land and to towns where as the wolves have the overhand!

“My lord, this and many other good thing have I done for you, that I could well tell if it were not too long, of which now you remember little by the words I hear of you. If you would all thing oversee well, you would not say as you do. I have seen the day that there should no great matter be concluded in this Court without my advice. Albeit that this adventure is now fallen, it might happen yet that my words shall be heard and also believed as well as another's, as far as right will, for I desire none other. For if there be any can say and make good by sufficient witnesses that I have trespassed, I will abide all the right and law that may come thereof; and if any say on me anything of which he can bring no witnesses, let me then be ruled after the law and custom of this court.”

The King said,“Reynart, you say reasonably. I know not of Cuwart's death more than that Bellyn the Ram brought his head hither in the male. Thereof I let you go quit, for I have no witness thereof.”

“My dear lord,”said Reynart,“God thank you. Sykerly you do well. For his death makes me so sorrowful that methinks my heart will break in two. Oh, when they departed from me, my heart was so heavy that I should have swooned. I wot well it was a token of the loss that tho was so nigh coming to me.”

All the most part of them that were there and heard the Fox's words of the jewels, and how he made his countenance and stretched him, had verily supposed that it had not be feigned but that it had be true. They were sorry of his loss and misadventure, and also of his sorrow. The King and the Queen had both pity of him, and bade him to make not too much sorrow, but that he should endeavour him to seek them. For he had so much praised them that they had great will and desire to have them. And because he had made them to understand that he had sent these jewels to them, though they never had them yet they thanked him, and prayed him to help that they might have them.

The Fox understood their meaning well, he thought toward them but little good for all that. He said,“God thank you, my lord and my lady, that you so friendly comfort me in my sorrow. I shall not rest night nor day, nor all they that will do anything for me, but run, and pray, threaten, and ask all the four corners of the world, though I should ever seek, till that I know where they are become. And I pray you, my Lord the King, that if they were in such place as I could not get them by prayer, by might, nor by request, that you would assist me and abide by me; for it touches yourself, and the good is yours; and also it is your part to do justice on theft and murder, which both are in this case.”

“Reynart,”said the King,“that shall I not leave, when you know where they are. My help shall be alway ready for you.”

“Oh, dear lord, this is too much presented to me. If I had power and might I should deserve against you.”

Now has the Fox his matter fast and fair, for he has the King in his hand as he would. Him thought that he was in better case than it was like to have be; he has made so many leasings that he may go freely where he will, without complaining of any of them all, save of Esegrim, which was to himward angry and displeased, and said,“O noble King, are you so much childish that you believe this false and subtle shrew, and suffer yourself with false lies thus to be deceived? Of faith it should be long or I should believe him, he is in murder and treason all bewrapped, and he mocks you before your visage. I shall tell him another tale. I am glad that I see now him here. All his leasings shall not avail him ere he depart from me.”

CHAPTER XXXIII


“MY lord, I pray you to take heed. This false thief betrayed my wife once foul and dishonestly. It was so that in a winter's day they went together through a great water, and he bare my wife an honde that he would teach her take fish with her tail, and that she should let it hang in the water a good while and there should so much fish cleave on it that four of them should not conne eat it. The fool, my wife, supposed he had said truth. And she went in the mire ere she came into the water, and when she was in the deepest of the water he bade her hold her tail till that the fish were come. She held her tail so long that it was frozen hard in the ice and could not pluck it out. And when he saw that, he sprang up after on her body. She could not defend herself, the silly beast, she stood so deep in the mire. Hereof he cannot say nay, for I found him with the deed. Alas, what pain suffered I tho at my heart! I had almost for sorrow lost my five wits, and cried as loud as I might, and when he saw me so nigh he went his way. I went to her in a great heaviness, and went deep in that mire and that water ere I could break the ice, and much pain suffered she ere she could have out her tail, and yet left a gobbet of her tail behind her. And we were like both thereby to have lost our lives, for she yelped and cried so loud for the smart that she had ere she came out, that the men of the village came out, with staves and bills, with flail and pickforks, and the wives with their distaffs, and cried despitously,‘Slay! slay! and smite down right!’I was never in my life so afraid, for uneasily we escape. We ran so fast that we sweat. There was a villain that stake on us with a pike which hurted us sore; he was strong and swift a foot. Had it not be night, certainly we had been slain. The foul old queans would fain have beaten us. They said that we had bitten their sheep. They cursed us with many a curse. Tho came we in a field full of broom and brambles, there hid we us from the villains, and they durst not follow us further by night, but returned home again. See my lord this foul matter. You ought to do justice thereon sharply.”

Reynart answered and said,“If this were true, it should go too nigh my honour and worship. God forbid that it should be found true! It is well true that I taught her how she should in a place catch fish, and showed her a good way for to go over into the water without going into the mire. But she ran so desirously when she heard me name the fish, that she neither way nor path held, but went into the ice wherein she was forfrorn. And that was because she abode too long. She had fish enough, if she could have be pleased with measure. It falls oft, who that would have all loses all. Over covetous was never good. For the beast cannot be satisfied, and when I saw her in the ice so fast I went to have holpen her, and to have brought her out, but it was all pain lost, for she was too heavy for me. Tho came Esegrim, and saw how I did all my best, and he, as a foul churl, foul and rybadously slanders me with her, as these foul unthrifts are wont to do. But, my dear Lord, it was none otherwise. He belies me falsely. Peradventure his eyes dazzled as he looked from above down. He cried and cursed me, and swore many an oath I should dear abyou it. When I heard him so curse and threaten I went my way, and let him curse and threaten till he was weary. And tho went he and help his wife out, and then he leapt and ran, and she also, for to get them an heat and to warm them, or else they should have died for cold. And whatsomever I have said, afore or after, that is clearly all truth. I would not for a thousand mark of fine gold lie to you one leasing. It were not fitting for me. Whatsomever fall of me, I shall say the truth, like as my elders have always done since the time that we first understood reason. And if you be in doubt of anything that I have said otherwise than truth, give me respite of eight days, that I may have counsel, and I shall bring such information with good true and sufficient record that you shall all your life during trust and believe me, and so shall all your council also. What have I to do with the Wolf? It is before clearly enough showed that he is a foul villainous caitiff, and an unclean beast, when he dealed and departed the swine. So it is now known to you all by his own words, that he is a defamer of women as much as in him is, you may well mark euerychone. Now ask you his wife if it be so as he says. If she will say the truth I wot well she shall say as I do.”

Tho spake Ersewynde the Wolf's wife,“Ach, fell Reynart, no man can keep himself from thee, —thou canst so well utter thy words and thy falseness and reason set forth. But it shall be evil rewarded in the end. How broughtest thou me once into the well, where the two buckets hung by one cord running through one pulley, which went one up and another down, thou sattest in that one bucket beneath in the pit in great dread. I came thither and heard thee sigh and make sorrow, and asked thee how thou camest there. Thou saidst that thou hadst there so many good fishes eaten out of the water that thy belly would burst. I said,‘Tell me how I shall come to thee.’Then saidst thou,‘Aunt, spring into that bucket that hangs there, and you shall come anon to me.’I did so; and I went downward, and you came upward. Tho was I all angry. Thou saidst,‘Thus fares the world, that one goes up and another goes down.’Tho sprang you forth and went your way, and I abode there alone, sitting an whole day sore and hungered and a cold; and thereto had I many a stroke ere I could get thence.”

“Auntie,”said the Fox,“though the strokes did you harm, I had liever you had them than I, for you may better bear them; for one of us must needs have had them. I taught you good, will you understand it and think on it, that you another time take better heed and believe no man over hastily, is he friend or cousin, for every man seeks his own profit. They be now fools that do not so, and specially when they be in jeopardy of their lives.”





CHAPTER XXXIV


“MY Lord,”said Dame Ersewynde,“I pray you hear how he can blow with all winds, and how fair brings he his matters forth.”

“Thus has he brought me many time in scathe and hurt,”said the Wolf.“He has once betrayed me to the She Ape, my aunt, where I was in great dread and fear, for I left there almost my one ear. If the Fox will tell it, how it befel, I will give him the fordele thereof, for I cannot tell it so well but he shall beryspe me.”

“Well,”said the Fox,“I shall tell it without stammering. I shall say the truth. I pray you hearken me. He came into the wood and complained to me that he had great hunger; for I saw him never so full but he would alway have had fain more. I have wonder where the meat becomes that he destroys. I see now on his countenance that he begins to grymme for hunger. When I heard him so complain, I had pity of him. And I said, I was also hungry. Then went we half a day together and found nothing. Tho whined he and cried, and said he might go no further. Then espied I a great hole, standing in the middis(1) under an hawe which was thick of brambles, and I heard a rushing therein, I wist not what it was. Then said I,‘Go therein and look if there be anything there for us; I wot well there is somewhat.’Tho said he,‘Cousin, I would not creep into that hole for twenty pound, but(2) I wist(3) first what is therein. Methinks that there is some perilous thing. But I shall abide here under this tree, if you will go therein before. But come anon again, and let me wete(4) what thing is therein. You can many a subtlety, and can well help yourself, and much better than I.’See my Lord the King, thus he made me, poor wight, to go before into the danger, and he, which is great, long, and strong, abode without and rested him in peace. Await if I did not for him, there. I would not suffer the dread and fear that I there suffered, for all the good in earth, but if I wist how to escape. I went hardily in. I found the way dark, long, and broad. Ere I right in the hole came, so espied I a great light which came in from that one side. There lay in a great Ape with two great wide eyes, and they glimmed as a fire; and she had a great mouth with long teeth, and sharp nails on her feet and on her hands; I weened it had be a mermouse, a baubyn, or a mercatte, for I saw never fouler beast. And by her lay three of her children, which were right foul, for they were right like the mother. When they saw me come, they gapeden wide on me and were all still. I was afraid and would well I had been thence; but I thought, I am therein, I must there through, and come out as well as I may. As I saw her, me thought she seemed more(5) than Esegrim the Wolf, and her children were more than I. I saw never a fouler meyne.(6) They lay on foul hay which was all bepissed. They were beslabbed and beclagged to their ears too in her own dung. It stank that I was almost smothered thereof. I durst not say but good, and then I said,‘Aunt, God give you good day, and all my cousins, your fair children, they be of their age the fairest that ever I saw. O, Lord God, how well please they me! how lovely! how fair be they! Each of them for their beauty might be a great king's son! Of right we ought to thank you, that you thus increase our lineage. Dear Aunt, when I heard say that you were delivered and laid down I could no longer abide, but must come and friendly visit you. I am sorry that I had not erst known it.’‘Reynart, cousin,’said she,‘you be welcome. For that you have found me, and thus come see me, I thank you. Dear cousin, you be right true, and named right wise in all lands, and also that you gladly further and bring your lineage in great worship. You must teach my children with yours some wisdom, that they may know what they shall do and leave. I have thought on you, for gladly you go and fellowship with the good.’Oh how well was I pleased when I heard these words. This deserved I at the beginning when I called her aunt; howbeit that she was nothing sybbe to me; for my right Aunt is Dame Rukenawe that yonder stands, which is wont to bring forth wise children. I said,‘Aunt, my life and my good is at your commandment, and what I may do for you by night and by day. I will gladly teach them all that I can.’I would fain have be thence for the stench of them; and also I had pity of the great hunger that Esegrim had. I said,‘Aunt, I shall commit you and your fair children to God and take my leave. My wife shall think long after me.’‘Dear cousin,’said she,‘you shall not depart till you have eaten; for if you did I would say you were not kind.’Tho stood she up and brought me in another hole, whereas was much meat of harts and hinds, roes, pheasants, partridges, and much other venison, that I wondered from whence all this meat might come. And when I had eaten my bellyful, she gave me a great piece of an hind for to eat with my wife and with my household when I come home. I was ashamed to take it, but I might none otherwise do. I thanked her and took my leave. She bade me I should come soon again. I said I would, and so departed thence merrily that I so well had sped. I hasted me out, and when I came, saw Esegrim which lay groaning. And I asked him how he fared. He said,‘Nephew, all evil, for it is wonder that I live. Bring you any meat to eat? I die for hunger.’Tho had I compassion of him and gave him that I had, and saved him there his life; whereof then he thanked me greatly, howbeit that he now owes me evil will. He had eaten this up anon, tho said he,‘Reynart, dear cousin, what found you in that hole? I am more hungry now than I was before. My teeth are now sharped to eat.’I said then,‘Eme, haste you then lightly into that hole. You shall find there enough. There lies my Aunt with her children; if you will spare the truth, and lie great leasings, you shall have there all your desire. But and you say truth, you shall take harm.’My Lord, was not this enough said and warned, who so would understand it, that all that he found, he should say the contrary. But rude and plump beasts cannot understand wisdom; therefore hate they all subtle inventions, for they cannot conceive them. Yet nevertheless, he said he would go in, and lie so many leasings, ere he should mishap, that all men should have wonder of it; and so went forth into that foul stinking hole, and found the marmosette. She was like the devil's daughter, and on her hung much filth clottered in gobbets. Tho cried he,‘Alas, me growls of these foul nickers! Come they out of hell? Men may make devils afraid of them. Go and drown them, that evil might they fear! I saw never fouler worms, they make all my hair to stand right up.’‘Sir Esegrim,’said she,‘what may I do thereto? They are my children, and I must be their mother. What lies that in your way, whether they be foul or fair? They have you nothing cost. Here has been one to-day before you which was to them nigh of kin, and was your better and wiser; and he said that they were fair. Who has sent you hither with these tidings?’‘Dame, will you wit, I will eat of your meat. It is better bestowed on me than on these foul wights.’She said,‘Here is no meat.’He said,‘Here is enough.’And therewith he stert with his head toward the meat, and would have gone into the hole where the meat was. But my aunt stert up with her children, and run to him with their sharp long nails so sore that the blood ran over his eyes. I heard him cry sore and howl, but I know of no defence that he made but that he ran fast out of the hole. And he was there scratched and beaten, and many an hole had they made in his coat and skin. His visage was all on a blood and almost he had lost his one ear. He groaned and complained to me sore: then asked I him if he had well lied. He said,‘I said like as I saw and found, and that was a foul beast with many foul wights.’‘Nay, Eme,’said I,‘you should have said Fair niece how fare you and your fair children which are my wellbeloved cousins?’The Wolf said,‘I had liefer that they were hanged ere I that said.’‘Yea, Eme, therefore must you receive such manner payment. It is better otherwhile to lie than to say truth. They that are better wiser and stronger than we be have done so before us.’See, my Lord the King, thus got he his red coif. Now stands he all so simply as he knew no harm. I pray you ask you him if it was not thus. He was not far off, if I wot it well.”

CHAPTER XXXV


THE Wolf said,“I may well forbear your mocks and your scorns and also your fell venomous words, strong thief that you are. You said that I was almost dead for hunger, when you help me in my need. That is falsely lied, for it was but a bone that you gave to me, you had eaten away all the flesh that was thereon. And you mock me and say that I am hungry, here where I stand. That touches my worship too nigh, —what many a spity word have you brought forth with false leasings!—and that I have conspired the King's death, from the treasure that you have said to him is in Hulsterlo, —and you have also my wife shamed and slandered that she shall never recover it, and I should ever be disworshipped thereby if I avenged it not. I have forborne you long, but now you shall not escape me. I can not make hereof great proof, but I say here before my lord and before all them that are here that thou art a false traitor and a murderer, and that I shall prove and make good on thy body within lists in the field, and that body against body, and then shall our strife have an end. And thereto I cast to thee my glove, and take thou it up I shall have right of thee or die therefor.”

Reynart the Fox thought, How come I on this campaign? we are not both like. I shall not well conne stand against this strong thief. All my proof is now come to an end.





CHAPTER XXXVI


YET thought the Fox I have good advantage: the claws of his forefeet are off, and his feet are yet sore thereof, when for my sake he was unshoed. He shall be somewhat the weaker.

Then said the Fox,“Who that says that I am a traitor or a murderer, I say he lies falsely; and that art thou specially Esegrim. Thou bringest me there as I would be. This have I oft desired. Lo here is my pledge that all thy words are false, and that I shall defend me and make good that thou liest.”

The King received the pledges, and admitted the battle, and asked borowes(1) of them both that on the morn they should come and perform their battle, and do as they ought to do. Then the Bear and the Cat were borowes for the Wolf; and for the Fox were borowes Grymbart the Dasse and Byteluys.

CHAPTER XXXVII


THE She Ape said to the Fox,“Reynart Nephew, see that you take heed in your battle. Be cold and wise. Your Eme taught me once a prayer that is of much virtue to him that shall fight; and a great master and a wise clerk, and was abbot of Boudelo, that taught him, he said, who that said devoutly this prayer fasting shall not that day be overcome in battle nor in fighting. Therefore, dear Nephew, be not afraid, I shall read it over you to-morrow, then may you be sure enough of the Wolf. It is better to fight than to have the neck asunder.”

“I thank you, dear aunt,”said the Fox.“The quarrel that I have is rightful, therefore I hope I shall speed well, and that shall greatly be my help.”

All his lineage abode by him all the night and holp him to drive away the time.

Dame Rukenawe the She Ape, his aunt, thought alway on his profit and fordele. And she did all his hair from the head to the tail be shorn off smooth; and she anointed all his body with oil of olive; and then was his body also glat(1) and slipper that the Wolf should have none hold on him. And he was round and fat also on his body.

And she said to him,“Dear cousin, you must now drink much that to-morrow you may the better make your urine; but you shall hold it in till you come to the field. And when need is and time, so shall you piss full your rough tail and smite the Wolf therewith in his beard. And if you might hit him therewith in his eyes, then shall you byneme him(2) his sight. That should much hinder him. But else, hold alway your tail fast between your legs that he catch you not thereby; and hold down your ears lying plat after your head that he hold you not thereby; and see wisely to yourself. And at beginning flee from his strokes, and let him spring and run after you, and run before where as most dust is, and stir it with your feet that it may flee in his eyes, and that shall much hinder his sight. And while he rubs his eyes, take your advantage and smite and bite him there as you may most hurt him, and alway to hit him with your tail full of piss in his visage, and that shall make him so woe that he shall not wit where he is. And let him run after you for to make him weary. Yet his feet are sore of that you made him to lose his shoes, and though he be great he has no heart. Nephew, certainly this is my counsel. The connyng goes before strength; therefore see for yourself, and set yourself wisely at defence, that you and we all may have worship thereof. I would be sorry if you mishapped. I shall teach you the words that your Eme Martin taught me, that you may overcome your enemy, as I hope you shall do without doubt.”Therewith she laid her hand upon his head, and said these words:“Blaerde Shay Alphenio Kasbue Gorfons Alsbuifrio. Nephew, now be you sure from all mischief and dread. And I counsel you that you rest you a little, for it is by the day you shall be the better disposed; we shall awake you in all in time.”

“Aunt,”said the Fox,“I am now glad. God thank you, you have done to me such good I can never deserve it fully again. Methinks there may nothing hurt me since that you have said these holy words over me.”

Tho went he and laid him down under a tree in the grass, and slept till the sun was risen. Tho came the Otter and waked him, and bade him arise, and gave him a good young duck and said,“Dear cousin, I have this night made many a leap in the water ere I could get this young fat duck. I have taken it from a fowler. Take and eat it.”

Reynart said,“This is good handsel. If I refused I were a fool. I thank you, cousin, that you remember me. If I live I shall reward you.”

The Fox ate the duck without sauce or bread. It savoured him well, and went well in. And he drank thereto four great draughts of water. Then went he to the battle ward, and all they that loved him went with him.

CHAPTER XXXVIII


WHEN the King saw Reynart thus shorn and oiled he said to him,“Ey, Fox, how well can you see for yourself!”

He wondered thereof; he was foul to look on.

But the Fox said not one word, but kneeled down low to the earth unto the King and to the Queen, and striked him forth into the field.

The Wolf was there ready and spake many a proud word. The rulers and keepers of the field were the Leopard and the Losse.(1) They brought forth the book on which sware the Wolf that the Fox was a traitor and a murderer, and none might be falser than he was, and that he would prove on his body and make it good. Reynart the Fox sware that he lied as a false knave and a cursed thief, and that he would do good on his body.

When this was done, the governors of the field bade them do their devoir. Then roomed they all the field, save Dame Rukenawe the She Ape, she abode by the Fox and bade him remember well the words that she had said to him. She said,“See well to. When you were seven years old you were wise enough to go by night without lantern or moonshine where you wist to win any good. You are named among the people wise and subtle. Pain yourself to work so that you win the prize, then may you have ever honour and worship, and all we that are your friends.”

He answered,“My dearest aunt, I know it well. I shall do my best, and think on your counsel. I hope so to do that all my lineage shall have worship thereby, and my enemies shame and confusion.”

She said,“God grant it you.”

CHAPTER XXXIX


THEREWITH she went out of the field and let them two go together. The Wolf trode forth to the Fox in great wrath, and opened his forefeet, and supposed to have taken the Fox in them. But the Fox sprang from him lightly, for he was lighter to foot than he. The Wolf sprang after, and hunted the Fox sore. Their friends stood without the lists and looked upon them. The Wolf strode wider than Reynart did, and oft overtook him, and lift up his foot and weened to have smitten him. But the Fox saw to, and smote him with his rough tail, which he had all bepissed, in his visage. Tho weened the Wolf to have been plat blind; the piss started in his eyes. Then must he rest, for to make clean his eyes. Reynart thought on his fordele, and stood above the wind scraping and casting with his feet the dust, that it flew the Wolf's eyesful. The Wolf was sore blinded therewith, in such wise that he must leave the running after him, for the sand and piss cleaved under his eyes, that it smarted so sore that he must rub and wash it away.

Tho came Reynart in a great anger and bote(1) him three great wounds on his head with his teeth, and said,“What is that, Sir Wolf! Has one there bitten you? How is it with you? I will all otherwise on you yet. Abide. I shall bring you some new thing. You have stolen many a lamb, and destroyed many a simple beast, and now falsely have appealed me and brought me in this trouble. All this shall I now avenge on thee. I am chosen to reward thee for thine old sins, for God will no longer suffer thee in thy great raven and shrewdness. I shall now assoil thee, and that shall be good for thy soul. Take patiently this penance, for thou shalt live no longer. The hell shall be thy purgatory. Thy life is now in my mercy, but and if thou wilt kneel down and ask me forgiveness, and knowledge thee to be overcome, yet though thou be evil, yet I will spare thee. For my conscience counsels me I should not gladly slay no man.”

Esegrim weened with these mocking and spiteous words to have gone out of his wits; and that dered(2) him so much that he wist not what to say, buff nor haft, he was so angry in his heart. The wounds that Reynart had given him bled and smarted sore, and he thought how he might best avenge it. With great anger he lift up his foot and smote the Fox on the head so great a stroke that he fell to the ground. Tho stert the Wolf to, and weened to have taken him. But the Fox was light and wily, and rose lightly up, and met with him fiercely. And there began a fell battle which dured long. The Wolf had great spite on the Fox, as well it seemed. He sprang after him ten times each after other, and would fain have had him fast. But his skin was so slipper and fat of the oil, that alway he escaped from him. O, so subtle and snelle(3) was the Fox, that many times when the Wolf weened well to make sure of him, he stert then between his legs and under his belly, and then turned he again and gave the Wolf a stroke with his tail in his eyes, that Esegrim weened he should have lost his sight, and this did he often times. And alway when he had so smitten him, then would he go above the wind and raise the dust, that it made his eyes full of stuffs. Esegrim was woebegone, and thought he was at an afterdele;(4) yet was his strength and might much more than the Fox's. Reynart had many a sore stroke of him when he raught(5) him. They gave each other many a stroke and many a bite when they saw their advantage, and each of them did his best to destroy that other. I would I might see such a battle. That one was wily, and that other was strong. That one fought with strength, and that other with subtlety.

The Wolf was angry that the Fox endured so long against him. If his foremost feet had been whole, the Fox had not endured so long; but the sores were so open that he might not well run. And the Fox might better off and on than he, and also he swang his tail oft under his eyes, and made him that him thought that his eyes should go out. At last he said to himself, I will make an end of this battle. How long shall this caitiff dure thus against me? I am so great, I should, if I lay upon him, press him to death. It is to me a great shame that I spare him so long. Men shall mock and point me with fingers to my shame and rebuke, for I am yet on the worst side. I am sore wounded; I bleed sore; and he drowns me with his piss and casts so much dust and sand in my eyes that hastily I shall not conne see, if I suffer him any longer. I will set it in adventure and seen what shall come thereof.

With that he smote with his foot Reynart on the head that he fell down to the ground, and ere he could arise he caught him in his feet and lay upon him as he would have pressed him to death. Tho began the Fox to be afraid, and so were all his friends when they saw him lie under. And on that other side all Esegrim's friends were joyful and glad. The Fox defended him fast with his claws as he lay upward with his feet, and gave many a clope.(6) The Wolf durst not with his feet do him much harm, but with his teeth snatched at him as he would have bitten him. When the Fox saw that he should be bitten and was in great dread, he smote the Wolf in the head with his foremost claws and tare the skin off between his brows and his ears, and that one of his eyes hung out; which did him much pain. He howled, he wept, he cried loud, and made a piteous noise, for the blood ran down as it had been a stream.

CHAPTER XL


THE Wolf wiped his eyes, the Fox was glad when he saw that. He wrestled so sore, that he sprang on his feet while he rubbed his eyes. The Wolf was not well pleased therewithal, and smote after him ere he escaped, and caught him in his arms, and held him fast, notwithstanding that he bled. Reynard was woe then. There wrestled they long and sore. The Wolf waxed so angry that he forgot all his smarts and pain, and threw the Fox all plat under him, which came him evil to pass, for his one hand, by which he defended him stert in the falling into Esegrim's throat, and then was he afraid to lose his hand.

The Wolf said tho to the Fox,“Now choose, whether you will yield you as overcome or else I shall certainly slay you. Thy scattering of the dust, thy piss, thy mocking, nor thy defence, nor all thy false wiles, may not now help thee. Thou mayest not escape me. Thou hast heretofore done me so much harm and shame, and now I have lost my one eyou and thereto sore wounded.”

When Reynart heard that it stood so rowme(1) that he should choose to knowledge him overcome and yield him or else to take the death, he thought the choice was worth ten mark, and that he must say that one or that other. He had anon concluded what he would say, and began to say to him with fair words in this wise:

“Dear Eme, I will gladly become your man with all my good. And I will go for you to the holy grave, and shall get pardon and winning for your cloister of all the churches that are in the holy land, which shall much profit to your soul and your elders' souls also. I think there was never such a proffer proffered to any king. And I shall serve you like as I should serve our holy father the Pope. I shall hold of you all that I have, and ever been your servant, and forth I shall make that all my lineage shall do in like wise. Then shall you be a lord above all lords. Who should then dare do anything against you? And furthermore whatsomever I take of polaille, geese, partridge, or plover, fish or flesh, or whatsomever it be, thereof shall you first have the choice, and your wife and your children, ere any come in my body. Thereto I will alway abide by you, that where you be there shall no hurt nor scathe come to you. You be strong, and I am wily: let us abide together that, one with the counsel and that other with the deed, then may there nothing misfall to usward. And we are so nigh of kin each to other that of right should be no anger between us. I would not have foughten against you if I might have escaped. But you appealed me first unto fight, tho must I do that I not do would gladly. And in this battle I have been curtoys to you, I have not showed the utterest of my might on you like as I would have done if you had been a stranger to me; for the Nephew ought to spare the Eme, it is good reason and it ought so to be. Dear Eme, so have I now do, and that may you mark well when I ran before you, my heart would not consent thereto. For I might have hurt you much more than I did, but I thought it never; for I have not hurt you, nor done you so much harm that may hinder you, save only that mishap that is fallen on your eye. Ach! therefore I am sorry, and suffer much sorrow in my heart. I would well, dear Eme, that it had not happed you, but that it had fallen on me, so that you therewith had been pleased; howbeit that you shall have thereby a great advantage. For when you hereafter sleep you need not to shut but one window where another must shut two. My wife and my children and my lineage shall fall down to your feet, before the King and before all them that you will, desire and pray you humbly that you will suffer Reynart, your nephew, live; and also I shall knowledge oft to have trespassed against you, and what leasings I have lied upon you. How might any lord have more honour than I proffer you. I would for no good do this to another. Therefore I pray you to be pleased herewithall. I wote well, if you would, you might have slew me; but and you so done had, what had you won? So must you ever after this time keep you from my friends and lineage. Therefore he is wise that can in his anger measure himself, and not be over hasty, and to see well what may fall or happe afterward to him. What man that in his anger can well advise him, certainly he is wise. Men find many fools that in heat hasten them so much that after they repent them and then it is too late. But, dear Eme, I think you be too wise so to do. It is better to have praise, honour, rest, and peace, and many friends that be ready to help him, than to have shame, hurt, unrest, and also many enemies lying in a wait to do him harm. Also it is little worship to him that has overcome a man then to slay him. It is great shame, not for my life, though I were dead that were a little hurt.”

Esegrim the Wolf said,“Ay, thief, how fain wouldest thou be loosed and discharged from me, that hear I well by thy words. Were thou now from me on thy free feet thou wouldst not set by me an egg shell. Though thou promisedst to me all the world of fine red gold, I would not let thee escape. I set little by thee and all thy friends and lineage. All that thou hast here said is but leasings and feigned falseness. Weenest thou thus to deceive me? it is long since that I knew thee. I am no bird to be locked, nor take by chaff. I know well enough good corn. O, how wouldest thou mock me if I let thee thus escape. Thou mightest well have said this to one that knew thee not, but to me thou losest thy flattering and sweet fluting, for I understand too well thy subtle lying tales. Thou hast so oft deceived me that me behoves now to take good heed of thee. Thou false stinking knave, thou sayest that thou hast spared me in this battle. Look hitherward to me. Is not my one eyou out? And thereto hast thou wounded me in twenty places in my head. Thou wouldest not suffer me so long to rest as to take once my breath. I were over much a fool if I should now spare thee or be merciful to thee. So many a confusion and shame as thou hast done to me; and that also that touches me most of all, that thou hast disworshipped me and sklaundred Ersewynde my wife, whom I love as well as myself, and falsely deceivedst her, which shall never out of my heart: for as oft as it comes to my mind all my anger and hate that I have to thee renews.”

In the meanwhile that Esegrim was thus speaking, the Fox bethought him how he might help himself, and stuck his other hand after between his legs, and grepe the Wolf fast. And he wrong him so sore that for woe and pain he must cry loud and howl. Then the Fox drew his other hand out of his mouth. The Wolf had so much pain and anguish of the sore wringing, that he spit blood.

CHAPTER XLI


THIS pain did him more sorrow and woe than his eyou did that so sore bled, and also it made him to overthrow all in a swoon. Then Reynart the Fox leapt upon him with all his might, and caught him by the legs, and drew him forth through the field that they all might see it, and he stack and smote him sore. Then were Esegrim's friends all full of sorrow, and went all weeping unto their Lord the King, and prayed him that he would do cease the battle, and take it up into his hand.

The King granted it. And then went the keepers of the field the Leopard and the Lossem and said to the Fox and to the Wolf,“Our Lord the King will speak with you, and will that this battle be ended. He will take it into his hand. He desires that you will give your strife unto him, for if any of you here were slain it should be great shame on both sides. For you have as much worship of this field as you may have.”

And they said to the Fox,“All the beasts give to you the prize that have seen this battle.”

The Fox said,“Thereof I thank them, and what that shall please my lord to command that shall not I gainsay. I desire no better but to have won the field. Let my friends come hither to me. I will take advice of them what I shall do.”

They said,“That they thought it good; and also it was reason in weighty matters a man should take advice of his friends.”

Then came Dame Slopecade and Grymbart the Dasse her husband, Dame Rukenawe with her two sisters, Byteluys and Fulrompe her two sons and Hatenit her daughter, the Flyndermows(1) and the Weasel. And there came more than twenty which would not have come if the Fox had lost the field. So who that winns and comes to hys aboue, he gets great loos and worship: and who that is overthrown and has the worse, to him will no man gladly come. There came also to the Fox the Beaver, the Otter and both their wives Panthecrote and Ordegale. And the Ostrole, the Marten, the Fitchews, the Ferret, the Mouse, and the Squirrel, and many more than I can name. And all because he had won the field. Yea some came that before had complained on him, and were now of his next kin, and they showed him right friendly cheer and countenance. Thus fares the world now. Who that is rich and high on the wheel, he has many kinsmen and friends that shall help to bear out his wealth but who that is needy and in pain or in poverty finds but few friends and kinsmen; for every man almost eschews his company and way.

There was then great feast. They blew up trumpets and piped with shalmoyses.

They said all,“Dear Nephew, blessed be God that you have sped well. We were in great dread and fear when we saw you lie under.”

Reynart the Fox thanked all them friendly, and received them with great joy and gladness. Then he asked of them what they counselled him. If he should give the field unto the King or no?

Dame Slopecade said,“Yea hardily cousin. You may with worship well set it in to his hands, and trust him well enough.”

Tho went they all with the keepers of the field unto the King. And Reynart the Fox went before them all, with trumpets and pipes and much other minstrelsy. The Fox kneeled down before the King.

The King bade him stand up, and said to him,“Reynart you be now joyful. You have kept your day worshipfully. I discharge you, and let you go freely quit where it pleases you. And the debate between you, I hold it on me, and shall discuss it by reason and by counsel of noble men, and will ordain thereof that ought be done by reason, at such time as Esegrim shall be whole. And then I shall send for you to come to me, and then by God's grace I shall give out the sentence and judgment.”

CHAPTER XLII


“MY worthy and dear Lord the King,”said the Fox,“I am well agreed and paid therewith. But when I came first into your Court there were many that were fell and envious to me, which never had hurt nor cause of scathe by me. But they thought that they might best over me, and all they crieden with my enemies against me and would fain have destroyed me, because they thought that the Wolf was better withholden and greater with you than I was, which am your humble subject. They knew none other thing, why nor wherefore. They thought not as the wise be wont to do, that is what the end may happen.

“My lord these are like a great heap of hounds which I once saw stand at a lord's place upon a dunghill, whereas they awaited that men should bring them meat. Then saw they an hound come out of the kitchen and had taken there a fair rib of beef ere it was given him. And he ran fast away withal; but the cook had espied or(1) he went away, and took a great bowl full of scalding water and cast it on his hips behind; whereof he thanked nothing the cook, for the hair behind was scalded off and his skin seemed as it had be through sodden. Nevertheless he escaped away and kept that he had won.

“And when his fellows the other hounds saw him come with this fair rib, they called him all and said to him,‘Oh how good a friend is the cook to thee, which has given to thee so good a bone, whereon is so much flesh.’

“The hound said,‘You know nothing thereof. You praise me like as you see me before with the bone. But you have not seen me behind. Take heed, and behold me afterward on my buttocks, and then you shall know how I deserved it.’

“And when they had seen him behind on his hips how that his skin and his flesh was all raw and through sodden, tho growled they all and were afraid of that syedyng water; and would not of his fellowship, but fled and ran away from him, and let him there alone.

“See, my Lord, this right have these false beasts. When they be made lords, and may get their desire, and when they be mighty and doubted,(2) then have been they extortioners and scatte and pylle the people and eaten them like as they were forhungred hounds. These are they that bear the bone in their mouth. No man dare have to do with them, but preyse all that they bedrive.(3) No man dare say otherwise but such as shall please them, because they would not be shorn. And some help them forth in their unrighteous deeds because they would not have part, and lick their fingers, and strengthe them in their evil life and works. O, dear Lord, how little seen they that do thus after behind them, what the end shall be at last. They fall from high to low in great shame and sorrow, and then their works come to knowledge and be open in such wise that no man has pity nor compassion on them in their mischief and trouble, and every man curse them and say evil by them to their shame and villainy. Many of such have been blamed and shorn full nigh, that they had no worship nor profit but lose their hair as the hound did, that is their friends which have help them to cover their misdeeds and extortions like as the hair covers the skin. And when they have sorrow and shame for their old trespasses, then each body plucks his hand from him, and flee, like as the hounds did from him that was scalded with the syedyng water, and let him these extortions in their sorrow and need.

“My dear Lord King, I beseech you to remember this example of me; it shall not be against your worship nor wisdom. What ween you how many are there such false extortioners now in these days, —yea much worse than an hound that bears such a bone in his mouth—in towns, in great lords' courts, which with great facing and bracing oppress the poor people with great wrong, and sell their freedom and privileges, and bear them on hand of things that they never knew nor thought, and all for to get good for their singular profit. God give them all shame, and soon destroy them, whosomever they be that so do!

“But God be thanked,”said the Fox,“there may no man indite me, nor lineage, nor kin, of such works, but that we shall acquit us, and come in the light. I am not afraid of any that can say on me any thing that I have done otherwise than a true man ought to do. Alway the Fox shall abide the Fox, though all his enemies had sworn the contrary. My dear Lord the King, I love you with my heart above all lords, and never for no man would I turn from you, but abide by you to the utterest. How well it has been otherwise informed your highness, I have nevertheless alway do the best, and forth so will do, all my life that I can or may.”

CHAPTER XLIII


THE King said,“Reynart, you be one of them that owes me homage; which I will that you alway so do. And also I will that, early and late, you be of my council and one of my justices. See well to that you not misdo nor trespass no more. I set you again in all your might and power, like as you were before, and see that you further all matters to the best right. For when you set your wit and counsel to virtue and goodness, then may not our Court be without your advice and counsel, for here is none that is like to you in sharp and high counsel, nor subtler in finding a remedy for a mischief. And think you on the example that you yourself have told, and that you haunt righteousness and be to me true. I will from henceforth work and do by your advice and counsel. He lives not that if he misdid you, but I should sharply avenge and wreke it on him. You shall overall speak and say my words, and in all my land shall you be, above all other, sovereign and my bayle.(1) That office I give you. You may well occupy it with worship.”

All Reynart's friends and lineage thanketh the King highly.

The King said,“I would do more for your sake than you ween. I pray you all that you remember him that he be true.”

Dame Rukenawe then said,“Yes sykerly, my Lord, that shall he ever be, and think you not the contrary. For if he were otherwise, he were not of our kin nor lineage, and I would ever missake him, and would ever hinder him to my power.”

Reynart the Fox thanked the King with fair courteous words, and said,“Dear Lord, I am not worthy to have the worship that you do to me. I shall think thereon and be true to you all so long as I live, and shall give you as wholesome counsel as shall be expedient to your good grace.”

Herewith he departed with his friends from the King.

Now hark how Esegrim the Wolf did. Bruin the Bear, Tybert the Cat, and Ersewynde and her children with their lineage drewen the Wolf out of the field, and laid him upon a litter of hay, and covered him warm, and looked to his wounds which were well twenty-five. And there came wise masters and surgeons which bound them and wash them. He was so sick and feeble that he had lost his feeling, but they rubbed and wryued(2) him under his temples and eyes, that he sprang out of his swound, and cried so loud that all they were afraid. They had weened that he had been wood.(3) But the masters gave him a drink that comforted his heart and made him to sleep. They comforted his wife, and told to her that there was no death-wound nor peril of his life. Then the Court brake up; and the Beasts departed and went to their places and homes that they came from.

CHAPTER XLIV


REYNART the Fox took his leave honestly of the King and of the Queen. And they bade him he should not tarry long, but shortly return to them again. He answered and said,“Dear King and Queen, alway at your commandment I shall be ready, if you need anything, which God forbid. I would alway be ready with my body and my good to help you, and also all my friends and lineage in likewise shall obey your commandment and desire. You have highly deserved it, God quite it you, and give you grace long to live. And I desire your license and leave to go home to my wife and children. And if your good grace will anything, let me have knowledge of it, and you shall find me alway ready.”

Thus departed the Fox with fair words from the King.

Reynart's friends and lineage to the number of forty have taken also their leave of the King, and went all together with the Fox, which was right glad that he had so well sped and that he stood so well in the King's grace. He thought that he had no shame, but that he was so great with the King that he might help and further his friends, and hinder his enemies, and also to do what he would without he should be blamed; if he would be wise.

The Fox and his friends went so long together that they camen to his burgh to Malperdays, there they all took leave of each other with fair and courteous words. Reynart did to them great reverence, and thanked them all friendly of their good faith and also worship that they had done and showed to him. And proffered to each of them his service, if they had need, with body and goods. And herewith they departed, and each of them went to their own houses.

The Fox went to Dame Ermelyne his wife, which welcomed him friendly. He told to her and to his children all the wonder that to him was befallen in the Court, and forgot not a word, but told to them every deal how he had escaped. Then were they glad that their father was so enhanced and great with the King. And the Fox lived further with his wife and his children in great joy and gladness.
