林肯传


本书创作过程及原因


几年前的某个春日，我在伦敦的戴萨特酒店吃早饭。和往常一样，我翻着晨报，寻找着美国新闻的蛛丝马迹。通常来说我总是一无所获，但那天我很幸运，竟有了丰富的收获。

当时，已故的“下议院之父”——T. P.科诺（T. P. O'Connor）正负责晨报的一个专栏，名为“人物与回忆”。从那天开始，连着好几天，科诺在专栏里一心一意地讲述亚伯拉罕·林肯（Abraham Lincoln）的故事。科诺并不在意林肯从事的那些政治活动，而是着手讲述林肯职业生涯中与他的个人生活相关的故事：他的悲伤，他那接连不断的失败，他的贫穷，他对安·拉特利奇（Ann Rutledge）深沉的爱以及他和玛丽·托德（Mary Todd）悲剧的婚姻。

我颇有兴趣地读着这个系列，同时又感到十分惊讶。我从出生起到二十岁一直生活在离林肯县不远的中西部地区。此外，我一直对美国历史很感兴趣。我本以为自己非常了解林肯的故事，然而读着专栏里的文章时，我很快发现，事实并非如此。事实上，我作为一个美国人，却要在去了伦敦，读了一个爱尔兰人在英国报纸上写的专栏之后，才体会到林肯的一生是那么精彩，足以成为人类历史上的传奇。

我忍不住想，如此令人悲伤的无知，只属于我吗？这个问题没有困扰我太久，很快我就找到了答案。我与几个美国同胞讨论这件事，却发现他们对于林肯的认知，仅限于大家所知道的那些故事：林肯出生在小木屋内；白天步行数英里去借书，晚上躺在炉火前的地板上看书；砍柴；成了一名律师；会讲有趣的故事，还说一个人的腿只要能够到地面就行了；被称为“诚实的亚伯”；和道格拉斯法官辩论；被选为美国总统；戴一顶丝质礼帽；解放黑奴，在葛底斯堡发表演说；公开表示希望知道格兰特将军(1)喜欢什么牌子的威士忌，好让他给其他几位将军也寄一桶尝尝；在华盛顿的一家剧院里被布斯（Booth）枪杀。

晨报上的那些文章，激起了我对林肯的兴趣。我去了大英图书馆，阅读了很多关于林肯的书籍。读着读着，我便深深地被林肯迷住了，内心的火焰熊熊燃烧，终于，我决定自己写一本关于林肯的书。我很清楚，自己并没有那份动力、性情、素养或能力为学者和历史学家写一本学术专著。而且，我认为也没有必要再多一本这样的书——现有的优秀专著已经够多了。然而，在阅读了诸多林肯的资料后，我发自内心地认为，现如今忙碌的人们所需要的，是一本简洁明了的传记，一本能让人们了解林肯那丰富而有趣的一生的传记。而我，想写这样一本书。

我在欧洲开始了这本书的创作，并在那儿写了一年，随后回到纽约又写了两年。最终我撕掉了所有的稿件，把它们扔进了垃圾桶。之后我出发去了伊利诺伊州，去林肯曾经放飞梦想、辛劳工作过的地方写林肯。一连几个月，我与当地的百姓生活在一起——他们的父辈曾帮助林肯测量土地，修建篱笆，赶猪上集市。一连好几个月，我埋头钻研林肯时代的旧书、旧信、旧演讲稿，那些几乎被人遗忘的旧报纸和那散发着霉味的法庭记录，努力去理解林肯。

我在彼得斯堡（Petersburg）的小镇上待了一个夏天。之所以选择那里，是因为彼得斯堡距离重新修葺的新塞勒姆村（New Salem）只有一英里。在新塞勒姆村，林肯度过了一生中最快乐的日子。那段时光也是林肯性格形成的关键时期。在那里，他经营了一家小磨坊和一家杂货店，学习法律，做铁匠，玩斗鸡和赛马，坠入爱河随后又黯然心碎。

即便是在鼎盛时期，新塞勒姆村也没能壮大成为百人村。其存在时间，大约只有十年。林肯离开后，新塞勒姆村就被废弃了，只有蝙蝠和燕子在腐烂的小木屋中筑巢。在随后的半个多世纪中，那儿变成了放养奶牛的牧场。

然而，几年前，伊利诺伊州政府将这里保护了起来，建成了一个向公众开放的公园，并按照百年前的样子重建了村子里的屋舍。因此，被废弃的新塞勒姆村现在看起来和林肯时代的样子差不多。

白橡树屹立如初，林肯曾在树下学习、摔跤、追逐爱情。每天早上，我都会带着打字机，从彼得斯堡开车去那里。这本书一半的章节，都是在白橡树下完成的。在那里工作真是太惬意了！我的面前是蜿蜒流淌的桑加蒙河，北美鹑在四周的树林和草场里歌唱。冠蓝鸦的身影不时在林间闪现，还有金翼啄木鸟和红雀的倩影。我甚至能感觉到，林肯就在我身边。

我经常独自一人趁着夏天的夜色去那里。桑加蒙河畔的树林里，三声夜鹰的叫声如泣如诉。月光的清辉在黑暗中勾勒出了拉特利奇旅馆的轮廓。我的心被深深地触动了。一百年前，也是在这样的夜晚，年轻的林肯和安·拉特利奇也曾沐浴着月光，手挽手地走在这片土地上，听着夜莺的歌声，做着那些注定化为泡影的美梦。我相信，就是在新塞勒姆村，林肯度过了一生中绝无仅有的幸福时光。

当我准备写林肯的挚爱去世的这一章时，我将折叠桌和打字机放在车里，沿着乡村公路一路前行，穿过一片养猪场和一片奶牛场，最后来到了一处僻静的地方。在那里，埋葬着安·拉特利奇。如今，那里已是一片荒芜，到处野草丛生。我割掉了挡在前方的野草、灌木和藤蔓，来到了安的墓前。在这里，林肯曾伤心悲泣，而他那悲伤的故事，也由此开始。

本书的很多章节都是在春田市（Springfield）(2)完成的。其中一部分是在林肯家的客厅完成的，他在那儿度过了郁郁寡欢的十六个年头。还有一部分是在林肯草拟就职演说的桌子上完成的，剩余部分则是在他参加庭审以及和玛丽·托德吵架的地方完成的。

当哈洛兹堡还叫作哈罗德堡的时候，那里住着一位名叫安·麦金蒂（Ann McGinty）的女士。据史料记载，安和她的丈夫是第一批将猪、鸭和纺车引进肯塔基的人。此外，安·麦金蒂也是这片黑暗血腥的蛮荒之地上第一个做出黄油的人。然而，她真正出名的，是在当地织出了一个经济奇迹。在那片神秘的印第安土地上，不产棉花，也买不到棉花，绵羊又总是遭到大灰狼的猎杀，因此几乎没有能织成布的东西。然而独具匠心的安·麦金蒂却巧妙地利用当地两种常见又便宜的材料——荨麻絮和水牛毛，织成了一种布，人称“麦金蒂布”。

这项伟大的发明吸引了众多的家庭主妇。她们不惜跋涉一百五十英里，只为挤在麦金蒂的小屋里跟她学习这门新手艺。主妇们一边纺织，一边聊天。渐渐地，除了谈论荨麻絮和水牛毛，她们也聊起了各种流言蜚语。很快，安·麦金蒂的小屋便成了当地公认的绯闻交流中心。

在那个年代，通奸是一项可被起诉的罪行，非婚生子是一种非法行为。对于麦金蒂来说，没什么比向起诉陪审团(1)揭露那些本已饱受折磨的姑娘的罪行更能深切地滋润她那干枯的灵魂了。在哈罗德堡季审法庭的记录里，总是反复出现某些可怜姑娘因“安·麦金蒂提供的消息”而被起诉通奸罪的故事。一七八三年春天，哈罗德堡一共审判了十七宗案子，而通奸案就占了八例。

一七八九年十一月二十四日，起诉陪审团写了这样一份诉状：

“露西·汉克斯（Lucy Hanks）犯有通奸罪。”

这不是露西第一次被告上法庭。多年前在弗吉尼亚，她就有过类似的经历。

因年代久远，当时那件事并未留下很多记录。而仅存的记录也只是苍白地陈述事实，没有提到事件的背景和细节。但综合其他渠道信息，也大致能还原出故事的梗概来，因为事件的基本要素都已具备。

汉克斯家族住在弗吉尼亚州的拉帕汉诺克河和波托马克河之间的狭长地带。在那片土地上，还住着华盛顿家族、李氏家族、卡特家族和方特勒罗伊家族等一些名门望族。这些贵族都去基督教堂做礼拜。像汉克斯那样穷困又不识字的平民百姓，也和贵族们一起去教堂做礼拜。

一七八一年十一月的第二个周日，露西·汉克斯和往常一样去教堂做礼拜。那天，华盛顿将军带着拉斐特将军(2)（General La Fayette）一起去了教堂。这可是一件引发万人空巷的大事，人人都想一睹这位法国将军的风采——就在一个月前，这位了不起的将军帮助华盛顿在约克镇俘获了康沃利斯勋爵（Lord Cornwallis）的军队。

那天早上，唱完了最后一首赞美诗，说完了最后一句祝祷词后，教区的居民们便排起了长队，激动地与两位沙场英雄握手。




除了军事战略和国家大事，拉斐特将军还有一个嗜好：对漂亮的年轻女子特别感兴趣。每当有人向他引见漂亮姑娘，而他又恰好中意时，便会献上赞美之吻——这已成了他的习惯。那天早上，在基督教堂门口，他亲吻了七位姑娘。他的这一行为引起了人们极大的热议，人们对此的关注远甚于对教区牧师用洪亮的声音诵读的《路加福音》第三章的热情。露西·汉克斯便是他所亲吻的七位幸运女孩之一。

这个吻引发了一连串的事件。这些事件对美国未来的影响，与拉斐特将军为我们浴血奋战的所有战争的总和相比，有过之而无不及。

那天早晨，人群中站着一位富有的贵族单身汉。长久以来，他对汉克斯家族只有一些模糊的认识，知道他们目不识丁，知道他们很穷，也知道他们来自那个与自己有着天壤之别的世界。但是那天早晨，他觉得——当然，这完全可能只是他的臆想——拉斐特将军给露西的吻似乎比给其他姑娘的吻多了几分热情。

这位种植园主打心眼里尊敬拉斐特将军的军事才能和欣赏美丽女子的眼光。因此，这位单身汉开始惦记露西·汉克斯了。当他想着露西时，他想到了几位举世闻名的美人。她们都是在和露西一样贫穷的环境下长大的，有的出身甚至还比不上露西。例如汉密尔顿夫人。例如杜巴瑞夫人——一位穷得叮当响的裁缝的私生女。杜巴瑞夫人本身是不识字的，却通过路易十五统治了整个法兰西。想到这些先例，这位种植园主便感到欣慰，他心中的欲火也因此被美化了。

当天是周日。第二天，也就是周一的时候，种植园主一整天都在考虑露西的事。到了周二早上，他迫不及待地策马奔向汉克斯一家住着的脏兮兮的小屋，雇用露西到他种植园里的农舍做女仆。

他已经有了一大堆奴隶，根本不需要再多一个女仆。可是他却雇用了露西，而且只委派她一些轻活儿，也不要求她和其他奴隶一起做事。

当时弗吉尼亚的富人家庭都习惯将儿子送到英国读书。露西的雇主曾在牛津大学读书，并把很多自己的藏书带回了美国。一天，他走进家里的书房，看到露西坐在那里，手里拿着抹布，低头凝视着一本历史书上的插图。

这对女仆来说是一件逾越本分的事，但他非但没有责备露西，反而关上了书房的门，坐在她身边，为她阅读图片下方的文字说明，并向她解释其中的意思。

她兴趣盎然地听着，然后坦诚地表示自己想要读书写字。这让他大吃一惊。

一个女仆竟然想要读书写字！可是这有什么好惊讶的？现在的我们很难理解，但那可是一七八一年。当时的弗吉尼亚没有免费的学校，能在契约上签下自己名字的有产者不到州人口的一半，所有的妇女都不识字，转卖土地时只能在协议上画个记号。

然而，现在却有一个女仆想要读书写字。即便是弗吉尼亚最好的公民，即便不说她反了天了，也会认为这是一件危险的事。但是她的雇主却对这个想法颇感兴趣，并愿意亲自教她。那天晚上，晚餐过后，他把她叫去了书房，开始教她字母表。又过了几晚，他握着她那抓着鹅毛笔的手，手把手地教她如何写字。就这样，他们之间的教学关系存续了很长一段时间。值得一提的是，他教得棒极了。露西当年的字条有一张保留了下来，上面的花体字大胆而自信。她的字迹中有一股精神，也很能体现个性。她不仅用对了“批准”这个词，而且拼写也正确。这在当时可不是一份小成就，因为就算是华盛顿那样的伟人，也未必总能把字拼对。

每晚的读写课结束后，露西便和她的雇主并肩坐在书房里，一起看炉火中跳跃的火焰和缓缓地在森林与夜空交界处升起的明月。

露西爱上了他，并且十分信任他。但她的信任太过了。这种爱与信任在她的体内蔓延，弄得她一连几个星期都焦躁不安。她食不下咽，夜不能寐，脸上总是挂着憔悴的神情。当她再也无法否认自己的情感时，她告诉了他。有一个瞬间，他想过娶她。但也只是一瞬间。家庭、朋友、社会地位、错综复杂的状况、令人不悦的场景……不行。而且，他也开始厌倦露西了。因此，他给了露西一笔钱，打发她离开了。

几个月过去了，人们一直对露西指指点点，还刻意避开她。

接着，在一个周日早晨，露西毫不羞耻地带着自己的孩子去了教堂。这引起了一场轰动。那些自命贤良的妇人愤怒极了，有人在教堂里站起来，厉声喊道：“将这个荡妇赶出去！”

这一切真是够了。露西的父亲不愿女儿再受屈辱，于是汉克斯一家将他们那仅有的几件家当装上了一辆马车，踏上荒野之路(3)，穿过坎伯兰岬口，最后定居在肯塔基州的哈罗德堡。在那里，没有人认识他们，因此关于露西孩子的父亲，他们也有了更好的说辞。

但是在哈罗德堡，露西的美貌和魅力对于男人来说，仍和在弗吉尼亚时一样充满吸引力。男人们追求她，和她调情，于是她再次坠入爱河。这一次，露西很快就成了失足的荡妇。有人发现了她的情事，然后告诉了别人，最后传到了安·麦金蒂那里。于是，正如前文所说的那样，起诉陪审团指控露西犯有通奸罪。但是法官知道露西不是那种应受法律制裁的女人，因此他把传票塞进了口袋，不去管她，自己猎鹿去了。

那是十一月的事。到了来年三月，陪审团的成员们又聚集在了一起。这一次，一位妇女带来了关于露西的更为恶毒的谣言和绯闻，并要求法庭强制露西出庭面对自己犯下的罪行。于是，第二张传票送到了露西家门口。露西气坏了，将传票撕成了碎片，扔在了送传票的人脸上。到了五月，法院会再次传唤露西。当时，如果那位年轻而杰出的先生没有出现，露西肯定会被强制出庭。

他的名字叫亨利·斯帕罗（Henry Sparrow）。他骑着马来到镇上，将马系在露西的小屋前，然后走了进去。

“露西，”他也许是这样说的，“我根本不在乎那些女人怎么说你。我爱你，我希望你能成为我的妻子。”这或许不是他的原话，但至少他是向露西求过婚的。

但露西并不想立刻结婚。她不希望镇上再传出谣言，说斯帕罗是被迫和她结婚的。

“亨利，我们再等一年。”她坚持道，“在这段时间里，我会向人们证明我有能力过体面的生活。如果一年后你还想娶我，那就来找我，我会等着你。”

一七九〇年四月二十六日，亨利·斯帕罗取得了结婚证书，自此，再也没听说传票的事了。大约一年后，他们结婚了。

于是，安·麦金蒂那群长舌妇又开始嚼舌根了。她们并不看好这段婚姻，总说：这段婚姻长不了，露西这种不守妇道的娼妇，早晚都会重操旧业。亨利·斯帕罗听到了这些谣言，其他人也都听到了这些谣言。为了保护露西，亨利建议他们搬去更遥远的西部，找一处比这里和谐的环境，开始新的生活。但是露西拒绝了这种惯常的逃避方式。她说，她不是坏女人。她这么说的时候，倔强地昂着头。她不会再逃跑了。她决定在哈罗德堡定居，与那里的人们斗争到底。

露西做到了。她养育了八个孩子，在当地恢复了名誉——她的名字不再和下流的笑话捆绑在一起。

最后，她的两个儿子成了牧师；她的一个外孙——也就是那个私生女的儿子——成了美国总统。他的名字叫亚伯拉罕·林肯。




这就是林肯较近的祖先的故事。林肯自己很重视弗吉尼亚那位受过良好教育的外公。

威廉·H.赫恩登（William H. Herndon）是林肯律师事务所的合伙人，两人共事二十一载。威廉大概是世上最了解林肯的人。幸运的是，他写了一部三卷篇幅的林肯传，并在一八八八年出版。这是众多与林肯有关的作品中最为重要的一部。我现在把第一卷第三页和第四页的内容引述如下：

对于林肯的血统和出身，我只记得他曾提过一次。那是在一八五〇年，我和他驾着他那辆单骑小马车，朝着伊利诺伊州默纳德县的地方法庭驶去。当时我们要审理的案件，很可能直接或间接地涉及遗传性状。在途中，我第一次听他提起了自己的母亲。他详细地告诉了我他母亲的特点，列举了自己从她身上遗传到的性格品质。除此之外，他还告诉我他的母亲是露西·汉克斯和弗吉尼亚一位受过良好教育的种植园主的私生女。他认为自己之所以和汉克斯家族的其他后辈不一样，是因为他具有卓越的分析能力、逻辑能力、思维活动和雄心壮志。而这些品质，都来源于那位种植园主。在谈到遗传性状时他认为，虽然现在还不能证明其中的原因，但是非婚生子女要比婚生子女更健壮、更聪明。就他自己而言，他相信自己超越常人的美好本性和卓越品质都是遗传自那位豁达的弗吉尼亚无名氏。这些痛苦的往事勾起了他对母亲的思念。马车颠簸着向前驶去，他悲伤地说：“愿上帝保佑我的母亲。我现在有的一切，以及将来也许会拥有的成就，都是我母亲的功劳。”说完这句话，他立刻陷入了沉默。我们之间的交谈也戛然而止。一路上，我们很久都没有再说一个字。他深深地陷入了悲伤。毫无疑问，他仍沉浸在刚才提起的往事中。他给自己筑了一圈屏障，我不敢越界半步。他说过的话和言语中流露出的悲伤给我留下了极深刻的印象。这是我永远无法忘记的一次经历。





2


林肯的母亲，南希·汉克斯（Nancy Hanks），是由叔叔和婶婶抚养长大的。她很可能一天学也没上过。从她签协议时画的记号看，我们推测她不会写字。

她住在昏暗的树林深处，几乎没什么朋友。二十二岁时，她嫁给了肯塔基州最没文化最卑微的穷鬼——托马斯（汤姆）·林肯（Thomas Lincoln）。托马斯是一个无聊透顶又愚昧无知的男人，靠打短工和猎鹿为生。虽然他姓林肯，但边远蛮荒林区和藤丛聚居地的人们都叫他“林哄”。

托马斯·林肯是一个流浪汉，四处漂泊，什么事都做不好。他从一个地方漂泊到另一个地方，为了填饱肚子，什么活儿都干。他曾修过路，砍过树，捕过熊，垦过荒地，种过玉米，造过木屋。据资料记载，他曾三次在不同场合受雇持霰弹枪看守犯人。一八〇五年，肯塔基州的哈丁县还以每小时六美分的价格雇他抓捕并鞭打敢于反抗的奴隶。

他一点儿存钱理财的观念都没有。他在印第安纳州的一个农场住了十四年，在这期间，他一年竟然连十美元土地费都存不下来。他一度贫困到要让妻子用野生荆棘来缝补衣服的地步，但就是在这种情况下，他还能去肯塔基州的伊丽莎白镇为自己赊账买一条丝质吊带裤。没过多久，他又在一场拍卖会上花三美元买了一把宝剑。他很可能是穿着丝质吊带裤，佩带着宝剑，光着脚走回去的。

婚后不久，他搬到了镇上，尝试着靠做木工为生。他得到了一份建造磨坊的工作，但是他没把木材切方正，也弄错了木材的长度。雇主当然不愿意为这种笨拙的手艺付钱，他还为此打了三场官司。

汤姆·林肯来自森林，他虽然笨，但最终也明白了自己只属于森林。于是他带着妻子搬回了森林边缘那块贫瘠多石的农场，从此再也没有莽撞地为了乡村生活抛弃脚下的土地。

离伊丽莎白镇不远处有一片广阔的不长树木的土地，人称“贫瘠之地”。印第安人世代在那里放火焚烧森林和灌木丛，劣等牧草因此能在阳光下滋长，水牛群也能在此吃草和打滚。

一八〇八年十二月，汤姆·林肯以每公顷六十六又三分之二美分的价格在这片“贫瘠之地”买了一块农场。农场上有一间猎人休息的茅草屋，建造粗糙，周围满是野生的红果树。茅草屋一英里外流淌着诺林溪的南支，每到春天，那里的山茱萸总是绚烂地盛开着。夏天的时候，鹰群懒洋洋地盘旋在头顶蓝色的天空中，高高的草儿在风中摇曳，看上去就像一片无尽的绿色海洋。这里鲜有人居住，因为几乎没有人像汤姆·林肯那样缺乏判断力。因此，到了冬天，这里便成了整个肯塔基州最孤寂荒芜的地方。

一八〇九年的严冬，正是在那片孤寂的贫瘠之地边缘的那座猎人的小屋里，亚伯拉罕·林肯来到了这个世上。那是一个星期天的早晨，他出生在一张圆木搭成的、铺满了玉米壳的床上。外面狂风大作，二月的寒风将雪花顺着圆木间的缝隙吹到了南希·汉克斯和她刚出生的孩子盖着的熊皮上。九年后，她没能扛住拓荒生活的重压和艰辛，最终积劳成疾去世了，享年三十五岁。她一辈子都不知道什么是幸福。她无论去哪里，都会因私生女的身份而饱受流言蜚语的侵扰。只可惜那天早晨，她不能预见未来，不能看到若干年后，就在她当时千辛万苦生下亚伯拉罕·林肯的地方，心怀感恩的人们为她的儿子建了一座大理石纪念堂。

在那个时代的荒野中，纸币好像没有多大价值。大多数时候，纸币一文不值。人们常用猪、鹿肉火腿、威士忌、浣熊皮、棕熊皮还有农产品作为媒介进行交换。就连牧师有时也收取威士忌作为其部分服务费。一八一六年秋天，亚伯拉罕七岁了，老汤姆·林肯将他在肯塔基州的农场换了四百加仑玉米威士忌，然后举家迁往印第安纳州幽暗清冷、荒凉孤寂的树林中。他们最近的邻居是一位捕熊的猎户；他们住处的四周长满了树木、矮树丛、葡萄藤和灌木丛。若是有人想穿过这一层层厚厚的屏障，必须连劈带砍弄出条路来才行。这里便是丹尼斯·汉克斯（Dennis Hanks）(4)称之为“密林礼赞”的地方，也是亚伯拉罕·林肯往后十四年所居住的地方。

当林肯一家搬到那里时，第一场冬雪早已飘然落下，于是汤姆·林肯慌忙建起了一座“三面墙之家”——用今天的标准看，至多只能称其为遮风棚。屋子没有地板，没有门，没有窗户，除了三个墙面和一个用圆木和树枝搭建的屋顶，其他什么都没有。屋子的第四面是敞开的，寒风、雪花、冻雨和刺骨的寒冷凛冽地灌入屋内。如今，即便是现代化的印第安纳州农民也不会让自己的牛和猪在如此粗糙的棚屋里过冬，但是汤姆·林肯觉得这样的条件对于他和他的家人来说，已经够好了。汤姆一家在那里度过了一八一六年至一八一七年的漫漫严冬——美国历史上最为严酷的冬天之一。

屋角肮脏的地上堆放着一堆树叶和熊皮，在这样的寒冬里，南希·汉克斯和她的孩子像狗一样蜷缩在上面。

至于食物，他们没有黄油，没有牛奶，没有鸡蛋，没有水果，没有蔬菜，甚至连土豆都没有。他们主要依靠野味和坚果为生。

汤姆·林肯也曾试着养猪，但森林里的棕熊都饿坏了，猪一旦落入它们手中，就会被生吞活剥。

亚伯拉罕·林肯在印第安纳州那些年所受的苦，远比日后他所解放的成千上万个奴隶受的苦多得多。

在那片土地上，人们几乎不知道还有牙医这个行当，而最近的医生也在三十五英里之外。因此，当南希·林肯牙疼时，老汤姆很可能和其他拓荒者一样，用山胡桃木削一个楔子，楔子一端顶住南希犯病的臼齿，然后用石头狠狠地向楔子砸去。最早的那几年，中西部地区的拓荒者们饱受“牛乳病”的折磨。这种神秘的疾病对牛羊马这些牲畜来说非常致命，一旦染上便无力回天。有时，牛乳病甚至会夺走一个地区所有居民的性命。没有人知道它的病因是什么，一百年来医学专家亦一直为之烦恼。直到二十世纪初，科学家才发现，牛乳病是由于动物误食一种名为白蛇根的有毒植物而引起的，其毒素经由牛奶进入人体。白蛇根主要生长在树木繁茂的牧场和荫蔽的深谷，直到今日，仍有人命丧它手。每年伊利诺伊州农业部都会在郡法院门口贴上海报，警告农民除掉这种植物，否则他们可能会因此而死。

一八一八年秋天，这致命的祸害来到了印第安纳鹿角山谷，残忍地摧毁了很多家庭。南希·林肯帮忙照顾皮特·布鲁纳（Peter Brooner）患病的妻子。皮特就是那位住在半英里之外的猎熊人邻居。布鲁纳太太去世了，南希突然患上了病。她感到头晕，下腹部传来剧痛，呕吐得很厉害。她被抬回家，躺在那张简陋的铺满了树叶和兽皮的床铺上。她手脚冰凉，内脏却似着了火，她不断地要水喝。水，水，更多的水。

汤姆·林肯是一个坚信凡事皆有预兆的人。因此，在南希患病的第二天晚上，当他听到破旧的小屋外面传来悠长又凄惨的狗吠时，他便放弃了所有希望，断定南希大限将至。

后来，南希虚弱到连从枕头上抬头的力气都没有了。她只能发出耳语般微弱的声音，示意亚伯拉罕和他的姐姐走到她的身边。孩子们弯下腰，耳朵贴在她的唇边，听到了她拼尽全力说出的话：她恳求他们互相关爱，像她教诲的那样生活，并且敬拜上帝。

由于她的喉咙和肠道已经处于一级瘫痪状态，这些话便是她最后的遗言。随后，她陷入了长时间的昏迷，最终在一八一八年十月五日，也就是生病的第七天撒手人寰。

为了让死者瞑目，汤姆·林肯在南希的眼皮上压了两枚铜币，然后便走进森林，伐了一棵树，将它切割成一块块粗糙不平的木板，再用木钉将这些木板钉在一起。露西·汉克斯那面容愁苦的女儿最终成了一具久经操劳又饱受折磨的躯体，静静地躺在这具粗糙的棺材里。

两年前，汤姆用一辆雪橇将她拉进了这片聚居地，现在，他也是用一辆雪橇，将她的尸体拉向四分之一英里外一座树木繁茂的山顶，就地埋葬了她，没有祈祷，也没有仪式。

亚伯拉罕·林肯的母亲死得太早了。我们也许永远也无法知道她长什么样子，是个什么样的女人，因为她的一生都住在阴暗的树林里，而那几个和她生命有交集的人，也只对她有些模糊的印象。

林肯死后没过多久，他的一位传记作者开始着手寻找关于总统母亲的讯息。当时，南希已去世半个世纪了。那位作者采访了几位曾经见过她的人，但他们的记忆就像逝去的梦一样模糊。甚至对于她的外形，他们也无法统一。一个人说她是一个“强壮的，矮胖的女人”，但另一个人却说她“身材瘦削柔弱”。有人说她有一双黑色的眼睛，另外一个人却说她的眼睛是淡褐色的，还有人很肯定地说她的眼睛是蓝绿色的。她的堂兄丹尼斯·汉克斯曾和她在同一屋檐下共同生活了十四年，他写道，她拥有一头“浅色的头发”。但进一步回忆后，他驳回了自己的描述，说她的头发是黑色的。

她去世后的六十年间，她的长眠之地连一块标志性的石块都没有，因此如今我们只能知道她的坟墓的大概位置。她长眠在抚养她的叔叔和婶婶的坟墓边上，但没人知道三座坟墓中，哪一座是她的。

南希死前不久，汤姆·林肯盖了一座新的木屋。这次终于有四面墙了，但仍旧没有地板，没有窗户，没有门。入口处挂着一块肮脏的熊皮，屋内又黑又脏。汤姆·林肯大多数时间在树林里打猎，留下两个没有母亲的孩子照料家里的一切。萨拉负责煮饭，亚伯拉罕负责生火，并去一英里外的泉眼取水。他们没有刀和叉子，只能用手抓着吃。他们的手常年都很脏，因为水很珍贵，而且他们也没有肥皂。南希很可能自制了一些碱水肥皂，但她死后留下的那些早就用光了。孩子们并不知道肥皂的制作方法，而汤姆·林肯也不愿意做肥皂，于是他们就继续生活在贫穷和肮脏之中。

在那漫长又寒冷的冬日，他们根本不洗澡，极偶尔地洗一洗他们那满是泥土、褴褛不堪的外衣。他们那铺满叶子和兽皮的床变得越来越脏。他们的屋子终日得不到阳光的照拂。小屋唯一的光源来自炉火或猪油灯。从详细描述边远地区其他小屋情况的文字中我们可以想象，没有女主人的林肯家是怎样的景象：臭气熏天，跳蚤到处跑，满地都是寄生虫。

这样肮脏的生活持续了一年后，即便是汤姆，也无法再忍受下去了。于是，他决定再娶一个老婆，负责照料家务。

十三年前，汤姆曾在肯塔基州向一位名叫萨拉·布什（Sarah Bush）的女子求婚。她拒绝了汤姆，嫁给了哈丁县的一位狱卒。不过后来狱卒死了，留下了三个孩子和一些债务。汤姆·林肯认为这是重新求婚的吉兆，于是他来到溪边，好好洗了个澡，用沙子擦掉脸上和手上的污渍，将剑佩在腰间，穿过阴暗的森林深处，回到了肯塔基州。

当他到达伊丽莎白镇的时候，他又买了一条丝质吊带裤，并沿着街道吹着口哨大摇大摆地走着。

那是一八一九年，变革正在发生，人们到处谈论着社会进步。那时，一艘蒸汽船横跨了大西洋。

林肯十五岁的时候才开始认识字母表，虽然能进行一些阅读，但仍困难重重，写字就更无从谈起了。一八二四年的秋天，一位边远地区的流浪教师漂泊到了鸽子溪的拓荒居民区，建了一所学校。于是，林肯和他的姐姐每天起早贪黑，步行四英里穿过树林，来向这位新来的老师学习。阿策尔·多西（Azel Dorsey）老师喜欢听到琅琅读书声，总是要求孩子们大声地朗读。这样一来，他便知道他们是否用功。他总是拿着教鞭在教室里走来走去，看到沉默的学生便会给上一鞭子。不大声朗读便会受罚，于是，孩子们都扯开了嗓门，努力比别人读得更加响亮。他们的叫嚷声很远都听得见。

上学的时候，林肯总是戴一顶松鼠皮小帽，穿着一条鹿皮短裤。鹿皮裤的裤腿离鞋面总有几英寸的距离，因此林肯那瘦削又发青的小腿只能裸露在风雪中。

学校的教室是一座简陋的小屋，屋顶很矮，勉强够老师直起腰。小屋没有窗户，四边墙上各抽去了一根圆木，开口的地方糊上油纸，好让光线透进来。地板和桌椅是由劈开的圆木做成的。

阅读课上，林肯阅读《圣经》中的章节。练习写作时，林肯总是模仿华盛顿和杰斐逊，因此，他的字迹和他们很像，非常清晰，很容易辨认。人们夸奖林肯的字迹，那些不识字的邻居也都不惜步行数英里找林肯为他们写信。

林肯在学习生活中找到了真正的兴趣和热情。在学校的那几个小时实在是太短暂了，于是他回家后继续学习。纸张既少又贵，他便拿一根炭棒，在木板上写字。小屋的四面墙壁是由劈开的圆木筑成的，他便在圆木平坦的那一面上做算术。当四面墙壁全部写满了数字和字母时，他便用一把刻刀，刮掉有字的表面，然后继续算题写字。

他买不起算术书，便借了一本，将书上的内容抄在一张张普通信笺大小的纸上，再用麻绳将纸片穿起来。这样，他便有了一本自制的算术书。直到他去世，他的继母仍旧保留着这本书的部分书页。

从那时起，他开始展露出了一种明显优于其他边远地区学生的禀赋。他渴望将自己对许多话题的意见写下来，有时甚至还写成了诗句。他将自己的诗句和散文拿给邻居威廉·伍德（William Wood）评判。伍德却把他的诗句都背了下来，而他的文章也得到了关注。一位律师非常欣赏他写国家政策的文章，甚至把文章寄出去发表。俄亥俄州的一家报纸也刊登了他一篇关于戒酒的文章。

当然，这都是后话。他在学校写的第一篇文章的灵感来自玩伴们常玩的一种残忍游戏——抓来水龟，然后将燃烧的炭块放在水龟背上。林肯恳求他们住手，并跑过去赤脚踢掉了滚烫的炭块。他的第一篇文章，便是恳求人们不要再虐待动物。那时的林肯还只是个孩子，但却展现出了对饱受苦难的生命深深的同情。多年以后，这种慈悲心成了他独特的品质。

五年后，林肯又去了另一所学校断断续续地学了一段时间，用他自己的话说，“时去时不去”。

这便是林肯所接受的全部正规教育，上学时间加在一起不超过十二个月。

一八四七年，林肯去了国会。他填写履历表时，当被问到“受教育程度”时，他只说了一个词：不全。

他被提名为总统候选人后，他说：“我成年时，很多事都不懂，但我会阅读，会写作，还能做三位数的算术。不过也只是到这个程度而已。从此以后，我没有再去过学校。在这些教育基础上，我现在所取得的这点进步，全是受现实所迫一点一点自学起来的。”

至于那些曾经教过林肯的老师，大多是四处漂泊、赶路到天黑的流浪教师。他们相信巫术，相信地球是平的。但是，在那段破碎的、毫无规律的求学生涯中，林肯拥有了一种人类最重要的品质：对知识的热爱和对学习的渴求。而大学教育的目的，也不过如此。

阅读为林肯打开了一个全新的充满魔力的世界，一个他从未想过的世界。阅读改变了他，拓宽了他的视野。在之后的二十五年里，阅读仍然是他的热情所在。他的继母给他们带来了五本书：《圣经》、《伊索寓言》、《鲁滨孙漂流记》、《天路历程》和《水手辛巴达》。林肯全神贯注地阅读着这些无价之宝。他将《圣经》和《伊索寓言》放在伸手就能拿到的地方，一有空便开始阅读。这两本书深深地影响了他的风格、说话方式以及辩论方法。

但这些书远远不够。他渴望阅读更多的东西，但他没有钱，于是只能四处借书，借报纸，借任何可以阅读的印刷品。他曾沿着俄亥俄河一直走，只为向一位律师借一本修订版的《印第安纳州法典》。于是，他第一次读到了《独立宣言》和《美国宪法》。

他向邻家的农户借了几本传记，为此他经常帮这位邻居挖树桩、锄玉米。在那几本传记中，帕森·威姆斯（Parson Weems）的《华盛顿传》深深地吸引了年轻的林肯。他常常在夜里捧着这本书，直至天黑得再也看不见一个字为止。睡觉的时候，他将这本书卡在圆木墙的缝隙里，如此一来，等到了第二天清晨，当第一缕阳光透进小屋的时候，他便能立即开始阅读。一天晚上，暴风雨席卷而至，夹在墙缝里的书被打湿了。书的主人要林肯买下这本书，林肯为此不得不替邻居做了三天活，帮他收割饲料，并将它们扎成禾束。

在他借过的所有书中，令他收获最大的莫过于《斯考特教程》。这本书在公众演讲方面给了林肯很多指导。通过这本书，林肯接触到了西塞罗、狄摩西尼斯以及莎士比亚笔下众多人物的著名演讲。

他总是一边拿着《斯考特教程》一边在树下来回踱步，慷慨激昂地朗诵着哈姆雷特的台词，或者一遍遍地重复着安东尼在恺撒遗体旁的演说：“朋友们，罗马公民们，乡亲们，请听我说！我是来埋葬恺撒，而不是赞美他的。”

当他遇到引起深深共鸣的段落时，便会抄写下来，若手边没有纸，他便用粉笔将句子写在木板上。后来，他有了一本自己的便写本。他用秃鹰的羽毛蘸上商陆汁，在便写本上摘录下自己最喜欢的段落。他总是随身携带着这本宝贝，一有空就拿出来学习，直至将所有的长诗和演讲都熟记于心。

他去田里干活的时候，也带着他的便写本。马儿在玉米地的一端休息，他便坐在围栏上学习。正午的时候，他并不坐下来和家人一起吃饭，而是一手拿着玉米饼，一手拿着便写本，把腿搁得比自己的脑袋还高，然后完全沉浸在字里行间。

法院开庭的时候，林肯便步行十五英里前往河边的小镇，旁听律师们辩护。随后，当他和其他人一起在地里干活时，他总是时不时放下手中的锄头或草叉，爬上围栏，重复地演说着在罗克波特或者布恩维尔听到的律师们的对白。在其他时候，他则会模仿浸信会牧师的布道——周日的时候，总能在小鸽子溪教堂里听到那些顽固的牧师滔滔不绝地大声宣讲。

亚伯常把《奎恩笑话集》带到田间。每当他骑坐在圆木上大声朗读书中的故事时，树林中总是回荡着他的众多听众发出的阵阵笑声。但与此同时，玉米地里渐渐长满了野草，田间的小麦也发黄了。

雇用林肯的农民们抱怨林肯太懒了，他对此供认不讳。“我是太懒了。我父亲教会我怎么干活儿，却没有教会我热爱干活儿。”他说。

终于，老林肯发话了：决不允许再这么胡闹。然而，事情并未有任何改变，亚伯仍旧在田间读笑话做演讲。有一天，老林肯当着众人的面狠狠地扇了林肯一个耳光，并将他打得倒在了地上。林肯哭了，但什么都没说。此时此刻，父子间的关系已然渐渐疏离，而这份疏离也成了他们余生的相处方式。虽然林肯在父亲晚年时给予了他金钱上的帮助，但一八五一年老林肯去世时，林肯并未去看望他。林肯说：“如果我们现在见面，不见得欢喜会比痛苦多。”

一八三〇年的冬天，牛乳病再度来袭，死亡的阴影在印第安纳州的鹿角山谷再次蔓延开来。

面对重新席卷而来的牛乳病，惯于漂泊的汤姆·林肯既害怕又沮丧，于是他卖掉了猪和玉米，又以八十美元卖掉了自己那满是树桩和害虫的农场，置办了一辆笨重的牛车——这可是他的第一辆牛车。他把家具装在牛车里，将鞭子交到亚伯手中，冲着拉车的牛大吼了一声，带着家人朝伊利诺伊州的桑加蒙河谷驶去。据印第安人说，那里遍地都是粮食。

老牛拉着沉重的牛车，蹒跚地向前走着。牛车吱吱呀呀地翻过山丘，穿过印第安纳州的森林，越过伊利诺伊州荒无人烟的大草原。草原上阳光温暖，满地都是萎黄的枯草，足足有六英尺高。

在文森斯（Vincennes），林肯第一次见到了印刷机。那时他已二十一岁。

在迪凯特（Decatur），他们在法院旁的广场上露营。二十六年后，林肯准确地指出了当时牛车停放的地方。

“我当时不知道，我拥有成为律师的足够的判断力。”他说。

赫恩登在书里写道：

林肯先生曾向我描述过那次旅行。他说，大地还未从霜冻中苏醒过来，白天地面的霜会融化，但到了晚上又会重新结冰，因此旅行，尤其是驾着牛车的旅行，变得格外的冗长和疲惫。路上遇到没有桥可通过的河流时，除非能找到绕行的路线，否则一大家子就得涉水而过。而即便是那些绕行的道路，早上的时候也结上了薄薄的一层冰。牛每走一步，便能踩碎一平方码的薄冰。除了家什，他们还带了一只宠物狗，让它跟在牛车后面跑。一天，他们刚渡过一条小河，却发现小家伙不见了。他们朝对岸看去，只见小狗在对岸哀号着，着急得直蹦。河里到处都是破碎的冰块，可怜的小家伙根本不敢过河。如果要去救小狗，就得让牛车掉头，然后再过一趟河，但他们经不起这样的折腾。因此，急着前行的一大家子决定抛弃小狗，继续往前走。“一想到要抛弃它，我就受不了。”林肯说，“于是我脱下鞋袜，蹚过小河，一把抱起瑟瑟发抖的小东西，将它夹在腋下，顺利地回到了对岸。它非常感激我，狂喜地蹦跳着，做了各种狗表示感谢的动作。这种回报远远超出了我吃的苦头。”

当老牛拉着林肯一家越过大草原时，国会里弥漫着一股深沉而不祥的情绪——议员们正激烈地辩论着各州是否有权限脱离联邦。在辩论中，参议员丹尼尔·韦伯斯特（Daniel Webster）用其如洪钟般深沉又铿锵的嗓音发表了演说。这就是著名的“韦伯斯特给海恩（Hayne）的答复”，林肯认为它是“美国演讲最伟大的范本”。而韦伯斯特在演讲最后说的那几句让人无法忘怀的话语也成了林肯的参政信条：“自由和联邦，无论从前还是将来，都是一个整体，不可分割！”

这场飓风般的辩论所涉及的问题，直到三十年后才得到解决。而解决它的不是伟大的韦伯斯特，不是天赋极高的克莱（Clay），也不是著名的卡尔霍恩（Calhoun），而是一个笨拙的、身无分文的、前途不明的驾驶着牛车朝伊利诺伊州驶去的车夫。这位车夫戴着一顶浣熊皮帽子，穿着鹿皮裤子，快乐地哼着小曲：

嗨，哥伦比亚，快乐的土地！

如果大家没喝痛快，那我可就该死了。

林肯一家在伊利诺伊州的迪凯特城附近的一片林地定居了下来。林地的旁边是一处悬崖，悬崖下面便是桑加蒙河。

亚伯干了很多活儿：砍树，造房子，砍倒灌木丛，清理土地，赶着一头上了轭的公牛耕十五英亩土地，种玉米，以及劈开树桩修建围栏以便保护地里的财产。

第二年，邻居们雇林肯做了很多稀奇古怪的活儿，例如犁地、打场、劈木条以及杀猪。

亚伯·林肯在伊利诺伊州的第一个冬天，是该州历史上最寒冷的一个冬天。草原上的积雪足有十五英尺深，牛都冻死了，野鹿和野火鸡也几乎绝迹了，甚至还有人被冻死了。

在那个冬天，为了换一条用白胡桃木树皮染制的棕色牛仔布做的裤子，林肯不得不劈上一千根木条。为了去工作，每天他都要越过三英里的路。有一次，在渡过桑加蒙河时，独木舟翻了，他掉进了满是冰块的河水中。当他奋力地游到离他最近的瓦尼克少校（Major Warnick）家时，他的双脚已冻伤。之后整整一个月，他都无法走路，只能躺在瓦尼克少校家壁炉前的地板上，讲些有趣的故事，并阅读了一卷《伊利诺伊州法典》。

在这之前，林肯曾追求过少校的女儿，但少校对此并不赞同。搞什么鬼？我瓦尼克家的女儿怎么会嫁给这个既笨拙又没受过教育的、只会劈木条的年轻人？而且还是一个没有土地，没有现金，也没有前途的穷鬼！门儿都没有！

确实，林肯并没有土地，更糟糕的是，他根本不想拥有土地。他在农田里生活了二十二年，拓荒经验已十分丰富，但他讨厌乏味磨人的农务，讨厌这种单调的生活。他渴望出人头地，渴望和外面的世界接触，他希望找一份能认识各种各样的人的工作，他希望能有一群人围在他身边，因为他的故事而放声大笑。

在印第安纳的时候，亚伯曾替人划着平底船顺河而下去新奥尔良。这份工作让林肯非常开心。一路上真是新鲜极了，充满了刺激和冒险。有一天晚上，当他们的船停靠在杜谢恩夫人（Madame Duchesne）的种植园旁时，一群手持刀和棍棒的黑人闯入了船内，试图杀掉船员，将尸体抛入河中，然后带着整船的货物顺流而下去新奥尔良的贼窝。

林肯随手抄起一根棍子，凭借着有力而颀长的双臂，一下子将三个强盗打翻到河中，接着又将其他人赶回了岸上。但是在战斗中，一个黑人用刀砍伤了林肯的前额，在他右眼靠上的位置留下了一道口子。从此以后，这道伤疤跟随了林肯一辈子。

就连汤姆·林肯也无法说服儿子做一个垦荒的农民。

见过了新奥尔良后，亚伯又找了一份河上的工作。他和继母的儿子以及表兄一起砍树，劈成圆木，将它们顺流漂到锯木厂。他们用这些木头造了一艘八十英尺长的平底船，装上培根、玉米、猪肉，沿着密西西比河顺流而下。为此，除了奖金，他每天可赚五十美分。

林肯的工作包括给船员做饭、掌舵、讲故事、玩七点儿(5)以及大声唱歌：

裹着头巾的土耳其人，藐视世界，

昂首阔步，鬓须拳曲，

可除了他自己，没人看他一眼。

这次的沿河旅行给林肯留下了深刻的印象。赫恩登在书中是这样描述的：

在新奥尔良，林肯第一次看到了奴隶制的可怕。他看到“黑人身上锁着铁链，不断地受到鞭打”。面对这种惨绝人寰的暴行，林肯的正义感使他产生了反抗意识。他的观念和良知也因此苏醒了。他终于理解了他曾读过的那些文字、听到的那些话语的意义。奴隶制对林肯影响巨大是毫无疑问的。正如他的一位朋友所言：“奴隶制在他心中打下了烙印。”一天早上，林肯和两位朋友一起在城里漫步，遇到一场奴隶拍卖会。一个健壮标致的黑白混血女孩正在被拍卖。买主们用双手对她里里外外进行了彻底的检查。他们捏她的肉，让她像马一样在房间里跑来跑去以便检查她的活动能力。据拍卖人说，这样做是为了“让买主可以确认”他们买的东西到底值不值得。整个场面令人无比厌恶，林肯心中涌起了一种“无法控制的厌恶感”，于是愤然离开了那里。他对同行的伙伴说：“上帝啊，咱们赶紧离开吧！如果我有机会揍它（奴隶制）一顿，我一定毫不留情。”

林肯和雇他去新奥尔良的货主登顿·奥福特（Denton Offut）处得很好。奥福特喜欢他讲的各种笑话和故事，也喜欢他的诚实。他雇用林肯回到伊利诺伊州，让他伐几棵树，然后在新塞勒姆村用圆木建造一间杂货铺。新塞勒姆村坐落在一处悬崖上，下方便是蜿蜒的桑加蒙河。村子规模很小，只有十五到二十家住户。在新塞勒姆村，林肯不但操持着杂货铺，还经营着一个磨坊和锯木厂。他在那儿度过了对他的未来有着巨大影响的六年。

村子里有一群野蛮好斗爱胡闹的混混，他们自称为“闪耀的丛林男孩”。他们吹嘘自己是伊利诺伊州最能喝威士忌、骂人最绝、最能打架的人。

从品性来说，这些混混都不是坏人。他们忠诚、坦率、慷慨、富有同情心，但就是喜欢炫耀。因此，当喜欢声张的登顿·奥福特来到镇上，大肆宣扬他的杂货铺店员林肯是如何力大无穷时，“闪耀的丛林男孩”便按捺不住了，誓要给这个暴发户一点颜色看看。

但是结果却完全出乎他们的意料。那位高个子年轻人不仅跑得比他们快，跳得比他们高，还能凭借着那双颀长的手臂在扔铁锤和炮弹方面胜过他们所有人。此外，那个年轻人还能讲一些他们能听懂的有趣的故事，而那些边远地区的故事总是能逗得他们哈哈大笑好几个小时。

那一天，全村的人都围在白橡树下，观看林肯和“闪耀的丛林男孩”的头儿杰克·阿姆斯特朗（Jack Armstrong）比赛摔跤。在“闪耀的丛林男孩”看来，当林肯将阿姆斯特朗摔倒在地的时候，他在新塞勒姆村的声望便达到了巅峰。从那以后，丛林男孩们便与他做了朋友，并且十分拥护他。他们委派他做赛马和斗鸡的裁判，在他失业又无家可归的时候把他带回家供他吃住。

在新塞勒姆村，林肯找到了数年来一直渴求的机会——在公众面前克服恐惧，学习演讲。在印第安纳州的时候，能让林肯当众演讲的唯一机会便是在田地里，而观众也只有寥寥几个农民。但在新塞勒姆村，有一个名叫“文学会”的组织，每周六晚都在拉特利奇旅馆的餐厅里聚会。林肯无比热情地参与其中，还成了灵魂人物。他讲故事，朗诵自己写的诗，针对一些话题，例如桑加蒙河的航运问题，做即兴发言，有时还会针对当下的各种问题展开辩论。

这项活动弥足珍贵。它开拓了林肯的眼界，唤醒了他的雄心。他发现自己有一种特殊的能力：能够利用自己的演讲感染旁人。认识到这一点后，他充满勇气，变得前所未有地自信。

几个月后，奥福特的杂货铺倒闭了，林肯因此失去了工作。正巧一场大选在即，整个州都在为政治疯狂，因此林肯打算靠自己的演讲能力闯荡一番。

在当地的格林汉姆老师（Mentor Graham）的帮助下，林肯花了几个星期的时间准备了他的第一次公开演讲。在演讲中，他宣布自己参加州议员竞选。他宣布自己将侧重“内在水平的提高……桑加蒙河的航运问题……更好的教育……公正”等。

在演讲结尾，他说：

“从出生起直到现在，我的生活都很卑微。我没有有钱的或路子广的亲戚朋友推荐我。”紧接着便是一句唤起同情的话，“如果诸位充满智慧的公民认为我就适合待在社会最底层，那我也早已习惯了这种结果将带来的失望和懊恼。”

几天后，有人骑着马风风火火地闯进新塞勒姆村，带来了一条令人震惊的消息：印第安索克族首领黑鹰带着手下的勇士开战了。他们焚烧房屋，掳掠妇女，屠杀移民，罗克河沿岸因此笼罩在一片血腥的恐怖气氛中。

雷诺兹州长（Governor Reynolds）彻底慌了，四处召集志愿军。“失业又身无分文的政界候选人”林肯参加了志愿军，入伍三十天后便升为了队长。他曾试图让“闪耀的丛林男孩”参加训练，但他们的答复是：“见鬼去吧！”

赫恩登说林肯将那场对抗黑鹰的战争看成“一次假日旅行，一场偷鸡般的远征”。事实也确实如此。

后来，林肯在某次国会演说中说道，他在那次战争中根本没有攻击过印第安人，只是“打过野蒜头”。他说他连印第安人的影子都没看见，不过却“和蚊子进行了血淋淋的战斗”。

从战场回来后，“林肯队长”再次投入政治竞选中。他挨家挨户地游走，和人们一一握手，给人们讲故事，认可人们的观点，一旦发现人群便随时随地进行演讲。

大选开始了，林肯失败了。新塞勒姆村一共投出了两百零八票，林肯只获得了三票。

两年后，他再次参选。这一次他当选了。为此，他不得不借钱买了一套可以进入议会的衣服。

林肯分别于一八三六年、一八三八年和一八四〇年三度当选。




当时，在新塞勒姆村有一个游手好闲的家伙，名叫杰克·凯尔索（Jake Kelso）。他的妻子为了生计，不得不招揽房客补贴家用，但他自己却只管钓鱼、拉提琴、朗诵诗歌。村里的大多数人都看不起杰克，觉得他是个失败者，但林肯却很喜欢他，还和他做了朋友，并且深受他的影响。在遇到凯尔索之前，林肯对莎士比亚和彭斯所知甚少，他们对于林肯来说，只是两个模糊的名字。但是现在，当他坐在杰克·凯尔索身旁，听他朗读《哈姆雷特》，背诵《麦克白》的时候，他才第一次认识到英语还能像交响乐一样美妙。那些语言是那么优美，像一阵旋风般席卷了林肯的心灵。

对于莎士比亚，林肯充满着敬仰之心；但对彭斯，他是热爱、同情的，甚至觉得自己和彭斯血肉相连。彭斯曾和林肯一样贫穷。彭斯出生的小屋和林肯出生的小屋一样破旧。彭斯也是农家子弟。彭斯善良敏感，对他来说，在地里用犁翻出一窝田鼠是一件值得写入诗歌永久记忆的哀伤故事。彭斯和莎士比亚的诗歌为林肯开启了一个充满意义、情感和爱的世界。

但最让林肯震惊的是，莎士比亚和彭斯都没上过大学。他们和他一样，并没有接受过多的学校教育。

这让林肯忍不住想，也许，没读过什么书的自己——目不识丁的汤姆·林肯的儿子——也能像他们一样成就一番事业。也许，这样的自己不一定一辈子都只是一个杂货铺店员或铁匠。

从那时起，彭斯和莎士比亚成了他最喜欢的作家。他读的莎士比亚的作品比读的其他作家的作品加起来还要多。这对他的文风产生了很大的影响。甚至在他入主白宫之后，当内战所带来的重负和忧虑在他的脸上刻下深深的皱纹时，他仍会花很多时间阅读莎士比亚的作品。他虽然日理万机，但仍会抽出时间和研究莎士比亚的专家们讨论戏剧，或者就某些特定篇章与他们通信交流。在遇刺的那个星期，他曾花费两个小时为一圈朋友大声朗读《麦克白》。

新塞勒姆村那个得过且过的渔民杰克·凯尔索带给林肯的影响一直持续到他进入白宫。

新塞勒姆村的创建人，也是一家旅馆的主人，名叫詹姆斯·拉特利奇（James Rutledge），是一个南方人，有一个极其迷人的女儿，名叫安。林肯遇到她的时候，她只有十九岁。安长得很漂亮，有一双迷人的蓝眼睛，还有一头赭色的头发。虽然她已经和村里最有钱的商人订了婚，但林肯还是爱上了她。

安已经答应嫁给约翰·麦克尼尔（John McNeil），但双方约定两年后等她读完大学再结婚。

林肯刚到新塞勒姆村不久，村里便发生了一件怪事。麦克尼尔卖掉了自己的商店，说要回到纽约州将他的父母和家人接到伊利诺伊州来。但在临走前，他向安·拉特利奇坦白了一些事情，安差点没吓晕过去。但当时安很年轻，也很爱他，所以选择相信了他的故事。

几天后，麦克尼尔从新塞勒姆村出发了，挥手向安告别，并许诺会给她写信。

当时，林肯是村里的邮递员。驿站的马车每周会送两次信，但通常都只有寥寥几封，因为根据邮程长短，寄一封信要花费六点二五美分到二十五美分不等。林肯将信放在帽子里，当人们遇到他向他询问是否有自己的信时，他总会摘下帽子，查找一番。

每周安·拉特利奇都会询问两次是否有她的信。三个月过去了，她收到了麦克尼尔的第一封信。麦克尼尔在信中解释之所以没有很快给她写信，是因为他在穿越俄亥俄州的时候生病发高烧，在床上躺了三个礼拜，其中多数时间处于昏迷状态。

又过了三个月，安收到了第二封信。但这封信对于安来说，还不如没收到来得好。麦克尼尔的语气冷淡又含混。他说他的父亲病得很重，说自己一直被父亲的债权人骚扰，还说不知道什么时候才能回来。

在那之后，安又等了几个月，但再也没有收到麦克尼尔的任何消息。他真的爱过自己吗？她开始怀疑。

林肯看到了安的消沉，于是自愿帮安寻找麦克尼尔的下落。

“不用了，”她说，“他知道我在哪里，如果他都不愿意费心给我写信，我也肯定不会费心让你去找他。”

然后她告诉了父亲麦克尼尔临走之前坦白的事情。麦克尼尔坦白自己多年来一直在用化名，他的真名并不是新塞勒姆村的人所熟知的“麦克尼尔”，而是叫“麦克纳马”。

他为什么要骗人呢？他解释道，因为他的父亲在纽约州做生意失败了，负债累累。作为长子的他没有告知家人自己的去向，只身来到了西部赚钱。他担心如果用了真名，他的家人会发现他的下落，然后找到他。这样他就必须帮他们还钱。但他不希望自己在努力重新开始的时候被如此重担拖累，他很可能因此白干很多年，所以他用了化名。但现在他已经积累了很多财富，所以打算将父母接到伊利诺伊州，让他们分享自己的财富。

这件事在村里传开后，引起了不小的轰动。大家都认为麦克尼尔是个大骗子，他的故事纯粹是个谎言。情况看上去很糟，而流言蜚语让事情变得更糟了。没有人知道他到底是什么人。也许他已经结过婚，也许他在外面藏了两三个老婆，也许他抢过银行，也许他杀过人。也许他是这样，也许他是那样，没有人知道真相。不过，庆幸的是他抛弃了安·拉特利奇。为此，安真应该感谢上帝。

这些都是新塞勒姆村村民的想法。林肯什么也没说，但思考了很多。

终于，他一直期待着、祈祷着的机会来临了。

拉特利奇旅馆和西部其他数千个圆木小屋一样，外观粗糙，常年经受风吹雨打，路过的陌生人都不会看它一眼。但对于林肯来说，他的眼睛，他的心，早已一刻都离不开它了。在林肯看来，这座小屋包罗万象，高耸入天际。每次他跨过旅馆的门槛时，心跳就会猛然加速。

他从杰克·凯尔索那儿借了一本莎士比亚的书，躺在杂货铺的长条桌上，翻开书页，一遍又一遍地朗读：

嘘！那边窗户里亮起的是什么光？

哦，那是东方，朱丽叶就是太阳！

他合上书，无法阅读，无法思考。他躺在那里，度过梦幻般的一小时，重温着记忆中安昨天晚上说的每一件美妙的事。他现在只为一件事而活——与安在一起。

在那个时代，流行举办缝被派对。安总是受到邀请，是派对的常客。缝衣针在她那纤细的手指间飞舞，一件不同寻常的艺术品转眼间便被做了出来。早上，林肯总是陪着安一起骑马去往聚会地点，晚上再接她回家。有一次，他竟厚着脸皮走了进去——要知道，几乎没有男人胆敢闯入这种场合——坐在安旁边。她的心一阵悸动，一缕绯红升上了她的脸颊。她太激动了，指间的缝衣针不听使唤，于是她的针脚全乱了。那些年长的妇女可沉着多了，她们注意到了安的反常，却什么都没说，只是微微一笑。派对的主人一直保存着这条被子，在林肯成为总统后，她曾自豪地向游客展示总统曾经的心上人缝制的这件针脚凌乱的作品。

夏日的夜晚，林肯和安漫步在桑加蒙河畔，夜莺在树上鸣叫，萤火虫在夜幕中织出了美丽的金线。秋天的时候，他们常去树林里游荡。林中的橡树层林尽染，山核桃啪嗒啪嗒地掉落在地上。到了冬天，待下过雪，他们便徒步穿过森林，途中看到：

每一棵橡树、白蜡树和胡桃树

都披着伯爵也买不起的白貂皮，

就连榆树最瘦小的枝丫

也缀满了一英寸厚的珍珠。

对于他们来说，两人现在的生命具有一种神圣的温柔，一种崭新的、异常美好的意义。每当林肯只是站着俯视安那双蓝色的眼睛时，她的心中便会荡起歌声。对于林肯来说，哪怕只是轻轻地触碰安的双手，也会让他激动地屏住呼吸，从而惊讶地发现，原来世界上竟然有如此美好的幸福。

在这之前，林肯和牧师的酒鬼儿子贝利（Berry）合伙做生意。新塞勒姆村人烟日渐稀少，村里所有的商店都在苟延残喘。但林肯和贝利都没有预见这一点。他们买下了三间残破的木屋杂货店，重新整修了一番，开始了自己的生意。

一天，一位迁往爱荷华州的旅人驾着一辆盖着粗布、载满物品的马车来到了林肯和贝利的商店前。路面泥泞，马儿也很疲乏，于是这位旅人想减轻马车的负荷。他想将一桶家用物品卖给林肯。林肯本不想要，但又同情马儿，于是花了五十五美分买下了这一桶废物，看也不看便将大桶滚到了商店的后屋。

两周后，他闲来无聊，便将大桶中的东西倒在了地上，想看看自己到底买了什么。在这堆垃圾的下面，林肯发现了一本完整的《布莱克斯通法律评注》，于是他便阅读起来。农民们都在地里干活，商店几乎没什么客人，所以他有很多闲暇时间。他越往下读，越感兴趣。从来没有哪本书让他这么着迷。他一口气读完了四卷书。

然后他做了一个重大的决定：他要成为一名律师。如果安·拉特利奇能嫁给一位律师，她一定感到非常骄傲。安支持他的想法，他们约好等他完成法学课程并开始执业时就结婚。

读完了布莱克斯通的书后，他便穿过平原，去往二十英里外的春田市向一位他在抵抗“黑鹰”的战斗中认识的律师借阅其他法律书籍。回来的路上，他将书在手中摊开，边走边读。每当遇到难懂之处，他便会拖着脚步慢慢停下，全神贯注地思考，直至茅塞顿开。

他读啊读，就这样读了二三十页，直至黄昏降临，天黑得看不见路。这时天空缀满繁星，他也饿了，于是加快了脚步。

他将时间都花在了学习上，心无旁骛。白天的时候他躺在商店旁的榆树荫下，将光着的脚丫架在树干上，认真地读书。晚上的时候他便去修桶匠的店里，用周围的废料点灯，全神贯注地学习。他总是大声朗读书上的内容，然后合上书，写下刚才所读的要点，再不断修改完善，直至幼童也能看懂其中清晰的条理和含义。

林肯不管去哪里——在河边闲逛也好，在林中散步也好，去田里干活也好——他的胳膊下都夹着一本奇蒂或布莱克斯通的法律书。有一次一个农民雇他砍柴，中午这位农民路过仓库，却发现林肯光脚坐在角落的柴堆上学习法律。

格林汉姆老师告诉林肯，如果他渴望在政法界出人头地，就一定要学习语法。

“去哪里借语法书呢？”林肯问道。

格林汉姆老师说六英里外的村子里有一个叫约翰·万斯（John Vance）的农民，他有一本《柯克姆语法》。林肯听后立刻站了起来，戴上帽子借书去了。

他掌握柯克姆语法的速度着实让格林汉姆老师震惊。三十年后已是校长的格林汉姆说，他教过五千多名学生，但林肯是他遇到过的“最好学，最勤奋，对知识和文学的追求最诚挚的学生”。

“我了解林肯，”格林汉姆老师说，“为了在三种表述方式中选出最佳选项，他可以一连研究好几个小时。”

掌握了柯克姆语法后，林肯又如饥似渴地读完了吉本的《罗马帝国衰亡史》，罗林的《古代史》，一卷美国军队传，杰斐逊、克雷和韦伯斯特的生平，以及汤姆·佩因（Tom Paine）的《理性时代》。

穿着“一件蓝色棉布短外套，一双笨重的靴子，一条与上衣相差三英寸、与袜子相距一两英寸的淡蓝色马裤”的杰出青年林肯，在新塞勒姆村四处游荡，四处读书学习，四处做梦讲故事，而且“到哪儿都有一群朋友”。

后来，杰出的林肯研究专家阿尔伯特·J.贝弗里奇（Albert J. Beveridge）在他那本里程碑般的传记中写道：

林肯吸引民众的不仅是他的智慧、善良和广博的知识，还有他的奇装异服和笨拙。这些都是他的招牌，尤其是那条够不到脚踝的裤子，总是被人们津津乐道。不久，亚伯拉罕·林肯成了家喻户晓的名字。

林肯和贝利合伙开的店铺还是倒闭了。这是可以预见的——林肯整日沉迷书本，贝利整日喝得醉醺醺的——店铺倒闭是迟早的事。现在，林肯连一分食宿费都没有了，于是他不得不到处找体力活儿干：砍灌木，扬干草，筑篱笆，为谷子脱粒，在锯木厂打工，还做过一阵子铁匠。

之后，在格林汉姆老师的帮助下，他投入了错综复杂的三角学和对数的学习，以便做一个测量员。他赊账买了一匹马和一个罗盘，砍了一根葡萄藤做链子，以每次三十七美分半的价格测量市中心的各个地段。

与此同时，拉特利奇旅馆也倒闭了。林肯的心上人不得不去农户家里帮厨。很快，林肯就在那户农民家里找到了犁玉米的活。晚上，安在厨房洗碗，他就站在一旁擦盘子。一想到可以走近她，林肯的心中就充满了巨大的幸福感。在以后的生命中，他再也没有体会过如此炙热的幸福感和满足感。在他去世前不久，他曾向一个朋友坦白，在伊利诺伊州做赤脚农民的时光，远比在白宫的日子幸福。

然而，这对恋人的幸福既浓烈又短暂。一八三五年八月，安病倒了。她一开始也没有什么疼痛的地方，就是觉得疲倦困乏。她努力像往常一样工作，但某天早晨，她连起床的力气都没有了。那一天，她发起了高烧，她的哥哥骑马去新塞勒姆村找艾伦医生。医生诊断是伤寒。她的身体如火般滚烫，但她的脚却像冰一样冷，要用滚烫的石头暖着才行。她总是要水喝。现代医学建议，这种情况应该用冰块给她降温，再让她多喝水。但艾伦医生并不知道应该这样做。

就这样过了可怕的几周。最后，安连从床上举起手的力气都没有了。艾伦医生说安需要静养，禁止任何访客。那一晚，甚至林肯都不被允许探望她。第二天以及接下来的一天，安嘴里一直含糊地喊着林肯的名字，于是家人喊来了林肯。林肯到达后立即走到了她的床边。门关着，房间里只有他们两个人。这便是这对情侣一起度过的最后的时光。

第二天，安失去了意识，然后再也没有醒来。

安去世后的几个星期是林肯一生中最惨淡的时光。他无法入睡，也吃不下任何东西。他不断地说自己也不想活了，甚至试图自杀。他的朋友们警觉起来，拿走了他随身的便刀，小心地看着他，以防他投河自尽。他变得不愿见人，即便见了人也不愿说话，甚至看都不看他们。他似乎总是在凝视着另一个世界，而忘记了现实世界的存在。

他每天都步行五英里去安的长眠之处——“和谐公墓”。有的时候，他在那儿待得太久，朋友们担心他，就去墓地带他回家。下大雨的时候，他就哭喊着说，无法忍受安的坟墓任凭风雨侵袭。

有一次，人们发现林肯在桑加蒙河畔跌跌撞撞地走着，嘴里语无伦次地说着破碎的句子。人们担心他疯了。

于是人们请来了艾伦医生。医生知道林肯得的是心病，便要求他必须做些工作，以便分散注意力。

村子北面一英里处住着林肯的密友宝林·格林（Bowling Greene），他将林肯接到了家中，无微不至地照顾着。此地非常安静，与世隔绝。房子背面是高耸的悬崖，上面长满了橡树，一直向西边延展开去。房子前面是一片低洼地，一直延伸至桑加蒙河畔，四周种满了树木。格林的太太南希给林肯派了很多活儿：砍树、挖土豆、摘苹果、挤奶以及在她纺纱的时候帮她拿住纱线。

日子一天天过去，转眼间，已过去了好几年，但林肯仍旧十分悲伤。在一八三七年，也就是安去世两年后，他对州议会的一位议员同伴说道：

“虽然在他人看来，我有时过得很快活，但当我独自一人时，我其实非常悲伤，我甚至不敢随身带便刀，就怕自己做出什么事来。”

自安去世那天起，林肯就变了一个人。虽然他有时也能短暂地摆脱那份哀愁，但他心中的哀伤却仍旧与日俱增。最后，林肯成了伊利诺伊州最悲伤的人。

他后来在法律上的合伙人赫恩登说：“这二十年来，我实在没看到林肯有哪一天是快乐的……他走路的时候哀伤就从他的身上一滴滴淌下来。”

在此后的一生中，林肯便喜欢上了表达哀伤和死亡的诗句。他的喜欢甚至可以说是一种痴迷。他常常一连坐上好几个小时，一言不发，陷入沉思。他的身影就是对哀伤最好的诠释。然后他会突然背起《最后的叶子》中的诗句来：

长满苔藓的石板

盖在他曾热吻过的

如鲜花般绚烂的嘴唇上；

令他欣喜的名字

刻在墓碑上，

经历了岁月的风霜。

安去世后不久，林肯记住了一首名叫《人固有一死》的诗。诗的开头是这样的：“人啊，你有什么值得骄傲的呢？”这首诗成了他的最爱。当他独自一人时常常背诵这首诗。他曾在伊利诺伊州的乡村旅馆里向众人背诵过这首诗，他也曾在公众演讲中引用过这首诗，还在白宫会见客人以及给朋友写信时提到这首诗。他在给朋友的信中说到：

“如果可以拥有写出这种诗歌的才华，我愿意为此倾尽所有财产，哪怕债务缠身也在所不惜。”

他最喜欢诗的最后两节：

是啊！希望和失望，欢乐和痛苦，

都和阳光与雨水交织在一起；

笑声和泪水，欢歌与挽歌，

彼此相随，就像浪花前后相逐。



眨眼吐息之间，

健康蓬勃的生命就变成了苍白的死亡，

金光闪耀的厅堂变成了棺材与坟墓——

人啊，你有什么值得骄傲的呢？

安·拉特利奇长眠的“和谐公墓”位于一处安静的农田中央，非常清净。公墓的三面都是麦田，另一面是一片绿油油的牧场，总有牛羊在那里吃草。现在公墓周围长满了灌木丛和藤条，几乎无人问津。每到春天，鹌鹑就在里面筑巢。那里安静极了，偶尔能听到绵羊的咩咩声和白鸽的咕咕声。

安·拉特利奇在此地安静地长眠了半个多世纪。但在一八九〇年，一位当地的殡葬承办人在四英里外的彼得斯堡开办了一个新的公墓。彼得斯堡已经有了一处漂亮气派的“玫瑰山墓园”，因此新墓地卖得很慢。结果，这个贪婪的殡葬承办人在某个邪恶的时刻想出了一个可怕的点子：毁掉林肯心上人的墓地，将她的遗骨迁到他的新墓地，以此作为招牌刺激销售。

按照这位殡葬承办人提供的令人震惊的供词，“大约在一八九〇年五月十五日”，他挖开了安的坟墓。他找到了什么呢？多亏现在仍住在彼得斯堡的一位老妇人，我们才得以知道事情的原委。这位老妇人是安·拉特利奇的大表兄麦克格雷迪·拉特利奇（McGrady Rutledge）的女儿，她以书面形式保证所提供的信息是真实的。麦克格雷迪·拉特利奇曾和林肯一起在田间干活，帮着林肯测绘土地，和林肯同吃同住，因此对林肯与安之间的感情，他比其他任何人都清楚。

在一个宁静的夏日的夜晚，这位老妇人坐在门廊上的摇椅中，缓缓地对笔者说道：“我经常听父亲说，安死后，林肯先生总会步行五英里去安的坟墓，一待就是很久。父亲见他一直不回来，担心他出事，便总是去墓地将他带回来……那位殡葬承办人挖开安的坟墓时父亲也在场。我常听父亲说，当时他们找到的唯一遗物，竟然只是安裙子上的四颗珍珠纽扣。”

于是，那位殡葬承办人带走了那四颗珍珠纽扣以及几捧黄土，把它们埋在彼得斯堡的“奥克兰公墓”，然后打出了安·拉特利奇长眠于此的广告。

现在，每到夏季，数以千计的朝圣者便会驱车前往此地，瞻仰所谓的安的坟墓。我曾见到他们站在那四颗纽扣前，低着头，眼中满是泪水。在那四颗纽扣上面是一座漂亮的花岗岩墓碑，上面刻着埃德加·李·马斯特斯（Edgar Lee Masters）的《匙河诗集》中的诗句：

从我这个微不足道，默默无名的女子口中

荡起一首永恒的乐曲：

“对谁都勿有恶意，对谁都心怀悲悯。”

宽恕众生，让慈悲充满整个国家，

真理之光在闪耀。

我是安·拉特利奇，长眠于青草之下；

我是亚伯拉罕·林肯的挚爱，

并非通过结合，而是通过分离，

我和林肯永远成了夫妻。

透过胸前的尘埃，

合众国啊，愿你永远昌盛！

然而，安神圣的遗骨依旧留在那古老的“和谐公墓”中。贪婪的殡葬承办人带走了她的纽扣，但无法带走她留在那片土地上的回忆和遗骨。在那里，白鸽咕咕地叫着，野玫瑰静静地盛开。在那里，林肯曾洒下热泪。那块土地也因此变得神圣起来。林肯曾说，他的心和安一起埋在了那里。这也是安·拉特利奇的心愿。

一八三七年三月，安去世两年后，林肯离开了新塞勒姆村。他借了一匹马，出发前往春田市，开始他所谓的“实习律师”的生涯。

他把行李装在一个马鞍包中。他的全部家当除了几本法律书，只剩几件衬衫和内衣。他还带着一只蓝色的旧袜子，里面塞满了面值六点二五美分和十二点五美分的硬币——都是他在新塞勒姆村邮局歇业前收的邮资。刚到春田市的第一年，林肯处处都要花钱，手头总是紧巴巴的。他本可以挪用这笔邮资，之后再还给政府，但他却觉得这样不诚实。因此，当邮局的稽核员来收账时，林肯手中的邮资不仅数量上分毫不差，就连那些硬币都是当初他做邮局局长那一两年期间收来的样子。

那个早晨，当林肯骑着马前往春田市的时候，他不仅没有自己的储蓄，更糟的是，他还背了一千一百美元的债务。这是当初他和贝利在新塞勒姆村一起经营那间短命的杂货铺时亏损的钱，但贝利把自己喝死了，留下林肯独自面对这笔债务。

当然，林肯完全可以不偿还这笔债务。他本可以请求分摊责任，接着声称生意失败，再利用法律的漏洞躲避这笔债务。

但林肯并未这么做。相反，他主动地拜访债主，请求他们给自己一些时间，并承诺会连本带息一分不少地归还所有欠款。除了一个叫皮特·凡·伯根（Peter Van Bergen）的，其他债主都同意了林肯的请求。伯根提出了诉讼，胜诉后拍卖了林肯的马和测绘仪器。其他债主则耐心地等待着，而林肯为了信守自己对他们的诺言，十四年间节衣缩食，拼命存钱，直到一八四八年成为国会议员后，才用部分薪水还清了最后一部分债务。

到达春田市的那个早上，林肯将马拴在了公共广场西北角的约书亚·F.斯皮德（Joshua F. Speed）杂货店门口。对于那段故事，斯皮德这样回忆道：

他骑着一匹借来的马来到了春田市，向村里唯一做家具的木匠订了一张单人床架。他走进我的店铺，将马鞍包放在柜台上，问我做一张单人床架要多少钱。我拿出了写字板和铅笔，算了一下材料费，发现总共需要十七美金。这时他说：“这个价格也许是很便宜了，但坦白说，虽然很便宜，可我还是买不起。如果你允许我赊账，那么到圣诞节的时候，若我的律师事业成功了，我一定会如数奉还，但如果失败了，我也许永远都还不起。”我深切地感受到他的声音中有一股浓浓的哀伤。我抬头看着他，当时我认为——我现在也这么认为——那是我这辈子见过的最悲伤的脸庞。于是我对他说：“这笔小钱似乎给你带来了极大的困扰，我有一个主意，可以让你既有地方睡觉，又不用背负任何债务。我有一间大房间，里面有一张双人床，如果你愿意的话，欢迎你和我一起住。”“你的房间在哪里？”他问道。“楼上。”我指着通往房间的楼梯说道。他一句话也没说，拎起马鞍包就走上了楼梯。他把包放在地板上，又走下楼来，脸上堆满了满足的笑容。“斯皮德，我真是太感动了。”他大声地说道。

于是，在往后的五年半时间里，林肯和斯皮德同住在杂货铺楼上的房间里，没有付一分钱房租。

另外一位朋友威廉·巴特勒（William Butler）不仅为林肯提供了五年食宿，还为他买了很多衣服。

当时，林肯可能在有能力的时候给过巴特勒一些钱，但巴特勒从未明确地向林肯收过费，这完全是出于朋友间真挚的友谊。

对此，林肯深表感激。若不是巴特勒和斯皮德的资助，他的律师事业不可能成功。

林肯和另一位名叫斯图亚特的律师合伙办了事务所。斯图亚特的大部分时间都花在政治上，事务所的事全扔给林肯。但事务所也没什么事，而他们的办公室也没什么东西，家具只有“一张又小又脏的床、一件用水牛皮做的及膝风衣、一把椅子、一张长凳”以及一个放着几卷法律书的类似书架的架子。

从事务所的记录来看，前六个月中公司只收取了五笔费用：一笔二点五美元，两笔五美元，一笔十美元，还有一笔收了一件大衣当作部分佣金。

林肯非常沮丧，有一天，他来到春田市的佩吉·伊顿（Page Eaton）木匠铺，坦承自己想放弃法律改学木匠。几年前，当他还在新塞勒姆村学习法律的时候，就曾认真地考虑过放弃书本成为一个铁匠。

对于林肯来说，在春田市的第一年是一段孤独的时光。有时在晚上，偶尔有几个男人来到斯皮德店铺后面，他们一起谈论政治，打发时光。他们是林肯仅仅认识的几个人。星期天的时候，林肯不愿意去教堂，因为——按照他的说法——不知道在春田市那些体面的教堂里该做些什么。

在第一年里，只有一个女人和他说过话。他在给朋友的信中写道，“如果她当时能避开”，她是不会和自己说话的。

但是，在一八三九年，一位女士来到了春田市，她不仅和林肯说话，还主动追求林肯，并一心想要嫁给他。她的名字叫玛丽·托德（Mary Todd）。

曾有人问林肯，为什么托德家的人要这样拼写自己的姓氏。林肯说，上帝（God）只要一个d就够了，但托德家要两个d才够。

托德家一直吹嘘自己家族历史悠久，可以追溯至公元六世纪。玛丽·托德的祖父、曾祖父和曾叔父们都是将军和地方长官，其中有一位曾位居海军部长。玛丽自己也受过良好的教育，曾就读于肯塔基州的列克星敦的一所法国学校。这所学校是由法国贵族维多利亚·夏洛特·乐克利尔·曼特尔夫人（Madame Victorie Charlotte Le Clere Mentelle）和她的丈夫开办的。在大革命期间，他们为了躲避被断头铡处死的厄运，从巴黎逃到了美国。他们训练玛丽说巴黎腔的法语，教她跳身着丝绸的朝臣们在凡尔赛宫常跳的沙龙舞和切尔克斯圈舞。

玛丽举止高傲，自视甚高，她一直坚信总有一天自己要嫁的男人会成为美国总统。这个想法虽然令人难以置信，但玛丽不仅坚信这点，还公然到处吹嘘。人们嘲笑她这番愚蠢的言论，还对她指指点点，但这些都未曾动摇她的信念，也没能阻止她到处吹嘘。

玛丽的亲姐姐在谈到玛丽时说她“热爱虚荣、炫耀和权力”，并且是“我认识的最具野心的女人”。

不幸的是，玛丽脾气暴躁，时不时就会大发雷霆，于是在一八三九年的某天，她和继母大吵了一架，夺门而去，怒气冲冲地离开了父亲的家，前往春田市投靠自己已婚的姐姐。

对于一心一意要嫁给未来总统的玛丽来说，毫无疑问她选对了地方。放眼全世界，没有哪个地方比伊利诺伊州的春田市更能实现她的愿望了。虽然在当时，春田市还只是一个大草原上的肮脏的边境小镇，没有铺好的公路，没有电灯，没有人行道，没有下水道，牛群随意漫步，猪在主街上的泥洞里打滚，空气中充满了成堆的肥料腐烂后散发的恶臭。一八三九年的时候，春田市的人口只有一千五百人，其中却包括了注定成为一八六〇年总统选举候选人的两位青年——民主党北翼候选人史蒂芬·道格拉斯（Stephen A. Douglas）和共和党候选人亚伯拉罕·林肯。

他们两人都遇见了玛丽·托德，并同时追求过她，都曾将她拥入怀中。而玛丽也曾说过，两人都向她求过婚。

据她姐姐回忆，当有人问玛丽两位追求者中她更愿意嫁给谁时，她总是说“那个更有希望成为总统的人”。

而这就等同于选择了道格拉斯，因为在那时，道格拉斯的政治前景比林肯光明一百倍。虽然道格拉斯只有二十六岁，却已有了“小巨人”的绰号，而且已成为州议员。而林肯只是一个寄居在斯皮德杂货店阁楼上、连住宿费都付不起的、为了生计而挣扎的小律师。

道格拉斯成名很早，早在林肯还不为外州所知的时候，他就已经注定成为美国最强的政治力量了。事实上，在林肯当选总统的两年前，普通美国百姓对林肯的了解还停留在他曾经和聪明、强大的史蒂芬·道格拉斯进行过辩论。

玛丽的亲戚都以为相较于林肯，她更中意道格拉斯，而事实上她也很可能确实这样认为。道格拉斯不仅仅是一个更好的丈夫人选，和林肯比起来，他个性更迷人，前途更远大，举止更得体，社会地位也更高。

此外，他还有一副浑厚动听的嗓音和一头向后梳着的黑色鬈发。他跳华尔兹的舞技一流，而且还会对玛丽施以可人的小小赞美。

他是玛丽的梦中情人。她曾看着镜中的自己，悄声地称自己“玛丽·托德·道格拉斯”。这个名字听着美极了，而她也幻想着有朝一日能和道格拉斯在白宫跳华尔兹。

道格拉斯在追求玛丽的时候，有一天在春田市的公共广场上和人打了一架。那人是一位新闻编辑，也是玛丽最要好的朋友的丈夫。

也许是玛丽告诉了道格拉斯自己对于这件事的看法。

也许玛丽还告诉了他她对于其他一些事——例如，他在公共宴会上喝得酩酊大醉，爬上桌子跳华尔兹，大喊大叫，唱歌，踢翻了酒杯、烤火鸡、威士忌酒瓶和盛肉的盘子——的看法。

此外，当他一边想引起玛丽的关注，一边又和其他女子跳舞时，玛丽总会表现出不悦。总之，两人的关系最后不了了之。参议员贝弗里奇这样说道：

虽然之后有传言道格拉斯曾经向玛丽求婚却遭到了拒绝，因为他“德行不佳”，但这种说辞很显然是这种情况下惯用的保护性宣传，因为精明机敏甚至世故的道格拉斯从来没有向托德小姐求过婚。

出于极度的失望，玛丽便想通过向道格拉斯的政治劲敌亚伯拉罕·林肯表达炙热的爱意而唤起他的嫉妒心。但道格拉斯并未因此回心转意，于是她的捕猎目标最终变成了林肯。玛丽的姐姐爱德华夫人之后曾这样描述玛丽和林肯的这段关系：

玛丽和林肯先生共处时，我恰好经常在场。玛丽永远都是话题的引导者，林肯先生就坐在她旁边，静静地听着。他几乎不说话，却总是凝视着玛丽，就好像被一股看不见的强大力量拉扯着，忍不住靠近玛丽，玛丽的机智敏捷和聪慧让他倾倒。不过和玛丽这样出身的女子相处，林肯先生还是有些笨拙。

那年七月，众人议论数月之久的辉格党（Whigs）大集会终于在春田市召开了，春田市也因此人潮涌动。他们从几百英里以外赶来，挥舞着旗帜，吹吹打打。芝加哥代表团坐着一艘政府派出的双桅帆船，横跨半个州而来。船上乐声飘扬，姑娘们翩翩起舞，礼炮声响彻天空。

民主党曾说辉格党的候选人威廉·亨利·哈里森（William Henry Harrison）像一个住在小木屋里喝着苹果酒的老太太。于是辉格党就真的造了一座有轮子的小木屋，让三十头牛拉着它在春田市的街上游行。木屋旁边还栽了一棵山胡桃树，浣熊在树上玩耍，门口还放着一桶带龙头的苹果酒。

到了晚上，在火把的照耀下，林肯发表了一场政治演说。

在一次会议中，他所在的辉格党曾因贵族化——穿着精致的贵族衣服，却向平民争取选票——而被谴责。对此，林肯回应道：

“我来到伊利诺伊州的时候，是一个贫穷而古怪、没什么朋友、没接受过什么教育的小子。我最初在一艘平底船上工作，一个月挣八美金。我只有一条裤子，还是鹿皮做的。鹿皮湿了再晒干后就会缩水，因此我的裤子一直在缩水，渐渐地，我的裤脚和袜子之间裸露出了几英寸的皮肤。随着我逐渐长高，鹿皮裤子也在不断湿水，不断缩短，于是我的腿上留下了一圈蓝色的印子，直到现在还能看见。因此，如果你们认为这也算是穿着精致衣服的贵族，那我为此向大家道歉。”

民众一边吹着口哨，一边尖叫着表示赞同。

当林肯和玛丽抵达爱德华家的时候，玛丽告诉林肯，自己为他感到骄傲。她还说，他是一名出色的演说家，总有一天会成为总统。

他低头看着身旁沐浴在月光下的玛丽，她的举止已经说明了一切。他伸出手臂，将她圈入怀中，温柔地亲吻着……

他们的婚礼定在一八四一年一月的第一天。

六个月后，他们便会举行婚礼，但在此之前，山雨欲来风满楼。

玛丽·托德和亚伯拉罕·林肯订婚没多久就对林肯不满起来，总是希望林肯改头换面。她不喜欢林肯的着装，经常拿自己的父亲与林肯做比较。这些年来，每天早晨玛丽都能看到她的父亲罗伯特·托德（Robert Todd）手持金手杖，身着蓝色绒面呢外套，白色亚麻长裤，裤腿束在靴子里，体面地行走在列克星敦的大街上。而林肯却完全是另外一副样子。天气炎热的时候，他便不穿外套，更糟的是，他有时甚至连衬领都不穿。他通常只用一根吊带拴着他的裤子，而如果扣子掉了，他就削一颗木钉把布料钉起来。

如此不成熟的行为激怒了玛丽·托德，她也毫不掩饰地向林肯表达了不满。不幸的是，她的表达方式丝毫没有技巧和温柔可言。

虽然早在列克星敦玛丽就曾在维多利亚·夏洛特·乐克利尔·曼特尔夫人的学校学过如何跳沙龙舞，但却未曾学习掌控男人的艺术。于是她选择了一条万无一失的快速毁掉男人感情的道路：没完没了地唠叨。她的唠叨让林肯非常不自在，以至于到了想要躲避她的地步。从前林肯一周总要陪她两三晚，但现在十天也不联系她。而玛丽仍旧一直写信给林肯，抱怨他的冷淡。

没过多久，玛蒂尔达·爱德华（Matilda Edwards）来到了春田市。玛蒂尔达身材高挑，举止庄重，是一个惹眼的金发美人。她是玛丽的姐夫尼尼安·W.爱德华（Ninian W. Edwards）的堂妹，因此也住在了爱德华家宽敞的宅邸中。每当林肯去爱德华家看望玛丽时，玛蒂尔达总是设法让自己变得引人注目。虽然她不会说巴黎腔的法语，也不会跳切尔克斯圈舞，但她懂得如何掌控男人，而林肯也非常喜欢她。当她庄重地走进房间时，林肯的注意力全落在了她身上。他目不转睛地盯着她，有时甚至都没听到玛丽在说什么。对此，玛丽非常愤怒。有一次，林肯带玛丽去参加舞会，但他并不热衷跳舞，于是便让玛丽和别的男人跳舞，而自己则坐在角落里和玛蒂尔达聊天。

玛丽谴责林肯爱上了玛蒂尔达，林肯也并未否认。玛丽崩溃了，号啕大哭，要求林肯今后再也不许看玛蒂尔达一眼。

原先的浓情蜜意现在却只剩下吵架和挑刺。

林肯终于发现，他和玛丽在教育、背景、脾气、品味和精神面貌方面完全不同。他们时常激怒对方。林肯意识到，他们的婚约不应继续下去，因为他们的结合将是一场灾难。

玛丽的姐姐和姐夫也持有相同的看法。他们告诫玛丽放弃和林肯结婚的念头，一遍又一遍地劝说玛丽，她和林肯之间极其不合适，婚姻毫无幸福可言。

但是玛丽根本不听劝。

经过几个星期的酝酿，林肯终于鼓起勇气，决定告诉玛丽自己的真实想法。一天晚上，他来到斯皮德的店里，走到壁炉前，从口袋里拿出一封信，让斯皮德读给他听。对于这件事，斯皮德回忆道：

那封信是写给玛丽·托德的。在信中，林肯坦白了自己的感受，并告诉玛丽自己冷静地充分地考虑了他们的感情，发现自己对她的爱并未达到结婚的程度。他希望我替他递交这封信。我拒绝了，他便赌气说要将信托付给其他人。我提醒他，一旦玛丽·托德拿到了这封信，她便占了上风。“在私人谈话中，”我说，“你说的话也许会被忘记，也许会被误解，也许会不被人注意，可一旦你把那些话变成了白纸黑字，它们便成了永恒的证据。”因此，我将那封不祥的信扔进了壁炉。

因此，我们永远也无法知道林肯到底对玛丽说过什么，但是，“我们可以从他给欧文斯小姐（Miss Owens）的最后一封信中，”参议员贝弗里奇说，“推测出他对玛丽说过的话。”

我们简短地说一下林肯和欧文斯小姐之间的故事。那是四年前的事了。林肯在新塞勒姆村认识了贝内特·艾贝尔太太（Mrs. Bennett Abell），欧文斯小姐是她的妹妹。一八三六年的秋天，艾贝尔太太回到肯塔基州探望亲人，她说，如果林肯愿意娶她的妹妹，她这次就把欧文斯小姐带回伊利诺伊州。

林肯曾在三年前见过欧文斯小姐，对她印象还不错，于是他答应了艾贝尔太太的请求。转眼间，欧文斯小姐就出现在了林肯面前。她有一张漂亮的脸蛋，有教养，受过教育，也有钱，但林肯并不愿意娶她，认为她“有点儿太主动了”。此外，她比林肯年长一岁，又矮又胖，林肯说她“和福斯塔夫(6)倒是天生一对”。

“我一点儿也不喜欢她，”林肯说，“但我能怎么办？”

艾贝尔夫人“非常急切地”希望林肯遵守承诺。但他做不到。他承认自己对于同意订婚的“轻率举动一直非常懊悔”，而这种懊悔让他一想到要和欧文斯小姐结婚，就好像“爱尔兰人上绞架”一般。

因此他给欧文斯小姐写了一封信，坦诚而有技巧地告诉了她自己的感受，并试图解除婚约。

这里有一封林肯于一八三七年五月七日在春田市写的信。通过这封信，我们大致可以推算出他曾在信中和玛丽·托德说了什么。

玛丽(7)吾友：

在写这封信之前，我已经写了两次，但每次还没写到一半就让我撕了，因为我不满意。第一次我自己不够严肃，第二次却又太严肃了。现在写的这封信，不管写得如何，我都会寄出。

春田市的生活实在太无趣了——至少对我来说如此。我在这里很孤独，和我在其他地方一样孤独。我来到这里后，只有一个女人和我说过话。如果她当时可以避开，她是不会和我说话的。我还没去过教堂，大概以后也不会去，因为我很清楚，到了那样的地方，我一定会手足无措。我经常想起我们曾约好，让你来春田市生活，但恐怕你不会喜欢这里。这里车水马龙，十分繁华，然而如果你发现自己无法成为那份繁华的一部分，我想这对你来说，会如同末日般痛苦。甚至你还会贫穷得连掩饰贫穷的手段都没有。你觉得自己可以耐心地忍受这种生活吗？若有女子愿意与我共度一生，不管她是什么样的女子，我都愿意尽我所能让她幸福满足。我无法想象还有什么事能比做不到这一点更让我痛苦。我知道如果能与你在一起，我一定比现在幸福，但前提是，你也满意将来的生活。

你对我说的那些话，也许是开玩笑，也许是我误解了。如果是这样，那就让我们忘了那些话吧。如果不是，我希望你能慎重考虑。对我来说，我已做出了决定。如果你愿意，我一定会遵守之前的承诺，但我的建议是你最好不要来，你未曾适应艰辛的日子，而这里的生活，只会比你想象的更辛苦。我知道你在任何事上都能做出正确的判断，如果你在决定前能仔细地考虑，那么我一定按你的意愿行事。

读过这封信后，请务必给我回一封长信，反正你也没什么其他事可做。虽然对你来说，也许写了信后也只会觉得兴趣索然，但对我来说，在这忙碌的荒郊，读信也是一种很好的陪伴。另外，请转告令姐，别再提把房子卖掉然后搬家的事了，一想到这件事我就心烦。

你真诚的朋友

林肯

林肯与欧文斯小姐的故事就是如此。我们回到他和玛丽·托德的故事。斯皮德将林肯写给托德小姐的信扔进火堆后，转身对他的室友说：

“如果你还有点儿男子汉该有的气概，那就亲自去见玛丽。如果你真的不爱她，就告诉她真相，告诉她你不愿和她结婚。注意别说太多，说完后尽快离开。”

“我劝说了他一番后，”斯皮德回忆道，“他便扣上大衣扣子，神情坚决地按照我给他的明确指示去完成这项严肃的任务了。”

赫恩登说：

那天晚上，斯皮德没有和我们一起上楼睡觉。他借口想要看会儿书，在楼下的店铺里等着林肯回来。十点多了，林肯和托德小姐的谈话还没结束。终于，十一点多的时候，林肯悄悄地走了进来。根据他在托德小姐处逗留的时间，斯皮德早已猜到他并未按照自己的指示行事。

“兄弟，你之前信誓旦旦地说会照我说的做，结果怎么样？”斯皮德劈头问道。

“我照你说的做了，”林肯若有所思地说，“当我告诉她，我并不爱她的时候，她放声大哭，从椅子上跳了起来，双手扭作一团，似乎非常痛苦，还说了些骗子自己反倒被骗了之类的话。”然后林肯便不说话了。

“你还对她说了些什么？”斯皮德一边问一边在心里推测林肯这番话的意思。

“说实话，斯皮德，这对我来说太难了。我的脸上不知不觉间溢满了泪水，我一把抱住她，吻了她。”

“你就是这样解除婚姻的？”斯皮德嘲笑道，“你不仅做了一回蠢货，你的行为等同于再次确定了你们的婚约，从道德上讲，你现在已经不能回头了。”

“哎，”林肯慢吞吞地说，“如果我又陷了进去，那就这样吧。木已成舟，我能忍受。”

几个星期过去了，结婚的日子越来越近了。女裁缝赶制着玛丽·托德的嫁衣，爱德华府也修葺一新：墙面重新粉刷，客厅重新装饰，地毯也换了，家具重新布置、抛光。

然而与此同时，林肯身上正发生着一件很可怕的事。林肯的这种变化很难用语言来描述。抑郁可不是普通的悲伤情绪，它是一种危险的疾病，对身心都有很大的危害。

林肯一天天地沉沦着，不断地接近抑郁。他的精神几近崩溃。后来他是否真的从这几周无法言说的折磨中恢复过来，也很难说。虽然他同意了结婚，但他整个灵魂都是拒绝的。他并未意识到这一点，只是一直在寻找逃避的办法。他在杂货店楼上的房间里一坐便是几个小时，一点儿也不愿意去办公室或者参加议会会议。有时他在凌晨三点醒来，下楼点燃壁炉，坐在那里盯着炉火直至天亮。他吃得越来越少，逐渐消瘦。他变得易怒，不愿见人，也不愿和人说话。

随着婚礼的临近，他内心充满恐惧，开始畏缩起来。他就像坠入了黑暗的深渊般无法自拔。他害怕自己会丧失理智，于是写了一封信给辛辛那提大学医学部杰出的领军人物丹尼尔·德雷克（Daniel Drake）医生。在信中林肯描述了自己的情况，希望医生能推荐一种治疗方式。但德雷克医生回复说，如果不亲自检查，他没法给出治疗建议。

婚礼定在一八四一年一月一日。那一天，天朗气清，春田市的贵族们乘坐着雪橇四处拜年，场面好不热闹。马儿的鼻孔里呼出了白色的热气，空气中回荡着铃儿叮叮当当的响声。

在爱德华府，所有人都在忙乱而迅速地做着婚礼最后的准备。送货的孩子抱着最后一刻才定的这样那样的物品，急急忙忙赶到后门。为了这次宴席，他们还特别聘请了一名大厨。原本架在壁炉床上的旧铁灶也不用了，他们特意搭了一座新式厨灶来准备晚宴。

新年的夜晚来了，烛火温柔地摇曳着，窗上挂着神圣的花环。爱德华一家激动得凝神屏息，快活地期待着婚礼的到来。六点半后，心情愉悦的客人们陆续到场。六点四十五分，牧师来了，胳膊底下夹着《圣经》。房间里堆满了争奇斗艳的各色花卉。壁炉里的火焰哔剥作响，火光通红。屋子里回荡着愉快、友好的交谈声。

钟敲了七下……七点三十分。林肯还没有来……他迟到了。

时间缓缓地、无情地流逝着。走廊上古老的大钟滴答作响地走着，又过了一刻钟，又过了半个小时……新郎仍未出现。爱德华太太站在门口，紧张地盯着车道。到底怎么回事？他是不是……不！绝不可能！

全家人退到一旁，小声嘟囔着——他们开了一个紧急会议。

在隔壁房间里，玛丽·托德戴着新娘头纱，身着丝质长裙，一边等待着，一边焦急地摩挲着头发上的鲜花。她时不时走到窗边，凝视着下方的街道。她的双眼死死地盯着钟。她的掌心沁出汗来，额头上也布满了汗珠。又过了可怕的一个小时。他可是承诺过的啊……

九点半的时候，客人们带着疑惑和尴尬悄悄地陆续离开了。

当最后一位客人离开后，准新娘一把扯下头纱，拔下头上的插花，呜咽着冲上楼去，扑倒在床上，悲伤得不能自已。上帝啊！人们会怎么议论？她会被人嘲笑，被人怜悯，丢尽脸面。她再也没脸走在大街上了。强烈的苦涩感和愤怒席卷了她的全身。此刻，她一会儿希望林肯能在身边将她搂入怀中，一会儿又恨不得因为林肯带给她的伤害和耻辱而杀了他。

林肯去哪里了呢？他被人杀害了吗？他遇到事故了吗？他逃跑了吗？他自杀了吗？没有人知道。

午夜的时候，人们提着灯到处寻找林肯。一部分人去市里他常去的地方寻找，剩余的人则沿着通往乡间的路寻觅。





8


搜索人员找了一整夜，终于在破晓后不久找到了林肯。当时他正坐在自己的办公室里语无伦次地念念有词。他的朋友们害怕他疯了。玛丽·托德的亲属对外宣称林肯疯了，所以才没在婚礼上出现。

很快，亨利医生来了。林肯总是说想要自杀，因此医生要求斯皮德和巴特勒看着他。他的便刀也被拿走了，就像安·拉特利奇刚去世那会儿一样。

亨利医生希望林肯的注意力能转移到其他地方去，于是敦促林肯经常参加州议会的会议。作为辉格党的政党领导人，林肯理应经常出席会议，但记录表明，他在三周内只去了四次，每次都只有一两个小时。一月十九日，约翰·J.哈丁（John J. Hardin）向议会宣布林肯的病情。

逃婚三周后的某一天，林肯给他的法律合伙人写了一封一生中最悲伤的信：

我现在是所有活着的人中最悲惨的那个。如果把我内心的悲伤平分给世上的每个人，那么这世上便不会再有一张笑脸。我也不知道自己能否再好起来，但我预感会很糟——我恐怕不会好起来了。我再也不可能像以前那样了。在我看来，我必须死了才会好。

正如威廉·E.巴顿博士（William E. Barton）后来在他著名的林肯传记中所说，这封信“充分表现出林肯内心焦虑不安……他非常担心自己神智不清”。

现在，他经常想到死亡，也渴望死亡，还写了一首关于自杀的诗，发表在《桑加蒙日报》上。

斯皮德担心林肯会寻死，于是把林肯送到了自己母亲那里休养。斯皮德的母亲住在路易维尔市附近，她为林肯准备了一本《圣经》和一间安静的卧室。卧室正对着一条小溪，小溪缓缓地流淌过一片牧场，流入一英里外的森林中。每天早晨都有一位黑奴将咖啡送到他的床边。

玛丽的姐姐爱德华夫人说，玛丽“为了让自己好受些，也为了缓解林肯先生的精神压力，给林肯先生写了一封长信，信中表明她愿意将林肯从婚约的束缚中解放出来”。

不过爱德华夫人也表示，玛丽虽然解除了婚约，但“如果林肯愿意恢复婚约，她也给他这个权利”。但对林肯而言，让他恢复婚约是根本不可能的事。他再也不想见到玛丽，甚至逃婚事件过去一年之后，林肯的好友詹姆斯·马西尼（James Matheny）仍旧“认为林肯会自杀”。

“灾难性的一月一日”过去近两年后，林肯已彻底不在意玛丽·托德，他只希望玛丽能够忘记他，祈祷着她能够再看上其他男人。但玛丽可没忘记林肯，她的骄傲和强烈的自尊不允许她放下。她已下定决心，向自己以及那些嘲讽、可怜过她的人证明，她能够并且一定会嫁给亚伯拉罕·林肯。

而林肯也下定决心，绝不会娶她为妻。

事实上，林肯的决心非常坚定，逃婚后不到一年，他就向另外一个女孩求了婚。当时林肯已经三十二岁，那女孩只有十六岁。女孩名叫萨拉·理查德（Sarah Rickard），是巴特勒太太的小妹妹。林肯曾在巴特勒家寄宿了四年。

林肯是这样为这段感情正名的：他的名字是亚伯拉罕，而她的名字是萨拉，很明显，他们注定是一对。(8)

但是那姑娘拒绝了林肯。后来她在写给朋友的一封信中这样解释道：

我只有十六岁，还很年轻，对于婚姻，还没想太多……我只是把林肯当作朋友，你也知道，他那奇怪的举止和仪态对于一个渴望融入社会的女孩来说，是没什么吸引力的……他就好像我姐姐家的一位兄长。

林肯经常给当地的辉格党党报《春田市日报》写社评。他和报纸编辑西米恩·弗朗西斯（Simeon Francis）是挚友。不幸的是，弗朗西斯的太太实在是太爱管闲事了。她已年过四十，膝下无子，是春田市最能自作主张的媒婆。

一八四二年十月初的一天，她写信给林肯，让他第二天下午去一趟她家。这是一个非常奇怪的邀请，虽然不知道弗朗西斯太太有何用意，但林肯还是去了。他一到弗朗西斯家，便被引入了客厅。进入客厅后，他大吃了一惊——坐在他面前的，竟然是玛丽·托德。

我们不知道林肯和玛丽·托德以何种方式说了什么，又或者做了什么，但可以肯定的是，这个可怜的软心肠的家伙，这次没能逃脱。如果玛丽哭了——她肯定会哭——按照林肯的脾气，他很可能会立刻缴械投降，悲惨地为自己曾经的逃离向她道歉。

自那以后，他们经常在弗朗西斯家见面，但都是秘密地躲在房门紧闭的屋子里。

一开始，她和林肯重修旧好的事，玛丽连自己的姐姐都没有告知。

终于，她的姐姐发现了，她问玛丽：“你为什么弄得那么神秘？”

玛丽回答道：“发生了之前的事后，这段恋情最好还是不要急着公布于众。这世上的男男女女都靠不住，存在很多变数，如果厄运再次降临在我们的婚约上，那还是不要让大家知道的好。”

说白了，经过了上次的事后，玛丽这次学乖了。她决定在自己十分确定林肯会和她结婚前，不对外公布她和林肯的事。

这一次，托德小姐又用了什么伎俩呢？

詹姆斯·马西尼表示，林肯经常告诉他“自己是被迫结婚的，因为玛丽·托德小姐说，从道义上讲，他必须娶她”。

赫恩登应该比任何人都了解内情。他说：

在我看来，事实再清楚不过了，林肯先生与玛丽·托德结婚，完全是出于道义。但这样一来，他牺牲了自己内心的宁静。他曾深刻地自我剖析过，得出的结论是自己并不爱她，但自己已经答应和她结婚。这种隐藏的想法像噩梦般浮现在他的脑海中……最终，他不得不直面道义和内心的宁静之间的冲突。他选择了前者，代价便是数年的自我折磨和牺牲的痛苦，以及永远失去了一个幸福的家庭。

在他跨出最后那一步之前，他写信给已回到肯塔基州的斯皮德，问他是否在婚姻中找到了幸福。

“请快些回信，”林肯恳求道，“我急切地想知道。”

斯皮德回复说自己的婚姻生活比预期的还要幸福。

于是第二天下午，也就是一八四二年十一月四日，星期五，林肯带着心痛不情不愿地向玛丽·托德求了婚。

她恨不得当晚就举行婚礼。林肯没想到事情进展得这么快，对此，他犹豫了，又有些害怕。他深知玛丽很迷信，于是托词十一月四日是周五，不吉利。经过了之前的退婚事件后，玛丽现在最怕的便是拖延，她甚至连二十四小时也不愿等。更何况，当天是她二十四岁生日，于是他们赶到了查特顿的珠宝店，买了一枚婚戒，内圈刻着一行字：爱是永恒。

那天傍晚，林肯邀请詹姆斯·马西尼做他的伴郎。他说：“吉姆，我不得不和那个女孩结婚。”

那天晚上，在巴特勒家，林肯穿上了他最好的衣服，还给靴子擦了黑色鞋油。巴特勒的小儿子跑了过来，问他准备去哪里。

林肯说：“去地狱吧，我想。”

当初玛丽由于绝望将第一次婚礼的礼服全扔了，因此现在她只能穿上一条简单的白色薄纱长裙出席仪式。一切都很仓促。

爱德华夫人说，婚礼前两个小时，她才得到消息，以至于她烤制的结婚蛋糕端上来时，上面的糖霜还是热的，根本没法切。

查尔斯·德莱赛（Charles Dresser）牧师身着牧师礼服，读着令人印象深刻的圣公会赞美诗，但林肯似乎一点儿也不激动、一点儿也不快乐。他的伴郎后来证实：“他的神情和行为，就像马上要被屠宰一样。”

对于自己的婚姻，林肯只做过一次书面评论。在婚礼结束一周后，他给塞缪尔·马歇尔（Samuel Marshall）写了一封业务信，他在信的附笔中提到了自己的婚姻。这封信如今保存在芝加哥历史社团。

“这里没什么新鲜事，”林肯写道，“唯一的新鲜事是我结婚了。对我来说，结婚是一件非常奇怪的事。”

当我在伊利诺伊州的新塞勒姆村写这本书的时候，我在当地的律师好友亨利·庞德（Henry Pond）屡次对我说：“你应该去见一见吉米·麦尔斯（Jimmy Miles）叔叔，他的舅舅赫恩登是林肯律师事务所的合伙人，他的姑妈曾经营一家旅馆，林肯夫妇在那里住过一段时间。”

这条线索听起来挺有意思，于是七月的某个周日下午，我和庞德先生钻进他的汽车，驶向新塞勒姆村附近的麦尔斯农场。当初林肯在步行去春田市借阅法律书籍的途中，常在这里歇脚，并用那些有趣的故事换一杯苹果酒。

我们到达那里的时候，吉米叔叔拖了三把摇椅出来，放在前院枫树的树荫下。小火鸡和小鸭子吵吵闹闹地穿梭在我们周围的草地里。我们聊了好几个小时。吉米叔叔讲起了一件关于林肯的发人深省而又悲伤的小事。这件事并未记录在之前的任何文字中。故事是这样的：

麦尔斯的姑妈凯瑟琳嫁给了一位名叫雅各布·俄利（Jacob M.Early）的内科医生。林肯到春田市一年后的某个晚上——具体来说是一八三八年三月十一日的晚上——一个陌生男子骑着马来到俄利医生家门口，敲了敲门。待医生开门后，这位男子将猎枪里的两管子弹全都射向了医生，然后跃上马，匆忙逃走了。

当时的春田市虽然很小，但却没人为这起谋杀案负责，而凶手至今仍逍遥法外。

俄利医生只留下了一栋小房子，因此他的遗孀不得不将房子租出去，以维持生计。林肯夫妇结婚后不久，便住到了俄利夫人家中。

吉米叔叔说，他的姑妈，也就是俄利医生的遗孀，常常和他说起这样一件事：

一天早上，林肯夫妇正在用早餐，林肯先生不知道做了什么，惹得他那脾气暴躁的妻子大发雷霆。林肯夫人一怒之下，当着其他租客的面，将一杯热咖啡泼到了她丈夫的脸上。林肯什么都没说。俄利太太拿来了一条湿毛巾，擦去他脸上和衣服上的污渍。在这个过程中，林肯什么都没说，只是屈辱地坐着，一言不发。

从这件小事也许能看出林肯在接下来二十几年的婚姻中度过了怎样的日子。

春田市有十一位律师，但单靠春田市的业务，他们并不能养家糊口。当时，大卫·戴维斯（David Davis）法官在第八司法辖区内有流动法庭上的业务，于是这些律师骑上马，跟着戴维斯法官奔波在各县之间。其他律师在周六的时候都会设法赶回春田市和家人共度周末。

但林肯却不是这样。他害怕回家。每年春天和秋天，他都会各花三个月在外巡回办案，连春田市附近的区域都不去。

一年又一年，他一直都是如此。乡村旅馆的条件很差，但即便如此，他还是宁愿住在乡村旅馆，也不愿回家面对他的妻子无休止的唠叨和动不动就爆发的坏脾气。邻居们说玛丽“能把林肯折磨得灵魂出窍”。邻居们之所以这么说，是因为亲眼看到了玛丽的所作所为。对于她的喊叫，他们也觉得无法忍受。

参议员贝弗里奇说：“林肯夫人那尖锐的大嗓门，隔着一条街都能听到。她不停地发脾气，住在她家附近的人都能听到。她的怒火经常通过语言之外的其他方式发泄。关于她的暴行的那些传言，都是真实的，而且数不胜数。”

“她给她的丈夫带来了许多痛苦和没必要的麻烦。”赫恩登说。

赫恩登认为他了解玛丽为何“释放了自己失意而暴虐的本性”。

因为她要复仇。“他粉碎了她身为贵族女子的高傲，”赫恩登推测道，“她觉得自己掉了身价，于是仇恨来临时爱情逃离了。”

她总是在抱怨，总是挑剔自己的丈夫。在她眼里，林肯没有一处是好的：驼背，走路姿势奇怪，抬脚时两只脚直上直下，像个印第安人。她抱怨林肯步伐中没有一点儿活力，走起路来毫无优雅可言。她模仿他的步伐，总是向他唠叨走路时脚趾要朝下，就像曼特尔夫人教她的那样。

她也不喜欢林肯那对和头部呈直角的招风耳，她还对林肯说，他的鼻子不直，他的下嘴唇突出，他看起来像肺痨患者，他的手太大了，头太小了。

林肯对自己的外表毫不在乎，这刺激着玛丽敏感的神经，令她极度不高兴。赫恩登说：“林肯夫人的怒火也并非毫无理由。”有的时候，她的丈夫走在街上，一只裤腿塞在靴筒里，另一只裤腿垂在靴子外面。他几乎不擦靴子，也不给靴子擦油，他的衬领脏兮兮的，他的外套也需要清洗。

林肯多年的老邻居詹姆斯·高莱（James Gourly）这样写道：“林肯先生常常来我家玩，他总是穿着一双松大的拖鞋，一条洗褪色的裤子，裤子上只系了一条吊裤带。”林肯称它为“单带裤”。

天气暖和的时候，他会进行长途旅行，“穿一件脏兮兮的亚麻防尘衣当作外套，背后满是汗渍，看上去就像一幅大陆地图”。

一位年轻的律师曾在乡村旅馆中见过林肯，当时林肯正准备睡觉，“穿着一件自制的、长度在膝盖和脚踝之间的黄色法兰绒睡衣”。那位年轻律师这样评价林肯：“他是我见过的最荒唐的人。”

他一辈子都没有自己的刮胡刀，也不像玛丽要求的那样经常去理发店。

他一点儿也不在意自己那一头粗糙浓密的头发，任它们乱七八糟地竖在头上，就像马的鬃毛。对此，玛丽怒不可遏，而且每次给林肯梳好头发后，没过多久，又会变得乱糟糟的——林肯总是喜欢把钱、信和法律文书放在帽子里。

有一天，他在芝加哥请人为他画一幅肖像。画家让他“打扮得漂亮些”，他回答道：“春田市的人可认不出打扮得漂亮些的林肯画像。”

他的餐桌礼仪也自由得很。他握叉的方式不对，叉子放在盘中的方式也不对。他更是一点儿也不懂利用刀叉和面包皮优雅地享用鱼头的乐趣。有的时候，他直接拿过盛肉的大浅盘，将里面的肉排倒在自己的盘子里。他总是用自己的刀去切黄油，为此，林肯夫人没少和他争吵。有一次，看到林肯直接把吃完的鸡骨头放在了盛生菜的副菜盘上，玛丽气得差点儿晕厥。

有女士来访时，林肯既不站起来，也不帮她们拿大衣。客人离开时，他也不送客。玛丽因此满腹牢骚，总是责骂林肯。

林肯喜欢躺着看书。每次他一从办公室回来，就立刻脱掉外套、鞋子、衬领和吊裤带，把过道里的椅子翻个身，在椅背上垫个枕头，头和肩膀靠着枕头，半躺在地上看起书来。

林肯能用这种姿势一连阅读好几个小时。他阅读的通常都是报纸，有时也会看些他认为非常幽默的故事，例如《阿拉巴马的全盛时代》中关于地震的故事。他还经常阅读诗歌。不管阅读的内容是什么，他都要大声地念出声来。这是他在印第安纳州那所“大声朗读”学校养成的习惯。此外，他还认为大声朗读可以通过视觉和听觉同时强化记忆，从而达到长久记忆的效果。

有的时候，他半躺在地上，闭着眼睛，背诵莎士比亚、拜伦或者爱伦·坡的诗句，例如：

月亮的每一丝清辉都勾起我的回忆，

梦里那美丽的安娜贝尔·李；

繁星的每一次升起都令我觉得秋波在闪动，

那是我美丽的安娜贝尔·李。

有一位女士是林肯的亲戚，她与林肯一家同住了两年。她说，有一天晚上，林肯正半躺在走廊里看书，这时来了几位客人，没等用人应门，他便站了起来，穿了件衬衫就将客人引入了客厅，他说他要“好好地向女士们展示一番”。

林肯夫人在隔壁屋里看到了女士们来访，也听到了自己丈夫诙谐的话语，她顿时暴跳如雷，让林肯十分尴尬。因此林肯明智地离开了家，直到夜深人静时才悄悄地从后门溜进家中。

林肯夫人嫉妒心非常强，而且她很不喜欢约书亚·斯皮德，因为斯皮德是她丈夫的挚友，而她怀疑斯皮德曾教唆林肯逃婚。在结婚前，林肯给斯皮德写信时，总会在结尾习惯性地加上一句“把我的爱转告给芬妮”。但结婚后，林肯夫人要求林肯将这句话改成“向斯皮德太太问好”。

林肯从不忘记别人对自己的恩惠，这也是他一个突出的特点。因此，出于对斯皮德的感激，他曾承诺将他的第一个孩子取名为约书亚·斯皮德·林肯。玛丽·托德知道这件事后大发雷霆。这是她的孩子！应该由她来取名！而且，怎么能叫约书亚·斯皮德？应该以她父亲罗伯特·托德的名字命名……

不用说，这个孩子最后的名字是罗伯特·托德。他是林肯四个儿子中唯一长大成人的孩子。艾迪（Eddie）在一八五〇年死于春田市，年仅四岁。威利（Willie）死在白宫，年仅十二岁。

泰德（Tad）在一八七一年死于芝加哥，年仅十八岁。罗伯特·托德·林肯于一九二六年七月二十六日死于佛蒙特州的曼彻斯特市，享年八十三岁。

林肯夫人总是抱怨院子里没有鲜花和灌木丛，没有一点儿色彩，于是林肯在院子里种了几株玫瑰，但他的心思完全不在它们身上。没过多久，那些花儿便因无人照顾而枯萎了。林肯夫人要求林肯开辟一片花园，在某个春天，林肯真的做到了，但花园很快就变得杂草丛生。

尽管林肯不大喜欢体力活儿，但却亲自喂养、梳刷自己的爱驹“老公鹿”。他也“亲自喂牛，给牛挤奶，给牛割草料”。即便在他当选总统之后，他还坚持做这些事，直到后来离开了春田市。

林肯的第二个表兄约翰·汉克斯（John Hanks）曾说：“除了做梦，亚伯什么都不擅长。”对此，玛丽·林肯深表赞同。

林肯经常走神，总是处于一种古怪的冥想之中，似乎忘记了周遭的一切人和事。星期天的时候，他会将自己的婴孩放在小车里，拉着小车在门口那条崎岖不平的人行道上来来回回地走。有的时候，孩子被颠了出去，但林肯仍旧拉着车平稳地向前走着。他双眼凝视着地面，根本没听到身后孩子撕心裂肺的哭声，直到林肯夫人从门口探出头来，生气地朝他喊叫时，他才意识到发生了什么事。

有的时候，结束了一天的工作从办公室回到家中后，林肯会一言不发地对着他的夫人发呆。林肯对食物也没什么兴趣。她做好晚饭后，总是千呼万唤，才能将林肯请进餐厅。吃饭的时候，她喊了林肯一声，但他似乎并未听见。他坐在桌边，做梦似的盯着前方。直到玛丽提醒他，他才想起来吃饭这件事。

吃过晚饭，他有时会一言不发地凝视壁炉半个小时。孩子们爬到他的身上，揪他的头发，和他说话，但他似乎并未意识到孩子们的存在。然后他好像突然醒了过来，于是便讲一个笑话或者背诵几句最爱的诗句：

人啊，你有什么值得骄傲的呢？

如飞逝的流星，如奔腾的流云，

如易逝的闪电，如退去的浪花，

生命匆匆，墓中长眠才是永恒。

林肯夫人责备林肯从不纠正孩子的错误，说他太爱孩子，“根本看不到孩子们的缺点。”林肯夫人说：“只要孩子们做了好事，他总是大方地表扬他们。他还说，‘我很开心能看到孩子们自由快乐，不受制于父母的专制。一旦将孩子们绑在父母身边，爱便成了枷锁。’”

有时，他给孩子们的自由是非常惊人的。有一次，他正在和一位最高法院的法官下棋，罗伯特走了进来，告诉他的父亲吃晚饭的时间到了。林肯嘴上说着“好的，好的”，却一心沉醉在棋局中，完全忘记了这件事。

过了一会儿，小男孩又走了进来，又替林肯夫人喊了他一遍。林肯答应他马上就来，但又忘记了。

罗伯特又喊了林肯一次。这一次，林肯仍旧满口答应，却继续下着棋。突然间，男孩回过身来，一脚踢飞了棋盘。棋盘越过了两位棋手的头顶，棋子洒落得到处都是。

“好了，法官大人，”林肯微笑着说，“我想我们得改天再下完这盘棋了。”

很显然，林肯根本没想过要管教自己的儿子。

林肯家的男孩们常在晚上的时候躲在篱笆后面，把一根木条伸到篱笆外面。当时没有路灯，因此等路人被木条绊倒后，孩子们就趁机偷走他们的帽子。有一次，孩子们在黑暗中误偷了自己父亲的帽子。林肯没有责备他们，而是告诉他们要小心些，因为他们这样可是会把路人气疯的。

林肯不属于任何教会，也避免谈论宗教话题，即便和最好的朋友在一起时也是如此。不过，他曾对赫恩登说，他的宗教信条和印第安纳州的一个名叫葛伦的老头相似。他曾听那位老人说过这样一句话：“当我做好事时，我觉得快乐。当我做坏事时，我觉得很糟。这就是我的信仰。”

待孩子们长大些后，每到周日上午，他便会带着孩子们出门散步。有一次，他将孩子们留在了家中，与林肯夫人一起去了第一长老教会教堂。半个小时后，泰德走进屋子，发现父亲不在，于是顺着大街一路跑向教堂，闯进了正在布道的会场。他头发零乱，鞋子没系好，袜子下垂着，脸上和手上满是伊利诺伊州的黑泥土。打扮得十分优雅的林肯夫人吓了一跳，觉得非常尴尬，但林肯镇定地伸出手臂，充满怜爱地将泰德拉到自己身边，将他的小脑袋埋在了自己胸口。

有的时候，他会在周日上午带孩子们去他的办公室。林肯允许他们在那里撒野。“他们很快就毁了架子上的书，”赫恩登说，“他们翻箱倒柜，弄坏了我的金笔的笔头……他们把铅笔扔到了痰盂里，把墨水瓶倒过来放在文件上，把信件扔得到处都是，踩着满地的信纸跳舞。”

“林肯从未责备过他们，也不曾像其他父亲一样对他们皱眉头。他是我认识的最纵容孩子的父母。”赫恩登总结道。

林肯夫人很少去林肯的办公室，但她去了之后，大吃一惊：办公室里毫无秩序可言，东西堆得到处都是，一切都乱七八糟。林肯将一些文件捆在了一起，并给它们贴上了标签：“如果在其他地方找不到，就到这里找找试试。”

正如斯皮德所说，在林肯的生活中，“毫无规律才是规律。”

办公室的一面墙上隐隐约约有一块很大的黑色污渍——这是一个学法律的学生向另一个学生的脑袋扔墨水瓶却没扔中后留下的印记。

办公室几乎不打扫，也没消过毒。书架顶部积了一层厚厚的尘土，原本落在那里的种子，已然发芽生长起来。

在生活的许多方面，春田市没有比玛丽·林肯更勤俭持家的主妇了。但在那些可以炫耀的事情上，她却尤为奢侈。她买了一辆林肯家根本承受不起的马车，还以一下午二十五美分的价格雇了邻居家的小男孩做车夫，拉着她去镇里走亲访友。春田市本就是个小地方，她完全可以步行或雇一辆车。但是她不能这么做，太失身份。而且，不管他们多穷，她总是能凑出钱来买那些远不是他们能消费得起的衣服。

一八四四年，林肯一家以一千五百美元的价格买下了两年前为他们主持婚礼的查尔斯·德莱赛牧师的房子。这栋房子内设起居室、厨房、会客室和几间卧室。院子后面有一堆木柴、一个厕所，还有一个可以让林肯饲养奶牛和“老公鹿”的马厩。

一开始，这个地方在玛丽·林肯眼中就像天堂一样。事实上，和他们刚刚搬离的那个阴冷、简陋的寄宿公寓比起来，这里确实算是天堂。此外，这栋房子是她的，这种拥有感让她感到非常快乐和骄傲。不久之后，房子的完美感开始褪去，她开始无休止地抱怨起房子的毛病来。她的姐姐住着两层楼的大房子，这栋房子却只有一层半高。她告诉林肯，没有哪个了不起的人物是住在一层半高的矮房里的。

通常来说，当她要什么东西时，林肯从来都不会询问是否有必要。“你知道自己要什么，”他总是说，“去买就是了。”但这一次，他却很反对。家里本就人少，这栋房子已经足够了。更何况，他很穷，刚结婚的时候，他只有五百美金，到了现在也没增加多少存款。他知道他们没有钱扩建房子，对此她也很清楚，但仍旧不断地提要求，不停地唠叨。最后，为了让她闭嘴，林肯找了一个承包商估算价格，并让承包商把价格估高一些。承包商照做了，林肯将预算拿给玛丽看。看到那些数字，她倒吸了一口气。林肯以为，这件事就这么解决了。

但是林肯太天真了。第二天，待他外出巡回办案时，玛丽请来了一个木匠。她得到了一个低一些的报价，便立刻敲定了这项工程。

待到林肯回到春田市，走入第八大街的时候，他差点儿没认出自己家来。他遇到了一位朋友，故意装出一副严肃的样子问道：“陌生人，你能告诉我林肯先生住在哪里吗？”

林肯做律师的收入本就不高，用他自己的话说，为了付清账单，他不得不“东拼西凑”。如今他一回到家，身上又多了一张数目庞大但毫无必要的装修账单。

他说，他感到非常悲伤。

面对林肯的指责，林肯夫人只会用一种方式应对——言语攻击。她愤怒地指责林肯没有金钱观念，根本不知道如何经营，还说他向当事人收取的费用太低。

对于最后一点，林肯夫人尤为不满，而许多人和她的想法是一样的。林肯总是收取微薄的律师费，这让其他律师非常不悦，他们抱怨说林肯让整个律师界都变穷了。

一八五三年的时候，林肯四十四岁，距他入主白宫还有八年时间。这一年他在麦克林巡回法庭办了四件案子，总共只收了三十美金。

他说，他的很多当事人和他一样穷，他不忍心收取高额的律师费。

有一次，一个人给了他二十五美金律师费，他还回去十美金，还说当事人太慷慨了。

还有一次，他帮助一位精神错乱的姑娘从骗子手里要回了价值一万美金的财物。林肯只花了十五分钟便赢了官司。一个小时之后，他的助手沃德·拉蒙（Ward Lamon）来和他平分二百五十美金的酬劳，但林肯却严厉地制止了他。拉蒙说这是事先就定好的价钱，女孩的哥哥十分愿意支付这笔费用。

“也许吧，”林肯反驳道，“但是我不愿意。我宁愿饿死，也不愿意用这种方式从那个又穷又疯的可怜姑娘手里骗走这么多钱。你至少还一半回去，否则我分文不收。”

还有一起官司。一个革命老兵的遗孀领了四百美金的养老金，她的养老金代理人仅仅在她口头允许的情况下擅自取走了两百美金。那位遗孀年事已高，腰背弯曲，日子过得很清苦。林肯让她起诉了代理人，帮她赢了官司，但分文未收。此外，林肯还支付了她住店的旅费和回程的车票。

一天，寡妇阿姆斯特朗遇到了大麻烦，于是来找林肯。她的儿子达夫被指控在一次酒后闹事中杀了人，她恳求林肯救救她的儿子。林肯早在新塞勒姆村的时候就认识了阿姆斯特朗一家，达夫在摇篮里的时候，林肯还哄过他睡觉呢。阿姆斯特朗一家野蛮好斗，但林肯很喜欢他们。达夫的父亲杰克·阿姆斯特朗曾是“闪耀的丛林男孩”的领袖，也是著名的摔跤好手，在一次摔跤比赛中曾被林肯击败过。这件事是有历史记载的。

老杰克现在已经不在了，因此林肯很乐意帮忙。他站在陪审团面前，进行了他律师生涯中最令人动容的辩护，将故人之子从绞架下救了出来。

这位寡母想将自己在这个世界上的全部财产——四十英亩土地——送给林肯做报酬。

“汉娜婶婶，”林肯说，“数年前我一贫如洗又无家可归的时候，是你将我带回了家，给我饭吃，替我补衣服。我现在绝不能收你的钱。”

有的时候，他会劝当事人庭外和解，也不收他们的咨询费。有一次，他拒绝接受法庭对一个人的判决，他说：“这个人又穷又瘸，我很同情他。”

林肯的善良和怜悯之心，虽然很美好，但却挣不到钱，于是玛丽·林肯总是烦躁地责备他。她的丈夫还未出人头地，而其他律师都靠着佣金和投资日益富裕起来，例如大卫·戴维斯法官，还有洛根，当然，还有史蒂芬·道格拉斯。道格拉斯在芝加哥投资了房地产，现在已经积累了不少财富。他甚至还成了慈善家，给芝加哥大学捐了十英亩的珍贵土地用于建造大楼。而且，他现在是全国最著名的政治领袖。

玛丽·林肯总是惦记着他——如果当初和他结婚那该多好！作为道格拉斯的夫人，她便可以成为华盛顿社交圈的领导人物，穿着巴黎的衣服，去欧洲旅行，和女王一起吃饭，然后某天入住白宫。大概她每天都在这些白日梦里描绘着这些画面。

作为林肯的妻子，她有什么未来？林肯也许到死都是这样了：每年花六个月时间在外面巡回办案，留自己在家独守空房，不爱她，也不关注她……现实生活和多年前她在曼特尔夫人的学校里幻想的浪漫情景完全不同，而这种不同又是多么令人心酸啊！

据说，大多数情况下，林肯夫人是十分节俭的，并以此为傲。她采购日常所需时总是十分谨慎，他们家餐桌上的食物也少得可怜，残羹剩饭也就只够小猫舔上一两口，因此林肯家当然也不养狗。

但林肯夫人却一瓶接一瓶地买香水，拆开封口试一试，再退回去，还强词夺理地说这些香水是次品，与店家的描述不符。她经常退货，最后弄得当地的药房老板不愿再接受她的订单。那本用铅笔标注着“林肯夫人退回的香水”的账本，现在也许还在春田市。

林肯夫人频繁和商贩们闹矛盾。例如，她认为卖冰的迈尔斯缺斤少两，于是对着迈尔斯大发脾气，大声地训斥他。她的声音十分尖，穿透力十足，弄得半个街区的街坊纷纷跑到自家门口看热闹。

这已是迈尔斯第二次受到林肯夫人的斥责了，于是他发誓，哪怕她热得浑身咝咝冒烟，也决不再卖一块冰给她。

他说到做到，不再给林肯夫人送货。事情一下子变得尴尬起来。她需要冰块，而迈尔斯是镇上唯一提供冰块的商贩，于是玛丽·林肯第一次放低了姿态。但她并未亲自道歉，而是花了二十五美分请邻居替她去了一趟市中心，安抚哄劝迈尔斯继续卖冰给她。

林肯的一位朋友办了一份名叫《春田市共和党人》的报纸，并在市里四处宣传。林肯订了一份。可是当第一份报纸送到林肯家的时候，玛丽·托德勃然大怒。什么？又是一份没用的报纸？她在拼了命地省钱，他却把钱往外扔！玛丽如演讲般地咒骂着。为了平息她的怒火，林肯说他并没有让他们把报纸送到家里来。严格来说，这是实话。他只是答应订一份报纸，但并未特别要求送报上门。这就是律师惯用的技巧。

那天晚上，在林肯不知情的情况下，玛丽·托德给编辑写了一封言辞激烈的信，说明了自己对这份报纸的看法，并提出不再订阅。

编辑觉得受到了极大的侮辱，于是在报纸上公开发表了回信，并写信给林肯，要求他做出解释。这封公开信让林肯十分痛苦。为此，他还生了一场病。他十分屈辱地给编辑回信，尽他所能地解释这只是一场误会。

林肯曾想将他的继母接到家里过圣诞节，但玛丽·托德拒绝了。她看不起林肯的继母，也看不起汤姆·林肯和汉克斯家族的人。她以有这些亲戚感到羞耻。林肯也担心即便将父母接到家里来，玛丽也不会承认他们。于是二十三年来，他的继母一直住在距春田市七十英里的地方。每次都是林肯去看她，而她根本没有到过林肯的家。

林肯婚后唯一来家里做过客的亲戚是一位名叫哈丽特·汉克斯（Harriet Hanks）的远房表妹。她是一个懂事又乖巧的姑娘，林肯很喜欢她，于是当她来春田市上学的时候，林肯便邀请她住在自己家。林肯夫人不仅把她当用人一样使唤，还试图把家务都扔给她做。这一次，林肯极其反对玛丽的做法，认为这极端不公平。整件事到后来闹得十分不愉快。

玛丽总是不断和女佣起冲突。她请了很多个女佣，但每个都干不长。她那猛烈的怒火爆发了一两次后，女佣们便收拾东西离开了。她们鄙视玛丽，还以此告诫自己的朋友。很快，林肯家便上了女佣们的黑名单。

玛丽气得直冒烟，小题大做地给人写信，斥责她雇佣的“野蛮的爱尔兰人”根本不懂规矩。但是，只要给她干活儿，所有爱尔兰人都会变成“野蛮人”。她曾公开夸口说如果她比丈夫活得时间长，就搬去南方度过余生。在列克星敦，抚养她长大的那些人可不会容忍用人的任何冒失行为。如果黑奴不专心做事就会立刻被拉去广场，绑在鞭笞刑柱上任主人鞭挞。托德家的一个邻居曾经将六个黑奴鞭笞至死。

“高个子杰克”在当时是春田市的著名人物。他有几头骡子和一辆破旧的马车，经营着自称为“快递服务”的生意。他的侄女很不幸地成了林肯夫人的女佣。几天后，女佣和女主人大吵了一架。女佣扔掉了围裙，收拾了行李，头也不回地摔门而去。

当天下午，高个子杰克赶着骡子去了第八大街和杰克逊大街的拐角处，向林肯夫人拿回侄女留下的行李。林肯夫人大发脾气，用恶毒的语言狠狠地羞辱了他和他的侄女，还威胁说，如果杰克进来，就狠狠地打他一顿。杰克非常气愤，冲到了林肯的办公室，要求这个可怜的男人让他的太太道歉。

林肯听完了事情的来龙去脉后悲伤地说：“听到这样的事我感到很抱歉。但请允许我坦率地问你一句，这样的事情我每天都要面对，我已经忍受了十五年，你连一会儿都忍不了吗？”

他们的谈话以杰克对林肯表示同情并向林肯道歉自己打扰了他而结束。

不过曾有一个女佣在林肯夫人手下工作了两年多。对此，邻居们十分不解，认为这是个奇迹。原因其实很简单：林肯私下和这个女佣达成了一项协议。她第一天到林肯家的时候，林肯将她拉到一边，坦诚地告诉她接下来将要遭遇些什么。林肯向她表达了自己的同情，并告诉她自己无能为力，她必须得忍。如果她能做到，林肯就每周再补贴她一美金。

玛丽一如既往地向用人发脾气，但在林肯精神和金钱的秘密支持下，玛丽亚坚持了下来。每次林肯夫人骂完玛丽亚，林肯都会找机会趁玛丽亚一个人在厨房的时候偷偷溜进去，拍拍她的肩膀，鼓励她说：“就是这样，玛丽亚。鼓起勇气，继续干下去，继续干下去。”

后来这位女佣结婚了。她的丈夫在格兰特麾下服役。李将军投降后，玛丽亚立刻赶到了华盛顿，为丈夫申请即刻退役，因为她和孩子们十分需要他。林肯很高兴能再次见到玛丽亚。他们坐在桌边，聊起了过去的事情。林肯本想留她吃晚饭，但玛丽·托德不同意。于是林肯给了玛丽亚一篮子水果和一些钱买衣服，让她第二天打电话给他，并承诺给她一张通行证。但是她并没有打电话，因为当天晚上，林肯被暗杀了。

林肯夫人脾气多年来一直没变，因此常常招人痛恨。有的时候，她的行为就像疯子一样。

托德家的人本就有些古怪，而玛丽的父母是表兄妹，或许是近亲结婚加重了这种古怪的个性。总之，很多人，包括她的医生，都认为她患有先天性精神病。

林肯用基督徒般的耐心忍受着这一切，几乎从不责怪玛丽，但他的朋友们却没那么好说话。

赫恩登公开抨击玛丽是“野猫”和“母狼”。

林肯最疯狂的追随者特纳·金（Turner King）称玛丽是“一个该下地狱的恶人，一个女魔鬼”。他声称自己亲眼看见玛丽将林肯一次又一次地逐出家门。

华盛顿总统府秘书约翰·海（John Hay）给她起的绰号更难听，在这里还是不说为好。

春田市卫理公会教堂的牧师就住在林肯家附近。他和林肯是朋友。他的妻子证实林肯夫妇“家庭十分不和睦，总是看见林肯夫人拿着一把扫帚将丈夫赶出家门”。

詹姆斯·高莱（James Gourley）与林肯做了十六年邻居，他说林肯夫人“内心住着魔鬼”，说她总是出现幻觉，表现得像个疯婆子，一直哭闹到所有邻居都听见为止。她还要求有人守着她的房子，因为她觉得有坏人要袭击她。

随着时间的推移，她发脾气越来越频繁，越来越剧烈。林肯的朋友们都为他感到深深的难过。他没有家庭生活，也从来没有请哪怕是赫恩登和戴维斯法官那样的密友去家里吃过饭，因为他害怕会出事。他自己也尽可能地回避玛丽，晚上要么和其他律师在法律图书馆里聊天，要么在迪勒的药店里和一群男人讲故事。

有的时候，人们会看到林肯深夜时仍独自徘徊在人迹罕至的街道，头垂到胸口，神情阴郁而哀伤。有的时候他会说“我厌恶回家”，于是某个知情的朋友便会将他带回家过夜。

没有谁比赫恩登更了解林肯悲惨的家庭生活。赫恩登在自己写的《林肯传》第三卷第四百三十页至四百三十四页这样写道：

林肯先生从未有过知己，因此也从未把全部心事向别人倾诉过。他从不和我说他的那些伤脑筋的事情。而且据我所知，他也没有和其他朋友提起过。这样的负担非常沉重，但他悲伤地忍受着一切，一个字也不说。即便没有人告诉我，我也总是能感觉到他正处在痛苦中。他并不是一个喜欢早起的人，通常每天上午九点左右，他才来到办公室。我一般比他提前一个小时到。但有的时候，他七点就到了——有一次我记得天没亮他就到了。如果我走进办公室发现他已经在里面了，我便立刻知道他家中的海洋遭遇了风暴，正浪花涌动。他不是躺在躺椅上望着窗外，就是缩在椅子里，把脚搁在后窗的窗台上。看见我进门，他也不抬头，只是当我向他说“早上好”的时候咕哝一声作为回应。见他如此，我便立刻使自己忙碌起来，要么写写弄弄，要么翻看资料。但他的忧郁和痛苦是那么明显，他的沉默让人心惊，于是我自己也焦躁不安起来，只得找个借口离开，要么去法庭，要么去其他地方。

办公室的门是半玻璃的，朝向一条狭窄的走廊。门顶端有一条挂着铜圈的铁丝，铜圈下面垂着一块帘子。遇到这种情况，我出门时总会拉上帘子。我走楼梯下楼的时候，总会听见办公室锁门的声音，于是林肯就这样独自一人沉浸在悲伤中。我通常在法院办事员那儿待上一个小时，接着又在周边的商店里逛一个小时，然后便回去了。等到我回去的时候，要么客户已经上门，林肯正为他提供法律方面的咨询；要么愁云已经消散，林肯正背诵着一篇印第安纳故事来释放早上积攒在心中的阴郁。中午的时候，我回家吃饭。一个小时后我回到办公室，常会发现他还在那里，吃着趁我不在时从楼下店里买来的奶酪和薄脆饼干——尽管从办公室穿过几个街区就能到他家了。晚上五点或六点下班后，他依旧落在我后面，要么坐在楼梯下的箱子上逗游手好闲的路人开心，要么坐在法院门前的台阶上以同样的方式消磨时间。天黑之后，办公室的灯光一直亮着——他也一直待在办公室里。直到深夜，全世界都入睡后，那个注定成为这个国家的总统的高个子男人才会离开办公室，沿着街道上树木和大楼的阴影，缓缓地走着，最后悄悄溜进一栋高矮适中的房子——一个人们通常称之为“家”的地方。

也许有人会说，这个画面太夸张了。对此我只能说，他们不了解实情。

有一次，林肯夫人对丈夫的攻击实在是太残暴、太没完没了了，以至于就连“对谁都没有恶意，唯以怜悯对待众生”的林肯也失控了。他抓住她的手臂，将她从厨房里拽到大门口，说：“你毁了我的一生！你把这个家变成了地狱。现在，去你的，给我滚出去！”

如果林肯和安·拉特利奇结婚，无论如何，他都会过得很幸福，但同时也不会成为总统。他的思想和行动都很迟缓，而安也不是那种会驱使他获取政治名望的女人。但玛丽·托德执着地坚持着自己进入白宫的决心。她一嫁给林肯，便一直敦促他为辉格党的国会议员提名而奋斗。

提名之战十分激烈。他的政敌对他进行了难以置信的指控。他们斥责他是一个没有信仰的异教徒，因为他不属于任何教会。他们还说他是金钱和贵族的工具，因为他通过婚姻依附于高傲的托德家族和爱德华家族。虽然这些指控十分可笑，但林肯还是认为它们有可能破坏自己的仕途，于是他这样回复了那些批评者：“自从我到了春田市后，只有一位亲戚探望过我。他在离开之前还被指控偷了一支单簧口琴。如果这就是我来自骄傲的贵族家庭的证据，那我确实有罪。”

选举开始了，但林肯被击败了。这是他政治生涯中的第一次挫折。

两年后，他再次参加了竞选。这一次他胜利了。玛丽·林肯一阵狂喜，她相信林肯政治上的胜利才刚刚开始，于是她订了一件新的晚礼服，并努力练习法语。她的丈夫一到华盛顿，她写信时的收件人便成了“尊敬的亚伯拉罕·林肯”。不过林肯立刻阻止她这样称呼自己。

玛丽也想要住到华盛顿。她十分渴望自己成为社交圈的宠儿，也十分确信那些社会声望就在前面等着她。但等到了东部和林肯团聚时，她才发现现实和她的期待有很大的差距。林肯很穷，在拿到政府发放的第一笔薪水之前，他不得不向道格拉斯借钱维持生计。因此林肯夫妇只能暂住在斯普里格斯夫人位于达夫格林大街上的寄宿公寓中。斯普里格斯夫人的公寓门前是一条未铺石砖的泥土路，人行道上满是灰尘和沙砾。公寓的房间十分阴冷，也没有管道。斯普里格斯夫人的后院里有一个户外厕所、一个鹅圈和一个园子。邻居家的猪时不时会闯进园子啃食她的蔬菜，这时她的小儿子便会拿着一根棍子将它们赶走。

当时的华盛顿还没有专人收拾垃圾，因此斯普里格斯太太便将垃圾倒在后面的巷子里，指望它们能被那些在巷子中自由走动的牛、猪、鹅吃掉。

林肯夫人发现华盛顿上流社会社交圈的大门向她紧闭着。没有人注意到她，她只能坐在阴冷的寄宿公寓里，陪伴她的只有头疼和被宠坏的孩子——一听到斯普里格斯太太的小儿子尖叫着将猪群赶出卷心菜田的声音，她便觉得头疼。

这样的生活虽然令人失望，但是和潜伏在拐角处的政治灾难比起来，实在是微不足道。林肯进入国会时，美国向墨西哥发起的战争已持续了二十个月。这是一场令人羞耻的侵略战争，是国会中支持奴隶制的议员挑起的一场别有用心的战争。他们的目的是让美国获得更多的领土，让奴隶制蔓延其上，这样，支持奴隶制的议员就能在选举中胜出。

在那场战争中，美国完成了两件事。得克萨斯州原本属于墨西哥，这次美国迫使墨西哥将其主权让给了美国。此外，美国有意掠夺了墨西哥一半的领土，将它们划分成了新墨西哥州、亚利桑那州、内华达州和加利福尼亚州。

格兰特说这是有史以来最邪恶的战争之一，而他因为曾经参战而永远无法原谅自己。很多美国士兵在战争中造了反，投入了敌人的怀抱。圣塔·安那（Santa Anna）将军的部队中就有一支著名的全部由美国逃兵组成的营队。

林肯在国会中站了出来，做了许多辉格党人已经做过的事。他强烈谴责总统发动了“一场充满了掠夺和谋杀，抢劫和耻辱的战争”。他还宣称上帝“一定忘记了保卫弱小和无辜的人民，才会允许来自地狱的杀人犯和恶魔屠戮男人、女人和孩子，才会夺走了这块土地上的公正，让它满目疮痍”。

华盛顿方面并没有注意到林肯的演讲，因为当时的林肯默默无闻。但是在春田市，这场演讲引起了轩然大波。伊利诺伊州派了六千人参战，他们相信这是保卫自由的神圣之战，然而他们的议员代表却在国会上称他们的战士是来自地狱的魔鬼，还指控他们是谋杀犯。于是，愤怒而激动的党徒们公开集会，谴责林肯“卑贱、懦弱、无耻，是叛国的游击队员”，是“第二个本尼迪克特·阿诺德（Benedict Arnold）(1)”。

在一次会议上，大家一致认为，他们从没见过哪个人“像林肯这样丢脸”，“对那些活着的勇士和英勇牺牲的逝者的恶意抹黑和贬低，只会激起每一个真正的伊利诺伊人心中无比的愤慨”。

这股强烈的愤恨之情积郁了十多年，直到十三年后林肯竞选总统时，还有人因此而愤怒地辱骂他。

“我这无疑是在政治自杀。”林肯对他的法律合伙人坦白道。

林肯害怕回到春田市面对那些满心愤恨的选民，因此想谋一个能留在华盛顿的职位。他竭力想获得“土地局委员”这个职位，但失败了。

接着他又努力使自己被提名为“俄勒冈州长”，希望待俄勒冈加入联邦时，他能成为第一批参议员。不过这一次，他又失败了。

于是，他回到了春田市，回到了自己脏兮兮的律所办公室。他再一次将“老公鹿”套上挽具，驾着他那摇摇晃晃的破马车，在第八司法区巡回服务。就这样，林肯成了整个伊利诺伊州最沮丧的人。

他决定忘记政治，专心从事法律工作。他意识到自己工作毫无章法，缺乏思维训练，因此为了锻炼自己的逻辑论证和表达能力，他买了一本几何书，在巡回咨询的路上边走边看。

赫恩登在他的传记中这样写道：

在狭小的乡村旅馆里，我们常挤在一张床上睡觉。大多数情况下，床对林肯来说都太小了，因此他总是把脚伸出去，将一小截小腿露在外面。他在床头放一把椅子，椅子上燃着一支蜡烛，然后读几个小时书。我知道他能用这种姿势看书至深夜两点。此时，我和偶然同屋的人早已酣然入睡。就这样，他一边巡回咨询，一边自学了欧几里得几何，到后来，他已能够轻松地证明出六卷书中所有的命题。

掌握了几何后，他又学习了代数，然后是天文学，后来又准备就语言的起源和发展做一场演讲。但他最感兴趣的还是莎士比亚。他依旧保持着在新塞勒姆村时受杰克·凯尔索影响而培养出来的文学品味。

从这个时期开始直至生命终结，亚伯拉罕·林肯身上最显著的特点便是他那深沉的、无法用语言描述的悲伤。

杰西·维克（Jesse Weik）在帮赫恩登整理那本不朽的传记时，觉得其中对林肯内心悲伤情绪的描写实在是有些夸大其词，于是他和与林肯相识多年的友人们——例如斯图尔特、惠特尼、马西尼、斯韦特和戴维斯法官——就这一点进行了详细的讨论。

经过这番访问，维克才相信“没有亲眼见过林肯的人，无法体会他身上的那种忧郁”。赫恩登也同意这个看法，为此还做了进一步的阐述。前文我已经引用过，他说：“这二十年来，我实在没有看到林肯有哪一天是快乐的。那张永远充满着悲伤的脸庞，是林肯最突出的特点。他走路的时候，哀伤就从他身上一滴一滴地淌下来。”

林肯在巡回办案的过程中，经常会与两三个律师同住在一个房间里。他们早上总会被林肯的声音吵醒。只见林肯坐在床沿，嘟嘟囔囔地自言自语着。起床后他会点燃炉火，盯着火苗一坐就是几个小时。每当这时，他总会背诵这句诗：“人啊，你有什么值得骄傲的呢？”

有时他走在街上，内心却陷入了深深的绝望，以至于根本看不见迎面走来与他说话的熟人。偶尔他也会与人握手，但神情茫然，根本不知道自己在做什么。

林肯的崇拜者乔纳森·伯奇（Jonathan Birch）这样说道：

林肯在布卢明顿出庭时，时而能让审判室、办公室或者大街上的人捧腹大笑，时而又会让他们陷入沉思。他那严肃的样子，让人不敢打搅……他会坐在靠墙的椅子上，脚踩在椅子下方的横木上，双腿向上曲着，膝盖顶着下巴，双手抱膝，帽子倾向前方，眼神中满是无穷无尽的悲伤——完全是一幅沮丧和忧郁的画面。我曾见过他像这样一动不动地坐了好几个小时，就连最亲近的朋友也无法让他回过神来。

贝弗里奇参议员可以说是对林肯的事业研究得最为彻底的一个人。他说：“从一八四九年起至去世的这段时间里，林肯身上最突出的特质便是他那深不可测的悲伤。普通人是无论如何也无法感受或者揣度这种悲伤的。”

当然，林肯那用之不竭的幽默感和他讲故事的卓越能力，与他的忧郁一样，也是他突出的特点，是他个性中不可分割的部分。

有的时候，戴维斯法官不惜休庭也要听他讲那些欢闹的故事。

赫恩登说，“经常会有两三百人围在林肯身边”，捧腹大笑几个小时而不愿离开。

一位曾切身经历过的人回忆道，当林肯抖包袱的时候，人们便会笑得大叫起来，滚到椅子下面。

那些非常熟悉林肯的人都认为，“他那深不可测的悲伤”的罪魁祸首是这两件事：政治上的失意和婚姻生活的不幸福。

就这样，林肯度过了六年辛酸而完全被政坛遗忘的时光。然后突然间，一件足以改变林肯一生的事情发生了。从此以后，林肯开始了进军白宫的历程。

而这件事背后的始作俑者便是玛丽·林肯的老情人史蒂芬·道格拉斯。





13


一八五四年，林肯身上发生了一件惊天动地的大事。事情的起源是《密苏里妥协案》的废除。《密苏里妥协案》的情况大致是这样的：

一八一九年，密苏里想要作为蓄奴州加入联邦。北方拒绝了密苏里的请求，局势一下子变得紧张起来。终于，那个时代出色的公众人物们经过不断努力和周旋，最终签署了我们现在熟知的《密苏里妥协案》。自此，南方得到了他们想要的：将密苏里作为蓄奴州纳入联邦。北方也得到了他们想要的：密苏里南面边界以北的任何西部区域都不允许蓄奴。

人们认为这份妥协案能够平息关于奴隶制的纷争，事实上它确实起了作用，只是维持的时间并不长。但是现在，距妥协案签署三十多年后，道格拉斯却意欲废除这份协议。妥协案一旦废除，密西西比河以西，面积相当于最初十三个州的大片区域便会因奴隶制的祸害而满目疮痍。为了废除妥协案，道格拉斯在国会中进行了长久而又艰难的斗争。这场斗争持续了好几个月。议员们在众议院中展开了激烈的辩论，甚至有议员跳上桌子，还拿出了闪着寒光的刀枪。后来，道格拉斯进行了一场慷慨激昂又动人心魄的演讲，从午夜一直持续到黎明。于是一八五四年三月四日，议会通过了道格拉斯的提案。这是一件惊天动地的大事。信差们穿梭在仍沉睡着的华盛顿市的大街小巷，大声地宣布着这个消息。海军司令部炮声隆隆，欢迎着一个新时代的到来——一个注定要浸满鲜血的时代。

道格拉斯为什么要这么做？似乎没有人知道。戴着无边便帽的历史学家们至今仍对此争论不休。但有一点我们是可以确定的：道格拉斯希望赢得一八五六年的总统大选。他知道废除妥协案能帮助他获得南方的支持。

那北方怎么办？

“说实话，我知道这件事会给北方带来一场猛烈的风暴。”道格拉斯说。

他说得没错。事实也确实如此。这件事掀起了一场飓风，两大党派也因此被撕扯得支离破碎。最终，这场飓风将整个国家卷入了内战之中。

充满愤怒的抗议集会瞬间燃遍了数百座城镇和乡村。人们疯狂地谴责史蒂芬·道格拉斯，称他为“叛徒阿诺德”(2)，还说他当初是按照本尼迪克特·阿诺德取的名字。他被贴上了“现代犹大”的标签。人们送了他三十块银币(3)，还给了他一根绳子，让他自我了断。

教会也发起了愤怒而神圣的抗议。新英格兰的三千零五十名牧师“以万能的上帝和圣灵之名”，联合向参议员递交了一封抗议信。社会舆论更是沸沸扬扬，那些激烈的言论助长着大众的愤怒。在芝加哥，即便是民主党的报纸也开始用无比恶毒的言辞讨伐道格拉斯。

八月，国会休会，于是道格拉斯返回了家乡。沿途所见的景象让他十分震惊。后来他说，一路上只见人们焚烧着他那脖子上绞着绳子的肖像，熊熊的火光足以照亮他从波士顿回到伊利诺伊州的路途。

道格拉斯并不是逆来顺受的怯懦之人，于是他宣布要在芝加哥进行演说。在他的家乡，人们因为这件事几近疯狂地憎恨他。报纸上满是质问他的文章。怒不可遏的牧师们声称绝不允许他“再用口中那不忠的气息污染伊利诺伊州的空气”。男人们冲到了五金店，等到了日落的时候，整个城市所有的左轮手枪都卖完了。他的敌人们发誓不会让他活到为自己臭名昭著的罪行辩护那天。

道格拉斯踏入芝加哥的那一刻，港口的船只全都降了半旗，二十几个教堂一齐敲响了丧钟，哀悼自由的死亡。

他进行演说的那一晚是芝加哥有史以来最热的一晚。男人们懒散地坐在椅子上，汗水顺着他们的脸颊流了下来。女人们争先恐后地向湖畔蜂拥而去，只为在凉爽的沙地上睡个好觉。在推搡的过程中，好多女人晕了过去。套着马具的马儿热得倒在大街上，奄奄一息。

尽管天气十分炎热，仍有数以千计兴奋的男人在口袋中塞上枪，成群结队地去听道格拉斯的演说。芝加哥没有能容纳那么多人的会堂，因此道格拉斯决定在公共广场发表演说。广场里人山人海，还有数百人站在阳台上，甚至还有人跨坐在周边的屋顶上。

道格拉斯一开口说话，听众便报以抱怨的咆哮和嘘声。他继续演说——或者说，继续尝试演说——听众则继续发出嘘声，并大声地谩骂起来，还唱起了侮辱他的歌曲。那连篇的脏话猥琐得不堪入耳，实在是无法写成文字印刷出版，因此这里便不再细述了。

道格拉斯的随从们也激动起来，恨不得和这些人打上一架。道格拉斯却恳求他们安静，他说自己可以制服这些暴徒。他不断尝试控制局面，却不断失败。当他诋毁《芝加哥论坛报》的时候，台下的人群便为这份报纸欢呼。他威胁说如果听众不安静下来听他演说，他就在这里站一整夜。台下响起了八千人的合唱声：“天不亮，我们就不回家。天不亮，我们就不回家。”

那是周六晚上。最终，经过了四个小时徒劳的尝试，受尽侮辱的道格拉斯拿出了手表，对着台下咆哮着、怒吼着、乱哄哄的人们喊道：“现在已经是周日早上了。我要去教堂了，你们也可以去地狱了。”

精疲力竭的道格拉斯终于放弃了，默默地走下了讲台。风光无限的小巨人人生中第一次尝到了失败和屈辱的滋味。

第二天早上，各大报纸铺天盖地地详细报道了这件事的来龙去脉。而对这些报道最为满意的，莫过于远在春田市的一位高傲而丰满，有着深褐色头发的中年妇女。十五年前，她曾梦想成为道格拉斯夫人。这么多年来，她眼睁睁地看着道格拉斯平步青云，成了全国最受欢迎、最有权势的政治领袖，而与此同时，自己的丈夫却一次一次地遭受挫折，受尽屈辱，因此她心里是非常痛恨这一切的。

不过现在，谢天谢地，傲慢的道格拉斯终于倒霉了。他在自己的州内分裂了自己的党派，而且还是在大选前夕。这可是林肯的好机会。玛丽·林肯心里非常清楚，现在是林肯的最佳时机——他不仅能赢回一八四八年失去的民众的支持，还可以借此重回政治舞台，当选为国会议员。没错，道格拉斯确实还有四年的任期，但他的同事几个月后就得面临改选了。

他的同事是谁呢？他的同事便是趾高气昂而又好斗的爱尔兰人希尔兹（Shields）。玛丽·林肯和他还有一笔旧账要算。早在一八四二年，估计是因为玛丽写了几封信羞辱希尔兹，希尔兹一怒之下向林肯发起决斗。两个人配着马刀，在助手的陪伴下来到了密西西比河的一处沙堤上，准备决一死战。幸好最后关头朋友们竭力调解，最终没有发生流血事件。自那以后，希尔兹的仕途扶摇直上，而林肯却每况愈下。

但现在，已经触底的林肯开始反弹了。他自己也说，《密苏里妥协案》的废除“唤醒”了他。他再也不能保持沉默。现在的他已决定加入战斗，用灵魂中所有的力量和信仰去战斗。

于是他开始准备自己的演说。他在州图书馆里埋头工作了几个星期，翻阅了很多历史书籍，掌握了大量的史实，并将它们分类整理。当年，这项议案的通过之路可谓血雨腥风，议员们你来我往，进行了一连串狂风暴雨般的激烈辩论。林肯在准备演说期间也将这些辩论仔细研究了一番。

十月三日，州集会在春田市开幕了。成千上万的农民涌入了市中：男人们带来了上等的猪、马、牛和谷物，女人们拿来了果冻、果酱、馅饼和蜜饯。但是对于民众来说，集会上的这些物品远不如另一件事来得有吸引力。而这件事，早已在这几个星期里被宣扬得沸沸扬扬：道格拉斯将会在集会的第一天发表演说。因此，春田市聚集了州内各党派前来聆听道格拉斯演讲的政客。

那天下午，道格拉斯的演说持续了三个多小时。他回顾了自己的言论，并对此做出解释。他为自己的观点辩解，同时也向反对意见进行了攻击。他激烈地否认自己“试图在某个地区将奴隶制合法化”，同时也否认自己“试图将奴隶制赶出某个区域”。他认为，奴隶制的去留应该由各州的人民自己做决定。

“当然，”他大声喊道，“如果堪萨斯州和内布拉斯加州的人民有能力实现自治，他们肯定也有能力管好那几个可怜的黑奴。”

林肯坐在前排，仔细地聆听着道格拉斯说的每个字，默默地权衡着他的每一个论据。待道格拉斯演讲结束后，林肯宣布道：“明天，我将揭开他的谬误之处。”

第二天早晨，春田市的每个角落都撒满了林肯将要答复道格拉斯的宣传单，市集中更是俯拾即是。民众的兴趣非常强烈，还不到两点钟，演讲大厅已经座无虚席。没过多久，道格拉斯也来了，气度非凡地坐在演讲台上。和往常一样，他仍旧衣着光鲜，打扮得无可挑剔。

玛丽·林肯早早便坐在了观众席中。那天早晨出门前，她兴奋地为林肯刷干净外套，并拿出了一件新衬领，仔细地将他最好的领带熨烫整齐。她非常希望林肯能在仪表上给民众留下一个好印象。但是那天非常炎热，林肯知道讲堂里的空气到时一定闷热得令人难受，于是他没穿外套，没穿背心，没戴衬领，没系领带，只穿着衬衣便走上了讲台。他的衬衣松松垮垮地罩在瘦削的骨架上，颀长而嶙峋的棕色脖子突兀地露在衬衣上方。他的头发乱糟糟的，脚上的靴子又脏又破，还有那根被称为“单带裤”的裤带，吊着他那条又短又不合身的裤子。

一看到丈夫的模样，玛丽·林肯又气恼又失望。她窘迫得满脸通红，差点儿没绝望得流下眼泪来。

当时没有人能想到——但是我们很清楚——这个其貌不扬、让妻子感到羞耻的男人，就在那个炎热的十月的下午，走上了一条注定要永垂不朽的道路。

那天下午，他发表了一生中最伟大的一次演说。如果以那天下午作为分界线，将林肯在那天下午之前及之后发表的演说分别集结成册，再将两本书放在一起比较，你很难相信它们出自同一人。因为那天下午发表演说的是一个全新的林肯——一个因为世间不义而愤然觉醒的林肯；一个为了受压迫的民族而恳切发声的林肯；一个为了人类道德尊严而动容、振奋的林肯。

他回顾了奴隶制的历史，并给出了厌弃奴隶制的五个强有力的理由。

同时，他的演讲也表现出了相当崇高的宽容。他说：“我对南方人民并没有偏见。如果处在他们的位置，我们也会做他们现在做的事。如果他们身边不存在奴隶制，那么他们也不会引进这一制度。如果我们身边存在着奴隶制，我们也不会立刻就摒弃它。所以，当南方人民说，他们和我们一样，对奴隶制的兴起并不负责时，我是赞同的。当人们说现存的奴隶制很难用一种令人满意的方式废除时，我理解同时也认可这种说法，因为我不会为那些我自己也不知道该如何做的事而责怪别人做得不好。即便我现在权倾天下，也不知道该如何处理现存的制度。”

三个多小时过去了。汗水从林肯的脸上滚落，但他却浑然不知，有理有据地回应道格拉斯，指出那位参议员演说中的诡辩和绝对的立场错误。

这是一场意义深远的演说，同时也是一场一定能给人留下深刻记忆的演说。道格拉斯坐在台下，皱眉蹙额，内心翻腾。他甚至时不时地站起来打断林肯。

新的选举时刻就快到了。民主党中的年轻进步人士一边攻击道格拉斯，一边四处争取选票。于是，当伊利诺伊州的选民们投票的时候，民主党中支持道格拉斯的成员受到了毁灭性的打击。

在那个时代，参议员是由州议会选出来的。为此，伊利诺伊州州议会于一八五五年二月八日在春田市召开了会议。为了这个场合，林肯夫人特意买了一件新礼服和一顶新帽子，而她的姐夫尼尼安·爱德华也信心满满地为参议员林肯安排着当天晚上的接待会。

第一轮投票的时候，林肯领先其他候选人，但仅有六票的优势。随着投票的进行，他的票数渐渐落后。到第十轮投票的时候，他已完全落后了。最后，李曼·特朗布尔（Lyman W. Trumbull）当选为州参议员。

李曼·特朗布尔的妻子茱莉亚·杰恩（Julia Jayne）是玛丽·林肯结婚时的女傧相，也曾是玛丽·林肯最亲密的朋友。那天下午，玛丽和茱莉亚并肩坐在众议院的包间里，紧张地关注着参议员的选举。当宣布茱莉亚的丈夫当选时，林肯夫人非常生气，头也不回地走出了大楼。对于这样的结果，玛丽怒气冲冲，妒火中烧，因此从那时起直至生命终结，她再也没有和茱莉亚·特朗布尔说过话。

悲伤又沮丧的林肯不得不回到他那凌乱的法律事务所，回到那间墙上染着墨水印子、从书架顶层的灰尘里长出野草的办公室。

一周后，他再次给“老公鹿”套上挽具，踏上不平静的草原，辗转于各个乡村法院之间。但他的心已不在法律上。现在的他，谈论的话题除了政治和奴隶制，几乎不涉及其他内容。他说，一想到数百万人缚于枷锁之中，他的心便痛苦不已。为此，他陷入忧郁的次数比以前更多了，沉浸在悲伤中的时间也更长了。他的悲伤变得更加深沉。

一天晚上，林肯和另一位律师一起住在乡间旅馆。这位同伴在凌晨醒来时，发现林肯穿着睡衣坐在床沿，神情沮丧，大概是思考着什么。林肯自言自语地咕哝着，陷入了看不见的虚无之中。最终，林肯回过神来，他说：

“我跟你说，这个国家不可能永远处于一半奴隶制一半自由的状态。”

这件事之后没多久，一位黑人妇女来到了春田市寻求林肯的帮助。这位妇人十分可怜。她的儿子去了圣路易斯市，在密西西比河上的一艘轮船上找了份工作。可是当他到达新奥尔良市的时候，却被送进了监狱。他本是自由人，但却拿不出文件证明这一点，于是直到船离开，他也没能出狱。现在，为了支付监狱的费用，他将被以奴隶的身份出售。

林肯将这个案子拿到了伊利诺伊州州长面前，可是州长说自己无权干涉。于是林肯向路易斯安那州的州长求助，可是这位州长在回信中也表示自己无能为力。林肯再次拜访伊利诺伊州州长，恳求他采取行动，但州长仍是摇了摇头。

林肯从椅子上站起来，无比坚定地大声说道：“上帝作证，州长，你也许确实没有合法权力释放那个可怜的男孩，但是我一定会使这个国家的每片土地都让奴隶主无法立足。”

第二年，林肯四十六岁，他坦诚地向好友惠特尼吐露自己“有点儿需要”一副眼镜了。于是他走进了一间饰品店，花了三十七点五美分买了人生中第一副眼镜。

现在，请各位读者随我来到一八五八年夏天。在此，我们将看到亚伯拉罕·林肯打赢了人生第一场重大战役。同时我们也将看到，他从地方上一个默默无闻之辈脱颖而出，成为参与美国历史上那场著名的政治战争的伟人。

这时他已经四十九岁了。经过了这么多年的挣扎和努力，他收获了什么呢？

生意上，他曾一败涂地。

婚姻上，他拥有的是绝对的不幸福。

法律上，他算是成功，一年可赚得三千美金。但是在政治上，他遇到的只有挫折和失败，那份珍藏在心中的渴望也未能获得满足。

“对我来说，”他承认道，“在那场本可以实现抱负的比赛中我失败了，我是个十足的失败者。”

但从现在开始，一切都变了。他的事业快速发展，以令人眼花缭乱的速度突飞猛进。虽然再过七年他便去世了，但在这七年里，他所获得的名望和荣耀，足以千秋万代地流传下去。

在这场我们即将关注的战役中，林肯的对手正是史蒂芬·道格拉斯。当时的道格拉斯是全民偶像，是享誉全球的政治领袖。

在《密苏里妥协案》被废弃后的四年里，道格拉斯打了一场历史上少见的壮观又戏剧化的翻身仗，恢复了政治声望。事情是这样的：

堪萨斯州要求作为蓄奴州加入联邦。堪萨斯州能进入联邦吗？对此，道格拉斯的答案是“不能”。他认为堪萨斯州构建州宪法的州议会不是一个真正的州议会，它的议员都是凭借欺骗和猎枪当选的。堪萨斯州一半的定居人口——拥有选举权的定居人口——都没有注册过，所以也不能投票。但是，住在密苏里西部支持奴隶制的五千名民主党人，却一点儿也没有受到堪萨斯州合法投票权的限制。他们去了一座联邦军械库，武装了自己，然后在选举当天旌旗摇曳、锣鼓喧天地进入堪萨斯州——为奴隶制投票。整件事就是一场闹剧，一种对正义的恶意曲解。

自由州的人们又做了些什么呢？他们用行动来说话。他们擦拭猎枪，给来复枪上好油，为了提高射击技术，不断地通过向挂在树上的招牌和谷仓门上的木板节孔射击来练手。很快，他们一边行进，一边操练，还不忘一边饮酒作乐。他们挖了战壕，快速地堆起了矮防护墙，还将旅馆变成了要塞。既然他们不能通过投票赢得正义，那就只能靠子弹了。

北方几乎每一个城镇和乡村都有专业的演说家，他们对着市民高谈阔论。他们说要为堪萨斯州募集资金购买武器，便以帽子为集钱容器，在市民间传递。在布鲁克林，亨利·沃德·比彻（Henry Ward Beecher）一边捶着演讲台一边大声地宣称，在拯救堪萨斯州这件事上，枪支比《圣经》有用得多。从那时起，夏普式步枪便被称为“比彻的《圣经》”。这些枪支装在贴有“圣经”标签（或者“陶器”、“修订法”标签）的箱子和桶里，从东部运至堪萨斯州。

在五名自由州的定居者接连遭遇暗杀后，一位年迈的牧羊人坐不住了。他是一名狂热的宗教信徒，平时也种点儿葡萄，酿些葡萄酒。他在堪萨斯州的平原上起义。他说：“我别无选择。这是全能的主的命令，我必须惩罚那些支持奴隶制的人，杀一儆百。”

他的名字叫约翰·布朗（John Brown）。他住在奥萨沃托米。

五月的一天晚上，他打开《圣经》，向家人诵读了大卫的诗，然后全家人跪下祈祷。唱了几首赞美诗后，他和四个儿子及一个女婿跨上了马，越过草原，来到一间小屋，将屋里支持奴隶制的主人和他的两个儿子从床上拽了出来，砍掉了他们的手臂，还用斧子让他们的脑袋搬了家。天亮之前下了一场雨，雨水冲散了从尸体的脑壳中流出的脑浆。

从那时起，双方开始相互杀戮。“流血的堪萨斯”一词便因此进入了史书。

现在，史蒂芬·道格拉斯知道，一个虚假的、充满了欺骗和背叛的州议会制定的州宪法，根本不值得被书写成册并用吸墨水纸吸干墨迹。

于是道格拉斯要求堪萨斯州重新举办一场诚实而又和平的选举，让它的人民重新投票决定是以蓄奴州还是自由州的身份加入联邦。

他的请求是绝对正义的，也是绝对高尚的，但是当时的美国总统詹姆斯·布坎南（James Buchanan）以及华盛顿其他傲慢的、赞同奴隶制的政客是不能容忍重新选举这种事的。

于是布坎南和道格拉斯吵翻了。

总统威胁道格拉斯，说要断送他的政治前途。道格拉斯回敬道：“上帝作证，先生，我可以成就詹姆斯·布坎南，也可以毁了他。”

道格拉斯的这句话不仅是威胁，同时也创造了历史。当时，奴隶制的政治势力和高傲姿态已到达顶峰。自此以后，它的势力便突然开始快速又戏剧化地减弱。

接下来的一场斗争是奴隶制走向终点的开端。在这场斗争中，道格拉斯严重地分裂了民主党派，为一八六〇年大选民主党的失败埋下了祸根，同时也使得林肯当选不仅成了一种可能，更是一种必然。

道格拉斯将自己的政治前途押在了这场他自己坚信的、北方人民也坚信的、为了崇高的原则而进行的无私的战斗上。为此，他得到了伊利诺伊州人民的青睐。现在，重回家乡的时候，道格拉斯已成为全国上下仰慕崇拜的英雄。

那个曾在一八五四年驱赶过道格拉斯、以降半旗和鸣丧钟的方式迎接他入城的芝加哥，现在特派了一列专车护送他回家。列车上还安排了铜管乐队和接待委员会。当他进入城区的时候，迪尔伯恩公园的一百五十座加农礼炮齐鸣，数百个男人跑来和他握手，数千位妇女将花投在了他的脚下。人们以他的名字给长子命名。甚至可以毫不夸张地说，他的一些狂热支持者甚至愿意为他上绞架。在他去世四十年后，仍有人吹嘘自己是“道格拉斯派民主党”。

就在道格拉斯光荣返乡几个月后，伊利诺伊州的民众便要开始选举国会议员了。民主党派自然是提名道格拉斯。共和党会提名谁来和道格拉斯一决雌雄呢？他就是默默无闻的林肯。

在接下来的竞选中，林肯和道格拉斯进行了一系列激烈的辩论。正是这些辩论让林肯一举成名。他们围绕着那些牵动民心的问题进行辩论，民众的热情前所未有地高涨。人们蜂拥着前去听他们辩论，人数之多堪称美国历史之最。没有礼堂能容纳那么多人，所以他们的辩论总是安排在下午的小树林或宽阔的平原上。记者们追着他们跑，报纸上满是他们的轰动性言论，于是渐渐地，两人的听众遍布整个国家。

两年后，林肯入主了白宫。

正是他和道格拉斯的这些辩论为他做了宣传，铺平了道路。

早在竞选前几个月，林肯便已准备起来。当思路和想法以及某些词句出现在大脑里时，林肯就会将它们写下来——写在零碎的纸上，有时是信封的背面，有时是报纸的边角处，抑或是纸袋的碎片上。他把这些纸片放在高高的丝绸礼帽里，随身携带。最后他会将这些零碎的想法誊写到大纸上，一边誊写一边大声朗读，不断地修改、重写和改进。

完成了第一次演讲的草稿后，林肯在某天晚上邀请了几位亲密的朋友去了州议会的图书馆。他把门锁上，大声地朗读演讲内容，每一段结束后便停下来询问朋友们的意见，希望他们能多提建议。这次演讲包含了很多林肯著名的预言性言论，例如：

“分裂之家无可持存。”

“我相信这个国家不可能永远处于一半奴隶制一半自由的状态。”

“我并不希望联邦解散——我也不希望房屋倾塌——但我的确希望它停止分裂。”

“国家将会采取一个制度，非此即彼。”

听着林肯的演讲词，他的朋友们十分震惊，同时也警觉起来。他们觉得这些话太激进了，是“傻子才会说的胡言乱语”，只会将选民赶走。

最终，林肯缓缓站了起来，告诉强烈反对他的朋友们自己心意已决。他说，“分裂之家无可持存。”这句话是人类世界的普遍真理——就此，林肯结束了这次讨论会。

“六千年来，这一直是真理。”林肯说，“我希望用简单易懂的语言，将这个放之四海皆准的道理讲给民众听，让他们认识到当下的危险。说出这个真理的时机已经到来，我已决定坚持自己的主张，也不会对它做过多的修饰。如果必要，我愿意与这个真理一同毁灭。如果注定我要因为这一篇演讲而跌入谷底，那就让我和真理一起走向灭亡吧，让我为了维护公平和正义而灭亡吧。”




八月二十一日，第一场大型辩论在距芝加哥七十五英里处的渥太华镇举行。前一天晚上，大批民众就陆续赶到了那里。很快，旅馆、私人住宅和车马行都挤满了人，小镇周围一英里的峭壁和谷地设满了营地，篝火通明，就好像被入侵的军队包围了一样。

破晓之前，人潮再次涌了进来。初升的太阳从伊利诺伊平原上缓缓升起，照亮小镇上那挤满了轻便马车和四轮货车的街道，照亮着如潮水般的人群，还有那坐在马背上的男男女女。那天非常炎热，玉米田和牧场上方也因为连续好几周不下雨而漂浮着大团大团的灰尘。

中午的时候，一辆十七节车厢的专列到达了芝加哥。车厢里人头攒动，不仅座位上挤满了人，连走道里也站满了人，甚至还有心情迫切的乘客坐到了车顶上。

方圆四十英里内的每一个镇都带上了自己的乐队，一路上锣鼓喧天。民兵们踏着重重的脚步，列队前行。江湖医生们免费表演蛇秀，顺带售卖自己的止疼片。魔术师和柔体杂技师在酒吧门前表演。乞丐和妓女不停地揽着生意。爆竹噼啪作响，礼炮隆隆轰鸣，吓得马儿惊慌逃窜。

一辆六匹白马拉着的精致马车载着声名显赫的道格拉斯在城镇之间穿行。民众的欢呼声响彻天空，持续不断。

林肯的拥护者们为了表达对这种豪华排场的蔑视，特意让林肯坐上一辆老旧的干草架，由一队白色骡子拉着走在大街上。林肯身后跟着另一辆干草架，上面坐着三十二个姑娘，每个姑娘身上都戴着一个州的名字，她们头顶挂着一条巨大的标语，上面写着：

帝国之星踏上西进征途。

各州不能离开林肯，如同母亲不能离开土地。

在会场里，发言人、委员和记者在人群中挤了半个小时才到达演讲台。

为了抵挡炽热的阳光，演讲台上方搭建了一个木制的遮阳棚。竟有二十多个人爬到了遮阳棚上面，没想到遮阳棚承受不住他们的重量，一下子塌了。掉落的木条砸在了道格拉斯后援委员们的身上。

两位演讲人不管从哪方面看都是那么不同。

道格拉斯身材中等，只有五英尺四英寸，林肯却是一个六英尺四英寸的大高个儿。

大高个儿嗓音尖细，是个男高音。小个子嗓音浑厚，是个男中音。

道格拉斯举止体面而文雅，林肯却丑陋而笨拙。

道格拉斯身上有一种大众偶像式的个人魅力，而林肯的外表丝毫没有吸引人的地方，那张蜡黄的脸庞布满了皱纹，充满了哀伤和忧郁。

道格拉斯穿着带有饰边的衬衫、深蓝色外套和白色裤子，头戴一顶白色的宽边帽，活脱脱一个南方种植园主。相比之下，林肯的着装便显得十分粗鄙可笑：黑外套锈迹斑斑，袖子也不够长，裤子虽然肥大，但却太短了，高耸的大礼帽经过风吹雨淋，看起来脏兮兮的。

道格拉斯一点儿幽默的天赋也没有，林肯却堪称美国历史上最为诙谐的人物。

不管去哪里，道格拉斯翻来覆去只有那么几句话，而林肯却总是不断地思考着演讲的主题，因此对于林肯来说，每天换一遍演讲词反而比重复原先的句子更容易。

道格拉斯十分虚荣，他渴望盛大的场面，渴望前呼后拥的待遇。他有一辆出行用的专列，车厢四面挂着旗帜，尾部架着一门黄铜加农炮。道格拉斯每到一个镇子，就会不断地鸣响礼炮，借此告知镇子里的人们，他这位伟人来了。

但是林肯却完全不同。他厌恶“烟火和乐队那并不悦耳的演奏”，出行只坐硬座车厢或者货运车，随身携带着一只破旧的毛毡旅行袋和一柄绿色布伞。那伞的手柄已经掉了，中间用绳子绑着，以便收住伞面。

道格拉斯是一个机会主义者，正如林肯所言，他没有“坚定的政治信仰”。他做的一切只是为了赢。赢就是他的目标。但是林肯是为了一个伟大的信仰而战，而且对他来说，现在谁赢谁输并不重要，只要最后是正义和仁慈赢了就好。

“有人说我颇有野心，”他说，“但是上帝知道，我是多么真挚地祈祷根本没有这场与野心相关的竞争。我承认自己并非对身份和荣耀毫不动心，但是今天，如果《密苏里妥协案》可以恢复，如果那在‘宽容’的土壤上滋长的奴隶制可以被取代，如果各州能坚定地抵制奴隶制的蔓延，如果能这样，我由衷地支持道格拉斯法官继续任职，我愿意有生之年永不上任。

“其实，我和道格拉斯法官不管谁当上美国参议员，都没有什么大的影响。但是今天我们呈现在诸位面前的问题，远远超越了个人利益和个人的政治前途。而且这个问题会一直存在下去，甚至当我和道格拉斯法官那无力而脆弱的豪言壮语跟着我们一起沉睡在坟墓中时，这个问题仍会继续存在。”

在这次的一系列辩论中，道格拉斯仍旧坚持主张各州在任何时候都要拥有保留蓄奴的权利。他认为，只要一个州的绝大多数公民愿意采纳奴隶制，那么这个州就有权利蓄奴。而对于各州对奴隶制的投票结果，他显然并不在意，正如他那著名的标语所说：各州管好自己的事情，不要管邻居的事。

林肯的立场与他截然相反。

“道格拉斯法官认为奴隶制是正确的，”他解释道，“但我认为它是错误的。而这一点，正是我们进行辩论的根本原因。

“他声称公众如果想要奴隶制，那就有权拥有它。如果奴隶制本身没有错，那么这个说法是成立的。但是如果奴隶制本身是不对的，那他就不能说人们有权利去做一件不对的事。

“他不关心一个州是奴隶制还是自由州，就像不关心他的邻居是在他的农场种烟草还是放牧。但是广大民众的想法与道格拉斯法官不同，他们认为奴隶制在道德上是一个极大的错误。”

道格拉斯在全国各地游说，时不时地指责林肯支持黑人享有平等地位。

“事实并非如此，”林肯回击道，“我对黑人的态度是，如果你不喜欢黑人，那就不要去管他。如果上帝能给予他们的只有这么多，那就让他们享受那些少得可怜的东西。黑人和我在很多方面都是不可比的，但他们和我，和道格拉斯法官，和每一个活着的人一样享有‘生命、自由和追求幸福’的权利，享有吃上自己挣来的面包的权利。”

在一次次的辩论中，道格拉斯指责林肯想要白人“与黑人拥抱、通婚”。

对此，林肯一次又一次地被迫否认：“请不要曲解我的话。我说不想要黑人女子做奴隶，并不代表我想要黑人女子做妻子。我活了五十年，从来没让哪个黑人女子做奴隶或妻子。这个世界上有足够多的白人男子可以和白人女子结婚，也有足够多的黑人男子可以和黑人女子婚配，看在上帝的分上，让他们就这样结婚吧。”

道格拉斯总是采取回避和迂回的战术。对此，林肯说道格拉斯的论据单薄得就像是“饿死的鸽子煮的汤”一样毫无用处，还说他善用“华而不实的文字游戏颠倒是非，指鹿为马”。

“针对这些根本算不上论据的论据进行辩驳，”林肯说，“让我觉得自己像一个傻子。”

道格拉斯并没有说真话，他知道这一点，林肯也知道。

“如果一个人，”林肯回应道，“一定要屡次三番地站出来表示二加二并不等于四，那我又能怎么办呢？我没法将自己的论据变成抑制言论的工具。我又不能堵上他的嘴。我其实并不愿意称道格拉斯法官为骗子，但是经过接触，我不知道除此之外还能怎么称呼他。”

就这样，两人之间的论战一周接着一周地持续着，林肯也日复一日地继续攻击道格拉斯。很多人卷入了这场论战。李曼·特朗布尔（Lyman Trumbull）公开称道格拉斯是骗子，谴责他是“有史以来最厚颜无耻的人”。著名的黑人演说家弗雷德里克·道格拉斯（Frederick Douglas）也来到了伊利诺伊州，加入了攻击道格拉斯的行列。布坎南派的民主党人也对道格拉斯大肆诋毁，恶语相向。德裔美国革命家卡尔·舒尔茨（Carl Schurz）也在外国选民面前言辞激烈地控诉道格拉斯。共和党的报纸则声嘶力竭地在大标题上称其为“伪造者”。现在的道格拉斯可谓四面楚歌，不仅党派内部四分五裂，还要艰难地以寡敌众。他绝望地给好友亚瑟·林德（Usher F. Linder）发电报。他说：“我的面前站着地狱恶犬，看在上帝的分上，林德，快来帮我打败他们。”

电报操作员将这份电报的副本卖给了共和党，于是它上了二十种报纸的头条。

道格拉斯的敌人们开心地尖叫了起来。从那天起直至死亡，这封电报的收件人都被戏称为“看在上帝的分上林德”。




选举当晚，林肯留在电报局观看投票统计结果。当他看到自己落选时，便默默地回了家。那晚下着雨，天色漆黑。回家的那条路坑坑洼洼，十分湿滑。突然，林肯身体一晃，两只脚绊在了一起，但他很快恢复了平衡。“只是绊了一下，”他说，“并没有摔倒。”

不久之后，他在一份伊利诺伊州的报纸上看到了一篇关于自己的社评。文章说：

毫无疑问，尊敬的亚伯拉罕·林肯先生是伊利诺伊州所有试图出人头地的政治家中最不幸的一个。他在政治上尝试的所有事，似乎都注定是失败的。他的政治计划屡试屡败，如果换作别人，早就支撑不下去了。

在与道格拉斯辩论时，大批的群众涌去听林肯的演讲，因此林肯认为自己可以通过演讲赚一些钱。因此他准备了一篇名为《发现和发明》的演讲，在布卢明顿租了一个报告厅，雇了一位年轻女士在门口卖票——但是没有一个人来，一个也没有！

于是，他再一次回到了那间昏暗的、墙壁上沾着墨水渍、书架顶部长着野草的办公室。

他也该回去了。他离开了六个月，分文未赚，还用完了存款。他现在连去肉店和杂货店结账的钱都拿不出。

因此，他再一次给“老公鹿”套上挽具，坐上那辆摇摇晃晃的单座马车，再次奔驰在原野上，辗转于各个乡村法庭之间。

当时是十一月，寒潮即将来临。野雁大声悲鸣，越过灰白色的天空向南飞去。惊慌的野兔在路上乱窜，树林里的狼大声地号叫着，但是马车里那忧郁的人儿对外面的一切都充耳不闻。他只是默默地赶路，头垂在胸口，陷入了沉思，心中充满了绝望。

一八六〇年春，新组建的共和党在芝加哥召开会议，提名总统候选人。当时，几乎没有人能想到亚伯拉罕·林肯还能有机会参加竞选。因为就在不久前，他在给一位报社编辑的信中说道：“老实说，我觉得自己根本不适合当总统。”

当时，大家普遍认为最有可能获得提名的是英俊的纽约州人威廉·苏华德（William H. Seward）。对于这一点，几乎没有人有异议。代表们在前往芝加哥的火车上举行了一次意向投票，结果苏华德的票数是其他候选人票数总和的两倍。在许多车厢里，林肯一票也没有。很多代表大概根本不知道有林肯这个人。

大会召开那天正好是苏华德五十九岁生日，多巧啊！苏华德对自己获得提名很有把握，并打算将此作为自己的生日贺礼。他非常自信，甚至提前和参议院的同事们告别，并邀请密友们前往纽约州的老家奥本参加盛大的庆功宴。他还租了一门加农礼炮，放在家中前院，填上炮弹，炮口朝天，随时准备将当选的喜讯告诉全镇的人。

如果大会如期在周四晚上举行投票，那么这门礼炮一定能物尽其用，而美国历史也会就此改变。但是投票议程却未能顺利进行，因为缺少计票用的纸张。而那位送纸的印刷员，大概是在去大会的路上喝了点酒，总之是迟到了。因此周四晚上，大会上的所有代表只能坐着干等，什么也不能做。

当晚蚊子猖獗，会议室中十分闷热，代表们又饿又渴。于是有人站出来鼓动大家将会议延期至第二天上午十点。要求延期总是合乎程序的，总是优先于其他请求的，也总是受欢迎的。这一次的延期要求，引起了一阵欢呼。

会议推迟了十七个小时。这段时间不算长，但足以打碎苏华德的美梦，将林肯推上总统的宝座。

让苏华德美梦破碎的幕后推手是霍勒斯·格里利（Horace Greeley）。他长相怪异，脑袋圆得像个甜瓜，头发稀疏，如丝绸般光亮，但又白得像白化病人一样。他系着蝶形领结，可领结总是移位，一不小心便移到了左耳下方。

格里利实际上并不拥护林肯，但他心中对威廉·苏华德和苏华德的经理人瑟洛·威德（Thurlow Weed）充满了怨恨，并下定决心报仇雪恨。

他们之间的积怨是这样的：他曾与苏华德和威德并肩作战十四年，他帮助苏华德成了纽约州州长和国会参议员，而威德能成为美国政界大佬并守住地位，也多亏了他提供的巨大帮助。

而格里利又从这些奋斗和战争中得到了什么呢？除了不被重视，几乎没有其他收获。他曾想做州印刷官，威德却自己坐上了那个位子。他想做纽约市的邮政局长，威德却没有推荐他。他渴望成为州长，或者副州长，可是威德不仅拒绝了他，还深深地伤害了他，让他的心中满是怨怼。

终于，格里利忍无可忍，给苏华德写了一封长信。这封信足以占据这本书七页的篇幅，它的每一段都充满了跃然纸上的苦涩与痛苦。

那封信是一八五四年十一月十一日周六晚上写的，现在是一八六〇年，那复仇的机会，格里利已经等待了六年。终于，机会来了，而他也充分地利用了这次机会。在那个关键的周四晚上，在共和党提名大会休会期间，格里利彻夜未眠。从傍晚至凌晨，他奔波在各个代表团之间，晓之以理动之以情地游说着代表们。他主编的报纸《纽约论坛报》遍布整个北方，对舆论导向有绝对的影响力。他本身就是一个名人，不管走到哪里，人们都能安静地听他说话，因此代表们也充满尊重地听取了他的意见。

他列举了各种苏华德不会成为美国总统的论据。他指出苏华德曾不断地攻击共济会，并表示苏华德之所以能在一八三〇年当选参议员，靠的就是反对共济会人士的支持，而苏华德本人也因此招来了持久而广泛的怨恨。

后来，在担任纽约州州长期间，苏华德又同意废除公立学校基金，同时还主张为外国人和天主教徒另设学校。这一举动无异于捅了马蜂窝，一时间又惹了一身腥。

格里利还指出，曾经强大的无知党(4)的元老们强烈反对苏华德，宁愿投票给色鬼也不愿投给他。

格里利的说辞远不止这些。他表示，苏华德是一个非常激进的“别有用心的煽动者”，周围的州都害怕他提出的“血腥计划”和制定高于宪法的法律的言论，因此也绝不会支持他做总统。

“我可以把那些州的州长竞选人带来，”格里利承诺道，“他们可以证明我所言非虚。”

格里利说到做到，而那些州长候选人的情绪也非常激动。

宾夕法尼亚州和印第安纳州的州长候选人握紧了拳头，双目喷火地宣布如果苏华德参加总统大选，他们州绝对不会支持，苏华德在他们州注定惨败。

而共和党认为，若想赢得总统大选，必须拿下这些州。

于是突然间，支持苏华德的声潮平息了下来。与此同时，林肯的朋友们也奔走在各个代表团之间，试图说服那些反对苏华德的代表支持林肯。他们是这样说的：民主党肯定是道格拉斯当选，而在这个世界上，除了林肯，大概没人有能耐与道格拉斯一战了。对于林肯来说，对战道格拉斯不是什么新鲜事，他早就顺手了。另外，林肯出生于肯塔基州，因此他定能拿下那些摇摆不定的边界州。除此之外，林肯是那种符合西部胃口的候选人——一个从劈木条、垦荒地一路爬上来的候选人，一位懂得民间疾苦的候选人。

当这些说辞并不奏效的时候，林肯的团队改变了策略。他们以承诺迦勒·史密斯（Caleb B. Smith）进入内阁为条件，拿下了印第安纳代表团。他们向宾夕法尼亚代表团承诺让西米恩·卡梅隆（Simeon Cameron）成为林肯最得力的助手，从而赢得了其五十六张支持票。

周五早晨，投票开始了。四万位代表怀着激动的心情涌入了芝加哥。一万人进入了会议大厅，另外三万人挤满了大厅外面的角落。

在第一轮投票中，苏华德暂时领先。但在第二轮投票中，宾夕法尼亚州将其五十二张选票投给了林肯，打破了原先的僵局。到第三轮投票时，林肯已势如破竹。

会议大厅内那一万人十分疯狂，他们跳上椅子，大声地叫嚷着，扯下帽子就往旁边人身上扔。屋顶传来了加农礼炮的轰鸣声——街上的三万人齐声欢呼起来。

人们互相拥抱，高兴得手舞足蹈。他们欢笑着、尖叫着，眼中涌动着激动的泪水。

特里蒙特饭店响起了一百声枪鸣以示庆贺,喜庆的钟声不绝于耳。火车、轮船和工厂也开始鸣笛庆祝这一不同寻常的日子。

这场狂欢整整持续了二十四个小时。

对此，《芝加哥论坛报》是这样写的：“自耶利哥之墙坍塌后，世上便再也没有过这般喧嚣了。”在一片喜庆中，霍勒斯·格里利看到了往昔的“总统制造家”瑟洛·威德流下了苦涩的泪水。终于，格里利复仇成功了。

与此同时，春田市又是怎样的情形呢？那天早上，林肯像往常一样去了办公室，打算研究一个案子。可是他十分焦躁，根本无法集中注意力。没过多久，他便收起了手头的法律文件离开了办公室。他在一家店铺后面投了会儿球，接着又玩了几把台球，最后去看《春田市日报》，等候竞选的消息。电报办公室在楼上。林肯坐在楼下一张大扶手椅中，与人讨论着第二轮投票的情况。突然间，电报操作员冲下了楼梯，大声喊道：“林肯先生！你被提名了！你被提名了！”

林肯的下嘴唇微微颤抖着，脸色因激动而泛着红光。有那么几秒钟，他甚至忘记了呼吸。

这是他一生中最激动人心的瞬间。

在凄凉的失败里挣扎了十九年后，林肯突然间冲上云霄，来到了令人眼花缭乱的胜利的顶端。

激动的人群在街上横冲直撞，叫嚷着这一天大的新闻。市长下令鸣枪一百下以示庆贺。

林肯的旧友们蜂拥至他的身边，又哭又笑，握着他的手，将帽子抛入空中，极度兴奋地喊叫着。

“抱歉了，伙计们，”林肯恳切地说道，“第八大街上还有一个小女人等着听这个消息呢。”

林肯疾奔而去，衣服的后摆在身后飘荡。

那一晚属于狂欢的人群——焦油桶和木围栏燃烧而发出的火光将春田市的大街小巷染上了一层玫红色，各家的酒馆也彻夜未歇。

没过多久，半个美国都在唱这首歌：

老亚伯·林肯从荒野中来，

从荒野中来，从荒野中来，

老亚伯·林肯从荒野中来，

来到了伊利诺伊州。

在林肯入主白宫的道路上，史蒂芬·道格拉斯做出了旁人无法比拟的贡献，因为他分裂了民主党，还让三个候选人参加竞选，一下子就分散了民主党的战斗力。

由于对方阵营存在严重分歧，林肯在选举初期就知道自己会获胜，但是他却担心也许拿不下自己的家乡。某个委员会在选举之前挨家挨户地做了一次民意调查，希望能了解春田市人的投票倾向。当林肯看到调查结果时，他震惊了：除二十三名牧师中的三个人和神学院的学生外，其他人都反对林肯，他们的众多追随者也都反对他。对此，林肯苦涩地说：“他们表面上信仰上帝，是敬畏上帝的基督教徒，可在投票的时候，他们显然并不在乎奴隶制的去留。但是我很清楚，上帝是在乎这件事的，人类也一样。所以如果他们不在乎，那只能说他们的《圣经》都白读了。”

令人吃惊的是，林肯父亲那边的亲戚也都没投票给林肯，母亲那边的亲戚只有一个人将选票给了林肯。为什么会这样？因为他们都是民主党人。

就得票数而言，林肯在全国得到的选票并不多，而他对手的得票数约是他的一倍多。林肯的胜利是一场区域性的胜利，因为他获得的两百万张选票中，只有两万四千张来自南方。也就是说，二十张选票里只要有一张发生变化，西北地区就会落入道格拉斯囊中，选举也会落入众议院之手，那样的话，南方就赢了。

在南方的九个州中，没有一张共和党的选票。想想看，亚拉巴马州、阿肯色州、佛罗里达州、佐治亚州、路易斯安那州、密西西比州、北卡罗来纳州、田纳西州和得克萨斯州，所有这些州中没有一个人投票给亚伯拉罕·林肯。这是一种多么坏的局面啊！

为了更好地理解林肯当选后发生的事，我们必须回顾一下那场如飓风般席卷了北方的运动。三十年来，一个执着于摧毁奴隶制的狂热组织一直在努力挑起战争。在这期间，他们的出版机构源源不断地印刷着各种言辞尖刻的宣传册和书籍；他们出钱请人在北方的每一座城市、乡镇和村庄里进行演讲，向听众展示给奴隶穿的肮脏破烂的衣服，捆绑奴隶的铁链和手铐以及各种折磨奴隶的工具，例如血迹斑斑的鞭子和竖着尖刺的项圈；他们劝说逃出来的黑奴跟着他们在国内巡游，鼓动黑奴煽动性地控诉自己的亲身经历或者亲眼所见的各种暴行。

一八三九年，美国反奴隶制协会出版了一本名为《美国奴隶制的现状——一千名目击者的真实述说》的小册子。在这本小册子中，目击者们叙述了他们亲眼所见的各种暴行：将黑奴的双手浸在沸水中；用烧红的铁块在黑奴身上刻下烙印；打落黑奴的牙齿；用刀捅黑奴；让猎犬咬下黑奴的肉；将黑奴鞭打至死；将黑奴绑在桩子上烤。痛苦的母亲们只能眼睁睁地看着自己的孩子被夺走，装进专门安置奴隶的围栏中，然后拿去拍卖。女奴若生不出更多的孩子，就要承受鞭刑。身强力壮的白人男子若和黑人妇女同居，就能得到二十五美金的补贴，因为黑白混血儿可以卖更好的价钱，尤其是女孩。

废奴主义者在谴责奴隶制时最喜欢用的一个词就是“种族混淆”。他们谴责南方人之所以保留奴隶制，只是为了满足自己“放荡的淫欲”。

“南方，”文德尔·菲利普斯（Wendell Phillips）控诉道，“就是一个大妓院，在皮鞭下，五十万妇女被迫卖淫。”

在废奴主义者的宣传册中，还记载了很多恶心得甚至不能在这里描述的淫乱故事。他们谴责南方佬和自己的混血女儿通奸，然后再把她们卖给其他男人做情妇。

史蒂芬·福斯特（Stephen S. Foster）声称南方的卫理公会中有五万黑人妇女在鞭子的淫威下过着不道德的生活。他还说，南方卫理公会的牧师们之所以支持奴隶制，唯一的原因便是他们也想有姘头。

而林肯也在与道格拉斯的辩论中说道，美国在一八五〇年有四十万五千七百五十一名黑白混血儿，他们几乎全是黑奴和其白人主人的孩子。

由于宪法保护奴隶主的权益，废奴主义者称宪法为“与死神签订的盟约，与地狱达成的协议”。

后来，某位穷困潦倒的神学教授的妻子在自家餐桌上写了一本名为“汤姆叔叔的小屋”的小说，致使废奴文学达到了顶峰。这位夫人饱含深情地描述着她的故事。她一边写，一边为人物悲惨的命运而哭泣。最后，她说是上帝写成了这个故事。这本小说首次将奴隶的悲惨生活真实地搬上了文学舞台，它打动了数百万读者的心，其销售量和影响力远超有史以来的任何一部小说。

当林肯见到这本书的作者哈里特·比彻·斯托（Harriet Beecher Stowe）时，他称她为引起了大战的小女人。

而这一场北方废奴主义者发动的虽出自善意但太过狂热的运动最终结果如何呢？他们让南方人认识到自己的错误了吗？恰恰相反。这场运动的效果也许你已经想到了——仇恨只会引起更多的仇恨。面对废奴主义者们的仇视，南方人打算和那些粗鄙又无礼的批评家划清界限。真理从来就是淹没在政治和充满情绪化的行为中的，因此在南北区域分界线的两边，涌现了很多血淋淋的悲剧。

当“黑人的共和党”在一八六〇年推选林肯竞选总统时，南方人深信奴隶制已到了穷途末路，而他们也到了必须在废奴和脱离联邦之间做出选择的时刻。为什么不脱离联邦呢？他们就没有独立的权利吗？

这个问题反反复复地辩论了近半个世纪，很多州都曾威胁说要脱离联邦。例如，一八一二年第二次独立战争时期，新英格兰州就曾严肃地表示要成立独立的国家。康涅狄格州州议会也通过了一项法律，声称“康涅狄格州是一个主权独立的自由国家”。

就连林肯本人也曾认为各州有脱离联邦的权利。他曾在国会的一次演讲中说：“任何地方的人民，只要他们愿意并且有能力，就有权利站起来脱离现有的政府，成立一个更适合他们的新政府。这是一项珍贵而神圣的权利，我们希望这项权利可以解放全世界。这项权利并不局限于我们现存政府的人民，所有人都可以行使这项权利，只要他们有能力，就能揭竿而起，占据属于自己的一块土地。”

这些话是林肯在一八四八年说的，现在已是一八六〇年，这时的林肯已不再认同这种观点。但是南方人对此仍是深信不疑，因此林肯当选六周后，南卡罗来纳州便颁布了一项“分离条例”。查尔斯顿城大肆地庆祝新的“独立宣言”，军乐高奏，人们点燃了篝火和烟花，在大街上欢快地跳舞。紧接着，又有六个州加入了分离的队伍。就在林肯离开春田市准备前往华盛顿的前两天，南方各州成立了一个新的国家，推举杰佛逊·戴维斯（Jefferson Davis）为总统。这个国家的建国理念基于一个“伟大的真理”——黑人生来就是要做奴隶的。

即将离职的布坎南政府人心涣散，面对这一局面没有采取任何措施去阻止。因此，林肯只能无助地被迫在春田市待了三个月，眼看着联邦四分五裂，眼看着共和国在毁灭的边缘步履蹒跚，眼看着南方联盟购买枪支，建造堡垒，训练士兵。这时林肯意识到，必须通过内战，一场痛苦血腥的内战，才能领导人民走向未来。

为此，林肯非常沮丧，夜不能寐。他因忧思过虑，体重掉了四十磅。

林肯是一个迷信的人，相信梦境和某些端倪能预示未来发生的事件。在一八六〇年当选后的第二天下午，林肯回到家，倒在毛纺沙发里。他的对面是一个带旋转镜的五斗橱。他看着镜子，只见里面映出了他的身影，但却有两张脸，其中一张脸色惨白。他吓了一跳，立刻站了起来，镜中的幻影便立刻消失了。他又躺了下来，那张如幽灵般的脸又出现了，比上一次更加苍白。这件事困扰着林肯，在他的脑海中挥之不去。他将这件事告诉给了自己的夫人。他的夫人确信这是一种征兆，预示着他将获得连任，但那张苍白的脸又预示着他活不到第二任任期结束。

很快，林肯便坚定地认为他去华盛顿是去送死。他收到了大量的恐吓信，里面画着绞架和匕首，威胁要取他性命。




当选后，林肯对朋友说：

“我在担心怎么处理房子。我不想卖了房子后连个落脚点都没有，但是如果租出去的话，等我回来的时候，肯定是一塌糊涂。”

最后，他找到了一个他觉得能好好照顾并且维修房子的人，以每年九十美金的价格租给了对方。然后他在《春田市日报》上刊登了这样一则广告：

第八大街和杰克逊大街拐角处的住宅，全面出售家具，包括客厅和卧室的全套设施，地毯、沙发、椅子、衣柜、书桌、床架、炉灶、瓷器、女王陶、玻璃杯等。欲购买者，速来面谈。

邻居们纷纷赶来，有人买了几张椅子和一个炉灶，有人问了床的价钱。

“想拿什么就拿什么，”林肯大概是这样说的，“觉得值多少钱就付多少钱。”

结果，邻居们的出价低得可怜。

大西北铁路公司的负责人蒂尔顿（L. L. Tilton）买下了林肯的大多数家具，随后带去了芝加哥，最后这些家具被毁于一八七一年的大火之中。

林肯的这些家具，有几件留在了春田市。数年后一位书商尽其所能地买下了这些家具，将它们送往华盛顿，安置在了林肯去世时的公寓里。那座公寓位于福特剧场对街，现属美国政府，是一座博物馆，也是人们纪念林肯的圣地。

而那些林肯的邻居以每把一点五元美金的价格买回来的二手椅子，现在的价值已远远超过同等重量黄金或者铂金的价格。林肯触碰过的每一样私人物件，都充满了荣耀和价值。林肯在遭布斯枪杀时坐的那张黑色胡桃木摇椅在一九二九年卖出了两千五百美金的价格。最近公开拍卖的一封林肯任命约瑟夫·胡克将军（Major-General Hooker）为波多马克军团总指挥官的亲笔信更是卖到了一万美金的价格。布朗大学收藏的林肯在战时发送的四百八十五封电报现估价为二十五万美金。最近，林肯的一份未签名的、某场不知名演讲的讲稿卖出了八千美金的价格。而林肯亲笔写的葛底斯堡演说的讲稿，其拷贝版也卖到了几十万美元。

而在一八六一年，春田市的人们并不知道林肯有多大的才干，也不知道他命中注定会成为怎样的存在。

多年来，未来那位伟大的总统每天早晨都会挎着篮子，围着领巾，走上街头，去杂货店和肉店购买日常所需，然后带着东西回家。多年来，林肯每天晚上都要去小镇边上的牧场，在牛群中找到他的奶牛，赶着牛回家，然后挤奶，喂马，清洗马厩，砍柴，将柴火放在厨房的炉灶里。




在动身去华盛顿的三个星期前，林肯开始准备自己的就职演说。他将自己锁在了一间杂货铺楼上的房间里，心无杂念地工作着。他自己没什么书，但他的律所合伙人却有着丰富的藏书。于是林肯让赫恩登给他拿了一些资料，包括宪法副本、安德鲁·杰克逊（Andrew Jackson）的《关于州对联邦法令废止的公告》（Proclamation against Nullification）、亨利·克莱（Henry Clay）在一八五〇年的伟大演说以及韦伯斯特的《答海恩书》。就是在这样昏暗肮脏的环境中，林肯写出了那篇著名的第一次就职演说词。在演说结尾，林肯向南方各州发出了令人动容的恳求：

我不愿结束这篇演说。我们是朋友，不是敌人。我们决不能成为敌人。尽管目前的形势有些紧张，但却不能使我们之间亲密的情感纽带断裂。记忆的神秘之弦，从每一个战场和爱国者之墓伸展开来，在这宽广的国土上与每一颗搏动的心房、温暖的壁炉联结起来，当我们本性中的更为美好的天使去再次触摸琴弦——这必会发生，我们仍将陶醉于联邦大合唱之中。

离开伊利诺伊州之前，林肯特意去了七十英里外的查尔斯顿城与继母告别。他像以前一样叫她“妈妈”，她紧紧握着他的手，一边抽泣一边说：“亚伯，我不希望你去竞选总统，我也不希望看到你当选。我总觉得你身上会发生不好的事，将我们生死相隔，直至在天堂重聚。”

在春田市的最后一段日子里，林肯总是想起以前在新塞勒姆村的日子以及安·拉特利奇。他再次梦到了那早已远去的如梦似幻的曾经。在动身前往华盛顿的前几天，一位新塞勒姆村的拓荒者赶来和他告别，他们说了很多关于安的事。“我深爱着她。”林肯说，“即便是现在，我也时常想起她。”

永久离开春田市的前一晚，林肯最后一次去了他那脏兮兮的办公室，处理了一些事务。对此，赫恩登是这样回忆的：

在处理完这些事情后，他走到了屋子的另一边，躺在了墙边的旧沙发上。这张沙发用了很多年，早已破旧不堪，只能靠着墙才能站稳。他躺了一会儿，面朝天花板，我们俩谁也没有说话。过了一会他问我：“比利，我们在一起多长时间了？”

“十六年了。”我说。

“这么多年来，我们从来没红过脸，是吧？”

我激动地回答道：“是的，确实没有。”

他又回忆了一些早年做律师时的一些事情，兴致勃勃地描绘着在巡回办案时遇到的那些稀奇古怪的案子……他收拾了一捆书，大概是想带着离开，然后便准备走了。离开前他提了一个奇怪的要求，让我别拆楼下用生锈的链子挂着的名牌。“别动它，就这样挂着吧，”他特意压低声音说道，“要让我们的客户明白，即便做了总统，林肯和赫恩登的律师事务所还在。如果我能活着回来，我们就继续开律师事务所，就好像什么事都没发生一样。”

他又逗留了一会儿，似乎想最后再看一眼这个旧住处，然后穿过门，走入狭窄的走廊。我陪着他下楼。一路上他说了总统办公室周围那些令人不悦的地方。“我已经厌倦公务了。”他抱怨道，“一想到之后会面对的事务，我就忍不住颤抖。”

林肯当时的身价可能值一万美金，但他没什么现金，因此不得不向朋友借钱前往华盛顿。

林肯一家在钱纳里旅馆度过了在春田市的最后一周。出发前一晚，行李被搬到了旅馆大堂。林肯亲自将行李捆好，问服务员拿了一张旅馆的卡片，在背面写上“华盛顿特区，白宫，亚伯拉罕·林肯收”，然后将卡片钉在了包裹上。

第二天早上七点半，一辆老旧的巴士开到了旅馆门口，林肯一家上了车，一路摇摇晃晃地前往沃巴什车站。去往华盛顿的专列早已在那里等候。

那天下着雨，天色昏暗，车站的月台上却挤着一千多位赶来送行的人。他们都是林肯的老邻居，排成了一列长队，慢慢地向林肯移动，一一握住林肯那干瘦的大手。最后，列车鸣笛，是时候要上车了。林肯踏上台阶，走进了自己的专属车厢，但一分钟后，他又出现在了车厢后的平台上。

林肯本不打算发表演说。他对记者们说，用不着来车站，因为他没什么要说的。然而，在分别关头，他看着那些老邻居的脸庞时，觉得自己必须要说些什么。那天早上他在雨中说的那些话，虽然不能和葛底斯堡宣言相比，也不如第二次就职宣言来得庄严又引领人心，但却像《大卫赞美诗》一样优美，其蕴含的情感和忧伤，比林肯的其他演说都要澎湃。




林肯一生中只有两次在演讲时忍不住哭了出来。那天早晨便是其中一次：

“我的朋友们：没有人能体会我现在心中对离别的感伤。对于这个地方，对于你们这些善良的人，我感激不尽。我在这里住了二十五年，从一个青年变成了一个老头子。我的孩子们在这里出生，其中一个更是葬在了这里。我现在离开，不知道何时才能回来，也不知道能否再回来。我要完成的任务，比当年华盛顿面临的还要艰难。若不能像华盛顿一样得到上帝的眷顾，我是无法成功的。有了上帝的眷顾，我便不会失败。相信主吧，他会在我身边，也会在你们身边。他无处不在，他让我们坚定信心，满怀希望。我将你们托付于他，也希望你们能在祷告中为我祝福。就此别过。”





17


在林肯前往华盛顿就职的途中，美国特勤局和私家侦探们发现了一场计划在林肯经过巴尔的摩时暗杀林肯的阴谋。

得知这一消息后，林肯的朋友们恳求他放弃之前公布的行程，并且在晚上匿名进入华盛顿。

这样的做法听起来十分懦弱，林肯很清楚，如果他这样做，势必会引起暴风雨般的嘲讽。因此，林肯断然拒绝了。但是，经不住身边那些值得信任的顾问数小时的恳求，林肯同意秘密进入华盛顿。

林肯夫人听说行程变动后，坚持要与林肯一起走。当她得知自己必须乘坐下一班火车时，她非常生气，大声抗议，差点儿没把计划泄露出去。

根据公开的行程，林肯将在二月二十二日在宾夕法尼亚州的哈里斯堡发表演说，然后住一晚，第二天启程前往巴尔的摩和华盛顿。

他按照行程在哈里斯堡发表了演说，但却没有在那里住宿。当晚六点钟，他溜出了酒店大门。为了隐藏行踪，他穿了一件破旧的外套，戴了一顶自己从不会戴的软羊皮帽。他被送上了一辆没有点灯的火车车厢，几分钟后，引擎旋转起来，带着他直奔费城。与此同时，哈里斯堡的电报线全部被切断了，以防企图杀死林肯的刺客收到消息。

在费城，为了更换火车和车站，他的人不得不等一个小时。为了防止林肯在这段时间内被认出来，名侦探阿兰·平克顿（Allan Pinkerton）和林肯一起坐上了一辆没有灯光的出租车，在市区的街道上穿梭。

十点五十五分的时候，林肯从侧门进入了车站。为了不让人注意到他的身高，林肯一路弯腰靠在平克顿的手臂上。他低着头，拉紧旅行披肩，将脸埋在披肩里，顺利地穿过候车室，来到列车最后一节卧铺车厢的尾部。平克顿的一位女助手事先已将这段车厢用布与前段隔开，声称是为自己的“残疾弟弟”准备的。

林肯收到过很多恐吓信，声称不会让他活着进入白宫。陆军总司令温菲尔德·斯科特将军（Winfield Scott）担心林肯会在就职演说中遭遇袭击——事实上，人们都是这样认为的。

华盛顿的很多人都不敢去参加典礼。

因此，斯科特老将军在林肯预备发表就职演说的国会大厦东面门廊处安排了六十名士兵，另外还派兵从后方守卫总统和前来聆听演讲的观众。典礼结束后，新总统踏上一辆马车，经由宾夕法尼亚大道往回走。林肯的马车受到了严密的保护，路边站满了拿着明晃晃的刺刀的步兵，路旁的大楼里也布满了身着绿色制服的狙击手。

当林肯最终活着到达白宫的时候，很多人都觉得不可思议。

自然也有人深感失望。




早在一八六一年之前的好几年，整个国家的经济就已一片萧条，情况十分严重，政府不得不派出部队驻守纽约市，以防饥饿的暴民闯入国库。

在林肯就职的时候，华盛顿聚集着成千上万个憔悴又绝望的失业者。他们希望能得到一份工作，因为他们知道第一次执政的共和党肯定会第一时间解雇掉所有民主党的公务员，即便是一周拿十美金的小职员也不会放过。

可以说，每一个工作岗位都有大量的应聘者争夺，因此林肯进入白宫还不到两个小时，便被这些人包围了。他们在大厅穿梭着，挤在走廊里，占据了整个东房，甚至还想进入私人客厅。

乞丐们也来了，向林肯讨一顿午饭钱。还有一个乞丐求林肯给他一条旧裤子穿。

有一个寡妇也来求助林肯，因为如果她能给自己的男人找一份养家糊口的工作，那个男人就答应娶她。

还有好几百人是来找林肯签名的。一位开寄宿公寓的爱尔兰妇女来白宫的目的是恳求林肯帮她收回一位公务员在她那里欠下的食宿费。

一旦有公务员病倒了，便会冒出来几十个求职者。他们恳求林肯，“如果那个家伙死了”，就把岗位给他们。

每个人都带着推荐信，但是林肯连其中的十分之一都不可能看完。有一天，两个争夺同一个邮局岗位的求职者各拿着厚厚一捆推荐信交到林肯手里。林肯只好将两个包裹放在天平上，将职位给了材料更重的那个人。

总有几十个人天天往白宫跑，要林肯给他们工作。当林肯拒绝时，他们便破口大骂。这些人中很多是劣迹斑斑的懒汉。有一位妇女代替丈夫来谋工作，因为她的丈夫喝得太醉了，无法自己来。

他们肮脏的自私本性和永不满足的贪欲让林肯大开眼界。他们在林肯出去吃午饭的路上拦截他。当林肯坐在马车里穿过街道时他们跳上他的马车，拿出学历证书乞求工作。即便是在林肯当选总统一年后，内战也已开始十个月后，这些暴民仍旧缠着林肯不放。

“他们会有罢休的一天吗？”林肯感慨道。

这些求职者疯狂的攻击曾逼死了扎卡里·泰勒总统（Zachary Taylor），当时他上任还不到一年半的时间。哈里森总统也因这种事忧思过虑，上任四周便去世了。但是林肯不得不一边忍受求职者们的进攻，一边领导一场内战。终于，纵使林肯再体格健壮，也在巨大的压力下病倒了。他感染上了天花。他说：

“让所有的求职者都来吧，现在我有样东西可以给他们所有人。”

林肯入主白宫还不到二十四个小时，便面临了一个严肃的大问题。南卡罗来纳州查尔斯顿港口的萨姆特要塞中的卫戍部队基本没有供给了，因此总统需要决定是为他们提供供给，还是把他们让给南方联盟。

陆军和海军顾问向林肯建议道：“不要送食物给他们。如果你这样做，那便意味着战争开始了。”

内阁七位成员中有六位给出了同样的建议。但是林肯很清楚，如果从萨姆特撤军，就等于承认南北分离的局势，只会加快联邦瓦解。

在就职演说中林肯宣称自己已郑重地“向上帝发誓”，一定会“维护、保护并捍卫”联邦。因此他打算捍卫自己的誓言。

于是林肯下令波瓦坦号带着培根、豆子和面包前往萨姆特要塞，但是不带枪支，不带军队，不带弹药。

当杰佛逊·戴维斯得知这一消息后给博勒加德将军（Beauregard）发了一份电报，命令他若有必要，攻打萨姆特要塞。

要塞指挥官安德森少校给博勒加德将军传话，只要他愿意多等四天，卫戍部队就会因为饥饿而被迫撤军，因为他们现在只剩下一些咸肉可以吃了。

博勒加德将军为什么没有等呢？

也许是他的一些幕僚认为“除非血溅到了人们的脸上”，否则某些已经脱离联邦的州有可能会重回联邦。

而且，杀几个北方佬能增加士气，令南方联盟更加团结。

因此博勒加德将军下达了一项悲剧性的命令。四月十二日凌晨四点半，一枚炮弹呼啸着从天而降，落入了要塞围墙附近的水域，发出了咝咝的声音。

接下来，南方发起了持续三十四个小时的轰炸。

南方联盟将这一事件变成了一场社交事件。勇敢的青年男子穿着簇新的制服，时髦的交际花在码头和炮台附近散步。在交际花们的掌声中，士兵们发射出了一枚又一枚炮弹。

星期天下午，联邦的士兵投降了，交出了要塞和四桶咸肉。联邦军的船上星条旗迎风飘扬。士兵们在《洋基曲》的奏乐声中向纽约起航。

查尔斯顿城举行了为期一周的庆祝活动。人们涌进教堂，高唱《感恩曲》；群众在街上游行，在酒吧和酒馆喝酒狂欢。

从死亡人数上来看，萨姆特要塞的轰炸不算什么大事件，因为双方都没有人员伤亡。但是从它引发的一连串事件来看，很少有战役像它一样意义深远。它揭开了一场有史以来最残酷的战争——美国南北战争的序幕。

林肯下令征召七万五千人。一时间，北方刮起了一股猛烈的爱国之风，数千个会议大厅和公众广场中会议大量召开，横幅摇曳，旗帜飘扬，演说家们高谈阔论，烟火漫天绽放；男人们丢下了犁和笔，成群结队地朝飘扬着旗帜的征兵处走去。

十个星期之后，十九万新兵高唱着歌曲开始了训练：

虽然约翰·布朗的身躯在坟墓中慢慢腐烂，

但他的英灵在继续前行。

但是谁能带领这支军队走向胜利呢？当时的部队里有一位，也是唯一一位军事天才，他的名字叫罗伯特·李（Robert E. Lee）。李是南方人，但林肯还是邀请他担任联邦军的指挥官。如果当时李接受了林肯的提议，那这场战争的历程将会大不相同。有一段时间，李确实仔细考虑了林肯的提议。他曾反复思索，他曾虔诚地阅读《圣经》并跪下祈祷，他也曾彻夜在卧室踱步，希望自己能凭着良心做出正直的决定。

他和林肯在很多事情上的意见是一致的。他和林肯一样憎恨奴隶制，也早在很久之前就释放了自己的奴隶。他和林肯一样热爱着联邦。他坚信联邦才是“不朽的”，脱离联邦这一“革命”对于国家来说是一场“巨大的灾难”。

但是，他的心结在于，他是一个弗吉尼亚人，一个骄傲的弗吉尼亚人，一个将州看得比国更重的弗吉尼亚人。两百多年来，弗吉尼亚州从殖民地变成了联邦的大州，而他的祖先一直是这块土地上举足轻重的人物。他的父亲，也就是著名的“轻骑兵哈里·李”，曾帮助华盛顿追击乔治国王的军队，后来成了弗吉尼亚州的州长。他教导他的儿子罗伯特·李，要爱“州”更甚于爱联邦。

因此，当弗吉尼亚州加入南方联盟时，李便悄悄表态道：“我无法带领着一支充满敌意的军队攻击我的亲友和我的家园。我必须要分担他们的苦难。”

李将军的这个决定，将南北战争大概拉长了两三年。

所以现在林肯又能向谁求助呢？温菲尔德·斯科特将军是当时的联邦军总指挥。但是斯科特将军已经年迈。他曾战功赫赫，在一八一二年的战争中取得了著名的伦迪巷战役的胜利，但是现在已是一八六一年了。四十九年过去了，如今的温菲尔德将军，不管是身体还是头脑，都早已不复当年。他那年少时的进取心和勇气也早已被消磨尽。

而且，他还深受脊柱病的折磨。“三年多来，”他写道，“我不能骑马，走路一次只能挪上几步，便痛得受不了。”

除此之外，他“还受着其他毛病的折磨——水肿和头晕”。

这就是林肯此时指望着能带领军队打赢胜仗的人——一个浑身是病，本该躺在医院的水床垫上享受护士照料的老兵。

四月份的时候，林肯征兵七万五千人，服役三个月。他们的服役时间将在七月结束，因此到了六月下旬，人们心中便只有一个呼声：开战！开战！开战！

霍勒斯·格里利每天都在《纽约论坛报》的“向里士满进发”社论专栏顶部印上加粗的迎战大标题：“国家渴望战争”。

经济萧条，银行不愿提供贷款，即便是政府借款，也要支付百分之十二的高息。人们深感不安。大家都说：“听着，别再混下去了，根本不管用！我们要猛烈地进攻，抓住李的军队，干净迅速地永远结束这个混乱的局面。”

这样的论调听起来十分动人，人们也都相信事实就是这样。

但军方却并不这么认为，他们知道军队还没有准备好。但是总统拗不过民众的呼声，终于下令开战。

于是，在七月明媚的一天，麦克道尔（McDowell）带着他的三万大军出发，向驻扎在弗吉尼亚州的布尔朗溪的联盟军发起了攻击。在那个时候，还没有哪位在世的将领指挥过这么庞大的军队。

但是，那是一支怎样的部队啊！没有战斗经验，缺乏训练。有好几个团的士兵报到还不满十天，毫无纪律性可言。

“我拼尽了全力，”旅长谢尔曼说，“但根本管不住他们。他们掉队取水，摘黑莓，想做什么就做什么。”

当时，法国朱阿夫兵和阿尔及利亚士兵是强者的象征，于是很多联邦军人学习他们的穿着打扮和行为举止。结果在这支向布尔朗溪行进的军队中，好几千人头上戴着红色的头巾，腿上穿着肥大的红色马裤，看上去像是一群滑稽剧团成员，而不是向死亡进发的勇士。

几名戴着丝绸礼帽的众议员开着车来观战。他们带着太太和宠物狗，还有数篮三明治和波尔多酒。

就是这样，在七月底某天上午十点钟，南北战争的第一枪打响了。

结果怎么样呢？

那些毫无经验的士兵一看见加农炮弹在树林间爆炸，向前冲的同伴们口吐鲜血倒在地上，再加上耳旁传来的阵阵尖叫声——一看到这些，宾夕法尼亚军团和纽约炮兵团的士兵们顿时想起自己三个月的服役期已满，立刻要求退役。他们四处逃窜，速度快极了。据麦克道尔报告，他们“一听到敌军的炮声就往后方跑了”。

剩余的部队坚持到了下午四点半。他们表现出出乎意料的勇猛。突然间，联盟军加派了两千三百名士兵加入战斗，如风暴般席卷了战场。

士兵之间互相喊道：“约翰斯顿的部队打过来了！”

军队陷入了恐慌。

两万五千名士兵拒绝服从命令，疯狂地逃离战场。麦克道尔和其他指挥官竭尽全力阻止士兵溃败，但毫无作用。

很快，南方军的炮弹落在了街道上。马路上乱成了一团，挤满了四处逃窜的士兵、运送补给的马车、救护车和戴着丝绸礼帽观光的众议员。女人们尖叫晕倒，男人们骂骂咧咧，互相踩踏。马车翻倒在桥上，整条公路都堵塞了。狂躁不安的马儿在马车、救护车和炮弹间穿梭。头裹红色头巾、身着黄色裤子的男人们跃上马背仓皇出逃，马具拖在马儿身后，扬起了漫天的尘土。

他们以为南方军近在咫尺，“骑兵！骑兵！”的叫喊声把他们吓得浑身颤抖。

大溃败中的人们成了一群惊恐万状的暴徒。

美国以往的战场上从来没有发生过这种事。

疯狂的人们扔掉了枪支、外套、帽子、皮带和刺刀，不管不顾地逃命，就好像后面有什么看不见的东西追着一样。有些人累极了倒在路上，成了后面车马之下的亡魂。

那天是星期天，林肯坐在教堂里。从二十英里外传来了加农炮的轰隆声。一做完礼拜，他便奔到美国陆军部查看从战场传来的电报。虽然这些信息很零散，也不完整，但林肯还是希望能和斯科特将军讨论一二，于是他赶去了将军的住处，却发现斯科特在打盹。

斯科特将军醒了，打了个哈欠，揉了揉眼睛。可他实在太羸弱了，靠自己根本起不来。“他在房间的天花板上安了马鞍式的滑轮带，他抓着吊带，将自己庞大的身躯摆成垂直状，然后摇动滑轮让自己的脚离开躺椅站在地上。”

“我不知道，”他说，“有多少人在战场，在哪个战场，装备如何，能力如何，我都不知道。没有人和我说，我一无所知。”

说这话的人，正是联邦军的指挥官！

这位年迈的将军看了几眼来自战场的电报，告诉林肯没什么可担心的，然后嚷嚷着背疼，接着就又睡着了。

午夜时分，毫无秩序可言的败兵越过横跨在波托马克河上方的长桥，涌入了华盛顿。

华盛顿的街道旁迅速搭起了餐桌，面包也不知从哪里运来了。上流社会的妇女们站在煮着热汤和咖啡的大锅旁边分配着食物。

麦克道尔累极了，手中的电报写到一半就握着铅笔在树下睡着了。士兵们累得无暇考虑任何事，倒在人行道上就睡着了。他们躺在细密的雨中，一动不动，就像死人一样，但手里仍紧紧地握着步枪。

那天晚上，林肯一直从夜里坐到次日黎明。他倾听着新闻记者和戴着丝帽的市民们讲述他们亲眼所见的战况。

很多公众人物也陷入了恐慌。霍勒斯·格里利确信南方联盟是不可战胜的，因此要求林肯无条件停战。

伦敦的银行家们也认为联邦迟早会瓦解，于是他们在华盛顿的代理人在周日下午冲进了财政部，要求美国政府立刻为向他们借的四万美金提供抵押。

财政部让代理人周一再来，并告诉他美国政府仍旧希望能在旧约定的前提下继续合作。

对于林肯来说，失败并不新鲜。他一生都在与失败打交道。但是失败并未压垮他，而他也仍旧坚信自己的事业最终一定能成功。他去看望灰心丧气的士兵们，与他们握手，一遍又一遍地对他们说：“上帝保佑你！上帝保佑你！”林肯为士兵们打气，和他们坐在一起吃豆子，鼓舞士气，向他们描述着灿烂的未来。

林肯已经认识到，这将是一场持久的战争。他要求国会征兵四十万，但结果只征到了十万。同时国会给予林肯三年内征兵五十万的权力。

但是由谁来领导这些士兵呢？那个年迈到已走不动路，要靠马鞍和滑轮带才能起床，整个下午只会睡觉的斯科特将军吗？肯定不行，他半只脚都在棺材里了。

在这种情况下，有史以来最迷人也最令人失望的将军出现在了公众的视线中。

林肯的麻烦远没有结束。一切才刚刚开始。





19


在开战的前几周里，一位英俊的名叫麦克莱伦（McClellan）的年轻将军带着二十门加农炮和一台手提印刷机挺进了西弗吉尼亚。他打败了几支南方军。战役并不大，只能算是小规模冲突，仅此而已。但这是北方军的首次胜利，因此显得十分重要。麦克莱伦也认识到了这点，于是他利用自己的手提印刷机匆忙发送了几十份夸大其词的捷报，宣扬自己对国家的贡献。

如果是在几年后，他这种小丑般的荒唐行径肯定会被人们狠狠地嘲笑，但当时战争刚刚开始，人们仍处于迷茫之中，因此迫切地希望能出现一位领军人物。就是在这种情况下，这位满口空话的年轻军官得到了人们的信任和追捧。国会通过决议向他表达了感谢，人们将他称作“新一代拿破仑”。尤其在布尔朗溪战役失败后，林肯便请他去了华盛顿，并任命他为波托马克军团的总司令。

麦克莱伦天生具备做将军的风采。当他骑着白色的战马在营地疾驰而过时，他的将士们便会爆发出阵阵掌声。此外，他工作认真尽责。他接管了在布尔朗溪战役中被残虐的部队，认真操练他们，恢复了将士们的自信，大大提升了部队的士气。在这类事情上，无人能出其右。等到了十月，他已拥有了一支不管是人数还是能力都数一数二的军队。他的将士们不是为了战斗被动接受训练，而是从内心渴望战斗。

全军上下每个人都摩拳擦掌，跃跃欲试——除了麦克莱伦。林肯不断地敦促他派兵出击，但他却不行动。他进行阅兵，高谈阔论自己的计划，然后便永远止步在谈论阶段。

他不断拖延出兵时间，找尽了理由，就是不去前线打仗。

有一次他说之所以不能出兵，是因为部队在休整。林肯便问他，部队到底做了什么事需要休整。

安提塔姆河之战后还发生了一件奇事。当时麦克莱伦的部队比李的人数多，于是他顺利地打败了李，而李也给了他追击的机会。这本是一个很好的机会，如果乘胜追击，很可能虏获李的军队，然后结束战争。一连几个星期，林肯一直在催促他追击李将军。林肯给他写信，发电报，甚至还派了特使，但麦克莱伦仍不行动。最后麦克莱伦说他追不了，因为他的战马疲惫不堪而且患了舌疮病。

如果你去过新塞勒姆村，你便会看到林肯曾工作过的奥福特杂货店和山坡之间有一片洼地。“丛林男孩”常在那里举行斗鸡比赛，林肯做裁判。一连几个星期，巴布·麦克纳布（Bab McNab）一直在吹嘘自己有一只健壮的公鸡，可以打败桑加蒙郡所有的对手。但是当这只家禽最终被放入斗场时，它却掉转了尾巴拒绝战斗。巴布气坏了，一把抓起公鸡往天上扔去。公鸡落在了旁边的一堆柴火上，只见它抖了抖羽毛，挑衅地叫了几声，大摇大摆地走了。

“混账东西！”麦克纳布骂道，“你只会摆样子阅兵，让你上战场就完蛋。”

林肯说，麦克莱伦让他想起了巴布·麦克纳布的公鸡。

在半岛战役期间，马格鲁德将军带着五千将士拖住了麦克莱伦的十万大军。麦克莱伦不敢出击，只会躲在防御工事后面，然后不断要求林肯增兵，增兵，增兵。

“如果我会变魔术，”林肯说，“再派十万人给他，他会十分高兴，他会感谢我，然后答应我明天就能到达里士满。但是等到了明天，他又会给我发电报，说得到了确切消息，敌军有四十万，如果没有援军他无法向前挺进。”

“如果麦克莱伦有一百万兵力，”战争部长斯坦顿说，“他肯定会发誓说敌军有两百万军队，然后坐以待毙，向你要三百万人。”

“新一代拿破仑”的名声是轻而易举得来的，它像香槟一样灌满了他的脑子。他极度自大，形容林肯和其内阁是“卑劣的人”、“可怜虫”、“一群蠢材”。

麦克莱伦一直都看不起林肯。有一天林肯去看望他，他竟让总统在前厅等了半个小时。

还有一次，当麦克莱伦在晚上十一点踏进家门时，仆人告诉他总统先生已经等了他几个小时了。结果麦克莱伦从林肯坐着的房间门前经过，看也没看林肯一眼便上了楼，然后派人传话说自己已经睡了。

这类小事经过报纸的添油加醋，很快在华盛顿流传开来，成了总统的丑闻。总统夫人泪流满面地恳求总统将“那个满口空话的人”撤职。

“孩子他妈，”林肯说，“我知道他做得不对。但现在这种时候，我不应该考虑自己的感受。只要麦克莱伦能带领我们走向胜利，给他拿帽子我也愿意。”




夏去秋来，秋去冬来，很快就要开春了。麦克莱伦除了继续操练士兵、阅兵和夸夸其谈之外，什么都没做。

全国上下怨声载道，而林肯也因为麦克莱伦的不作为而受到了来自全国各地的批评和谴责。

“你的拖延会毁了我们。”林肯愤怒地喊道。随后林肯正式下达了进攻命令。

麦克莱伦只有两个选择：要么进攻，要么辞职。于是他匆忙赶往哈珀渡口，然后命令军队立刻跟上。他打算通过切萨皮克和俄亥俄运河将船只运来，之后渡过波托马克河，在那个位置进入弗吉尼亚。但是在最后时刻，这个计划还是流产了，因为船身比运河闸门宽了六英寸，无法过河。

当麦克莱伦告诉林肯因为没有准备好浮桥所以计划失败时，忍耐力十足的总统终于发火了。他用印第安纳州鸽子溪的乡间方言骂道：“真是见鬼了！为什么没有准备浮桥？”

整个国家也用相同的口吻质问着相同的问题。

终于，在四月份的时候，“新一代拿破仑”像当年的拿破仑一样在将士们面前进行了一次庄严的战前动员演讲。他和十二万将士一起高唱着《我把心爱的姑娘留在了后方》，然后终于出发了。

当时，战争已开始一年了。麦克莱伦放出大话，说自己很快就能收拾好残局，让士兵们及时回家种晚玉米和小米。

虽然听起来难以置信，但林肯和斯坦顿确实过于乐观地估计了形势。他们给各州的州长发电报，叫他们不用再征召志愿兵，还让他们关了募兵处，卖了这些机构的公共财产。

腓特烈大帝有这样一句作战格言：“了解你正在对战的人。”李和斯通沃尔·杰克逊（Stonewall Jackson）非常了解这位“懦弱的拿破仑”——胆小谨慎，只会抱怨，并且因为见不了血而从没上过战场。

于是李将军故意让麦克莱伦花了三个月慢慢爬向里士满。当时，麦克莱伦和目标只有咫尺之遥，他的将士们甚至能听见里士满教堂里传来的钟声。

就在此时，精神振奋的李将军向麦克莱伦发起了一系列猛烈的攻击。李只用了七天便逼退了麦克莱伦的炮火，并消灭了对方一万五千人。

于是，这场用麦克莱伦的话说“异常惨烈的战斗”就这样结束了，并成了战争史上排得上号的大败仗。

但是，和以往一样，麦克莱伦将一切过错指向“华盛顿内的奸细”。故事很老套：华盛顿方面没有给他足够的兵力，他们的“懦弱和愚昧”让他的士兵们“血流成河”。他憎恨林肯和内阁，甚至超过了憎恨南方联盟。他谴责他们的行为是“历史上最臭名昭著的恶行”。

实际上，麦克莱伦的部队人数比敌人多得多——通常都是如此，只是他不知道该如何调兵遣将而已。他只是一味地要求增兵，越多越好，先要求增兵一万，接着是五万，最后变成十万。但是根本没有那么多增兵。他知道这点，林肯也明白他知道这点。林肯告诉他，他的要求“荒唐无稽”。

麦克莱伦给斯坦顿和总统的电报言辞犀利，充满了侮辱性的词语，就像一个疯子的胡言乱语。他谴责林肯和斯坦顿费尽心机毁掉他的部队。那些极端的措辞甚至让电报操作员拒绝发报。

全国都震惊了，华尔街一片慌乱，整个国家都陷入了绝望。

林肯日益憔悴。“在这个世界上，”他说，“还有谁比我更伤心欲绝呢？”

麦克莱伦的岳父，也就是参谋长马西（P. B. Marcy）说，为今之计除了投降别无他法。

林肯听说后气得满脸通红。他将马西喊来，说：

“将军，我听说你说到了‘投降’这个词。但是这个词不应该和我们的军队有任何关系。”





20


林肯早在新塞勒姆村的时候就知道，租一间房，堆满东西，开一间杂货铺是简单的，但不管是他还是那个整日醉醺醺的合伙人，都不具备使它赢利的能力。

在连年的失望和杀戮中，林肯注定会明白，征召五十万甘愿为国捐躯的士兵不难，为他们配备一亿美金的枪支弹药和物资也不难，难的是找到一个能带领他们走向胜利的领袖型人物。而这样的人，林肯现在根本找不到。

“军事上的胜利，”林肯愤愤地喊道，“关键还是要有优秀的将领。”

因此林肯一次又一次地跪地祈祷全能的主给他一个像罗伯特·李或者约瑟夫·约翰斯顿（Joseph E. Johnston）或者斯通沃尔·杰克逊一样的将军。

“杰克逊，”林肯说，“是一位勇敢诚实的长老会(1)战士。北方军只有在这样的将军带领下，才能不让国家继续承受如此多的苦难。”

但是在整个北方联军中，到哪里去再找一个斯通沃尔·杰克逊呢？没有人知道。埃德蒙·克拉伦斯·斯特德曼（Edmund Clarence Stedman）为此发表了一首著名的长诗。这首诗的每一节末尾都重复着同样的恳求：“亚伯拉罕·林肯啊，快给我们一个将军吧！”

这句恳求不仅是一首诗歌中的叠句，更是流着鲜血、忧心如焚的整个国家的呼唤。

总统在读到这首诗时，不禁潸然泪下。

两年来，他竭尽全力地寻找这个国家所期盼的将领，但现实总是那么残忍：他任命了一位将军，结果数万将士徒劳牺牲了，留下了一万或三万或四万无依无靠的寡妇和孤儿悲伤哀泣。然后这位丢脸的将军被撤职，换了另一位“干将”。这位同样愚蠢的将军说自己尽力一试，结果又白白牺牲了一万士兵。收到战报的林肯穿着晨衣和拖鞋，彻夜在房间里踱步，一遍又一遍地哭着说：

“上帝啊！国民们会怎么说呀！上帝啊！国民们会怎么说呀！”

接着，林肯只能再任命一名指挥官，然后继续眼睁睁地看着将士们牺牲。

有一些军事评论家甚至认为，麦克莱伦虽然犯下了惊世骇俗的错误并且有明显的能力缺陷，但是相比之下可能是波托马克军曾有过的最好的将领了。可想而知其他的将领有多么糟糕！

麦克莱伦失败后，林肯尝试着任命约翰·波普（John Pope）为将领。波普在密苏里有着十分不错的战绩。他曾擒获数千俘虏，还占领了一座岛屿。

他和麦克莱伦有两个相似之处：英俊，喜欢说大话。他宣称自己的指挥部“拥有实权”，还发表了很多夸大其词的言论，于是他被人们称作“豪言壮语波普”。

“我从西部过来，在那里我们总是能看到敌人四处逃窜的背影。”他用这样直率又毫无技巧可言的语句开始了首次对将士的讲话。接着他指责东部屯兵不动，并暗讽他们是可恶的懦夫。结尾时，他吹嘘自己一定会创造军事奇迹。

新指挥官的这番豪言壮语就像三伏天的菱背响尾蛇一样令人厌恶，因此将士们都不喜欢他。

麦克莱伦对他的憎恨是十分强烈的。他很清楚波普是来取代自己的，所以他早就写信提出希望在纽约获得一个新的职位，但他仍然怒火中烧，心中满是愤恨与嫉妒。

波普带军进入弗吉尼亚，一场大战即将来临。他需要所有能调动的兵力。于是林肯给麦克莱伦发送了大量的电报，要求麦克莱伦以最快的速度带兵赶去援助波普。

麦克莱伦会遵守林肯的命令吗？当然不会。他辩解，拖延，抗议，寻找各种借口，甚至还召回了先前派出的兵力。他“挖空心思阻止波普得到支援”。“就让波普先生，”他轻蔑地说，“自己解决这破事吧。”

即便后来他耳中传来了南方军连天的炮火声，他仍旧不派一兵一卒去援助自己讨厌的竞争对手，尽管他手握三万大军。

因此李将军在布尔河再一次大获全胜。波普的军队败得彻底，伤亡十分惨重。联邦军的士兵们再一次仓皇而逃。

布尔河的故事再一次上演了：又是一大批流着鲜血的残兵败将涌入了华盛顿。

李带着他的胜利之师乘胜追击，当时就连林肯也认为首都守不住了。炮艇在河面上摆开了阵势。华盛顿的所有职员——平民也好，政府官员也好——都拿起了枪准备保卫首都。

战争部长斯坦顿惊恐万分，发电报给六个州的州长，恳求他们立刻用专列将所有的民兵和志愿兵送来保护华盛顿。

酒吧关门了，教堂里响起了钟声，人们跪倒在地上，恳求万能的上帝拯救他们的城市。

老人、妇女和儿童惊恐地四处逃窜，街道上回响着慌乱的马蹄声以及匆忙向马里兰逃去的马车声。

斯坦顿准备将政府迁到纽约去，下令拆除军械库，并将所有武器装备运到北方。

财政部部长蔡斯（Chase）紧急命令将全国的金银搬迁至华尔街的国库分库。

此时的林肯疲倦而气馁，时而咆哮时而呻吟道：

“我该怎么办？我该怎么办？釜底抽薪，一切都完了。”

人们认为麦克莱伦这么做是为了报复，因为他早就想看到波普战败以及他的军队溃不成军。

甚至林肯也因此将麦克莱伦叫到白宫，告诉他全国人民都骂他是卖国贼，因为他想要看到华盛顿沦陷和南方获胜。

斯坦顿的愤怒如风暴般暴虐，他的眼中闪动着愤恨的火光。见到他这副模样的人都说，如果麦克莱伦走进战争部的办公室，斯坦顿一定会冲过去一拳将他击倒。

蔡斯更为凶狠。他说自己不会打麦克莱伦，因为这种人应该被拉去枪毙。

虔诚的蔡斯并非只是打个比方。他是真的希望看到麦克莱伦被蒙上眼睛，背靠着石墙，然后任由一打子弹穿过他的胸膛。

可是林肯有着如耶稣一样的胸怀，生性体谅他人，因此他并没有怪任何人。是，波普是失败了，但是他就一点儿过错都没有吗？林肯自己也遭遇过数不清的失败，因此很难因为失败而怪罪他人。

他将波普派去西北镇压苏族印第安人的反叛，让麦克莱伦重新执掌军队。林肯为什么这么做？因为——用林肯自己的话说——“在整顿军队方面，我们的部队里没有人比他更有才华。他虽然不能打仗，但至少能让军队处于良好的备战状态。”林肯很清楚自己会因为恢复了“小拿破仑”的职位而饱受各方谴责。事实也确实如此——林肯受到了强烈的谴责，甚至他的内阁也提出了反对意见。斯坦顿和蔡斯宣称他们宁愿华盛顿被李攻陷，也不愿看到麦克莱伦这个叛国的跳梁小丑重新获得军队的指挥权。

狂风暴雨般的反对声让林肯十分受伤，他甚至表示，如果内阁同意，他愿意立刻辞职。

几个月后，当麦克莱伦在安提塔姆河之战后没有听从林肯的命令追击攻打李时，他再一次失去了指挥权，而他的军旅生涯也就此永远地结束了。

波托马克大军需要新的指挥官。但是这个人是谁呢？他现在在哪里？谁也不知道。

绝望之下，林肯将指挥权交给了伯恩赛德（Burnside）。伯恩赛德并不适合这个职位，他自己也很清楚这一点，因此拒绝了林肯两次。当他最终被迫受命时，他哭了。他集结军队，迅速地向李在弗雷德里克斯堡的防御工事发动攻击，损失了一万三千人。士兵们毫无意义地挥着刺刀，因为他们根本看不见任何获胜的希望。

军官和士兵们开始大量逃亡。

于是伯恩赛德被换了下来，军队落入了一个人称“斗士乔·胡克”的大话王手中。

“愿上帝垂怜李，”他自吹道，“因为我不会手下留情。”

他带领着那支他自称“全世界最精良的部队”和李对阵。他手里的军队是南方军的两倍，但仍被李在钱斯勒斯维尔战役中消灭了一万七千人。

这是南北战争中北方军伤亡惨重的一次重大败仗。

这场战役发生在一八六三年五月。据林肯的秘书回忆，在那几个可怕的夜晚，他听到总统一边彻夜在房间里来回踱步，一边哭喊着：“完了！完了！一切都完了！”但是第二天，他就赶到弗雷德里克斯堡慰问军队，给“斗士乔·胡克”打气。

将士们无谓的牺牲让林肯受到了来自各方的口诛笔伐，整个国家都笼罩在忧伤和失望之中。

除了军事上的打击，没过多久，林肯的家庭也受到了重创。林肯非常疼爱自己的两个幼子泰德和威利。夏天的时候，他常在晚上溜出来陪儿子们玩一种叫“镇球”的游戏。他从一个垒跑到另一个垒，燕尾形的衣摆在他身后随风飘动。有的时候他会和儿子们一起玩弹珠，一路从白宫跑到战争部。晚上的时候，他喜欢和孩子们一起在地板上打滚。天气好的时候，他就会从白宫后门出去，和两个孩子以及他们的两只山羊一起玩耍。

只要有泰德和威利在，整个白宫就像吟游诗会般热闹非凡。他们时而组织仆人进行军事训练，时而在应聘者中穿来穿去。如果哪位应聘者入了他们的眼，便能立刻见到“老亚伯”。即便无法从正门进去，他们也能带着应聘者从后门溜进去见林肯。

他们和爸爸一样对规矩和繁文缛节不是十分在意。有一次他们冲进了内阁会议，只为告诉总统爸爸地下室的猫生小猫崽了。

萨蒙·蔡斯也曾被他们惹得十分不悦。当时蔡斯正在和林肯讨论国家所面临的重大财政问题，而泰德却旁若无人地爬到爸爸身上，一路向上爬至爸爸肩膀，然后两脚分开骑在林肯的脖子上。

有人送了威利一匹小马，威利十分喜欢，不管多冷的天气都会出去骑马。有一天他外出骑马时被淋湿了，得了风寒，回来就病倒了。威利很快便发起了高烧，于是林肯一夜又一夜地守在儿子床头。当可怜的小家伙最终去世时，林肯哽咽地哭喊道：

“我可怜的孩子！我可怜的孩子！一定是他太美好了，不适合生活在这个世界，所以上帝要喊他回去。眼睁睁地看着他死去，这真的是太痛苦了。”

凯克利夫人当时也在房间里。她说：

他将头埋在手掌中，颀长的身躯因悲伤而颤抖着……林肯夫人看到儿子那苍白的脸庞后浑身抽搐起来。她悲伤得不能自已，甚至连葬礼都没有出席。

威利去世后，林肯夫人根本不能看到他的照片。凯克利夫人告诉我们：

她根本不能看到任何威利曾喜欢过的东西，连一朵花也不行。人们给她送来昂贵的花束，她却浑身打战地避开，要么将花束放在她根本不会踏入的房间里，要么扔到窗外。她把威利所有的玩具都送人了……威利死后，她再也没有踏入过威利死时待过的会客室和威利的尸体入殓化妆的休息室。

在极度的悲伤下，林肯夫人找来了一位打着“科尔切斯特神灵”旗号的所谓的巫师。后来，这位彻头彻尾的骗子败露了，被勒令离开华盛顿，否则就会面临牢狱之灾。当时，悲痛不已的林肯夫人在白宫接待了这位“科尔切斯特神灵”，并将他带到了一间黑暗的房间里。林肯夫人听到了一些类似刮护墙板、拍墙和敲桌子的声音，并在巫师的引导下相信这些是死去的儿子传递给她的讯息。

她一边接收着这些讯息，一边失声痛哭。

被伤心压垮的林肯萎靡不振地陷入了绝望之中，几乎不能正常地处理政务。未回复的信件和电报在他的办公桌上堆积成山。他的医生担心他无法从悲伤中恢复过来，担心他就此被忧思压垮，一蹶不振。

总统有的时候会坐下来对着秘书或者副官大声朗读几段文章，一读便是数个小时。通常他读的都是莎士比亚的文章。有一天，他对着副官朗读《约翰国王》，当他读到康斯坦丝（Constance）悼念死去的儿子的那一段时，林肯合上了书，依记忆背诵出了那一段：

主教大人，我曾听你说，

我们会在天堂与亲友重逢。

如果这是真的，

我将与我的孩子重聚。

“上校，你梦到过去世的朋友吗？”总统问道，“在梦里你是否能感受到他们的音容笑貌，但是又隐隐知道这只是梦？我经常像这样在梦里见到我的威利。”说完，林肯便伏在桌子上哭起来。

当林肯着手处理内阁事务时他才发现，内阁和军队一样，充满了嫉妒和争斗。

国务卿苏华德称自己为“总理”。他总是斥责其他内阁成员，干预他们的事务，从而引起了众人的怨恨。

财政部长蔡斯看不起苏华德，厌恶麦克莱伦将军，憎恨战争部长斯坦顿，不愿意与邮政总局局长布莱尔共事。

布莱尔，按照林肯的说法，则是到处“踢翻马蜂窝”，并吹嘘自己只要“参与了斗争”，就意味着“参加了对方的葬礼”。他谴责苏华德为“没有原则的谎言家”，并拒绝与之共事。至于斯坦顿和蔡斯，他甚至不愿屈尊和这两个“无赖”说话——甚至在内阁会议上也是如此。

布莱尔的仇家太多了，这最终断送了他的政治生涯。他招致了大范围的不满和仇恨，因此林肯不得不要求他辞职。

内阁中处处充满了仇恨。

副总统汉尼拔·哈姆林（Hannibal Hamlin）不和海军部长吉迪恩·威尔斯（Gideon Welles）说话；而戴着精心制作的假发、蓄着大片白色络腮胡的威尔斯有写日记的习惯。他日记中的每一页都写满了对几乎所有同事的“嘲笑和蔑视”。

威尔斯特别讨厌格兰特、苏华德和斯坦顿。

而至于那个暴力又傲慢的斯坦顿，他几乎是内阁成员中最记仇的。他讨厌蔡斯、威尔斯、布莱尔和林肯夫人，乃至世界上所有的人。

“他根本不考虑别人的感受，”格兰特这样说道，“拒绝别人给他带来的快乐远超过接受别人。”

谢尔曼恨极了斯坦顿，曾当众在阅兵台上给他难堪，并在十年后写回忆录时仍对此津津乐道。

“我向斯坦顿走去，”谢尔曼说，“他向我伸出手，我当众拒绝了。这件事很多人都看到了。”

很少有人比斯坦顿更招人恨。

几乎所有的内阁成员都认为自己比林肯强。

毕竟，要他们听令于他的这个毫无教养、只会讲故事的西部拓荒者是个什么玩意儿？

林肯只是一个意外，一匹偶然得势、偶然在他们之间脱颖而出的“黑马”而已。

司法部长贝茨在一八六〇年曾对自己获得总统提名抱有很大的希望。他在日记中说共和党提名林肯是犯了一个“重大的错误”，因为林肯“缺乏意志力和目标”，“也没有指挥的才能”。

蔡斯也曾希望取代林肯获得提名，而且在生命尽头时他仍旧认为林肯“软弱可欺”。

苏华德心中也充满了怨恨。“失望？你来和我谈失望？”有一次苏华德一边在房中踱步一边大声地对一位朋友喊道，“本该是我合法获得共和党总统候选人的提名，结果却只能被迫站在一边，眼睁睁地看着一个伊利诺伊州的小律师抢走我的东西。

“你来和这样的我谈失望！”

苏华德很清楚，若不是霍勒斯·格里利，他肯定能成为总统。他知道怎么去经营一些事情，因为他已有二十年的从政经验。

但是林肯有什么资历？他在新塞勒姆村的时候经营了一家小木屋杂货店，最后还亏损得一干二净。

哦，对了。他还经营过一家邮局，一家塞在帽子里的邮局。

这便是那位“来自草原的政治家”所有的从政经验了。

而现在他坐在白宫里，犯了大错，却一筹莫展地任凭事情随意发展，任凭整个国家在通向深渊的坡道上快速地下滑。

苏华德认为——成千上万的人也同样认为——自己当选国务卿就是为了统治整个国家的，因为林肯是一个有名无实的总统。人们称苏华德“总理”，他对此欣然接受。他认为拯救美国的重任落在了他的肩上，只落在了他的肩上。

“我会尽力，”他在接受任命的时候说，“拯救自由和我的国家。”

林肯上任还不到五个星期的时候，苏华德便向林肯提交了一份十分放肆的备忘录。不仅如此，这份备忘录还明显带有侮辱性质。美国历史上还没有哪位内阁成员敢向总统提交如此放肆又自大的文件。

“我们执政已经快一个月了，”苏华德说道，“但却没有制定出任何国内或者对外政策。”接着他以一种高人一等的态度指责那位曾经的新塞勒姆村杂货店主，并告诉他应该如何让新政府运转起来。

最后苏华德还厚颜无耻地建议从现在起林肯应该退居幕后，因为那才是他该去的地方。他还建议让精明练达的自己接管政府，这样国家才不会走向灭亡。

苏华德还大胆地提出了一项让林肯瞠目结舌的建议。苏华德对法国和西班牙最近在墨西哥的表现不甚满意，因此建议将两国领导人喊来做个解释。当然，还有英国和俄罗斯。如果“无法得到满意的解释”，你猜他打算怎么做？

没错，发动战争。对于这位政治家来说，一场战争还不够，同时发动几场战争才热闹。

他甚至准备了一份措辞自大，充满了警告、威胁和侮辱字眼的通知，准备给英国送去。要不是林肯删掉了其中极其糟糕的几段，并修改了文件中尖锐的语气，说不定真的能引发战争。

对此，苏华德吸着鼻烟公开宣称自己乐意看见欧洲力量干预南卡罗莱纳的事务，因为到了那个时候，南方诸州定会一心攘外，北方就能趁机“渔翁得利”。

而美国也确实差点儿和英国打起来。一艘北方炮艇在公海上截住了一艘英国邮船，抓住并强行带走了两名准备前往英国和法国的南方联盟官员，并把他们送进了波士顿的监狱。

英国随即进入了备战状态，并将数以千计的士兵运送至大西洋对面的加拿大，准备从那里进攻北方军。

虽然林肯承认“这是我吞咽过的最苦的药片”，但他还是迫于压力释放了那两名南方联盟官员并为此道歉。

所以苏华德那些大胆的建议着实让林肯大吃一惊。林肯从一开始就知道自己经验不足，无法独立解决他所面对的那些繁杂又棘手的事务。他需要帮助——他需要指导和智慧，因此他任命了苏华德。可是结果呢？

整个华盛顿都认为是苏华德在运营着美国政府。这些流言打击了林肯夫人的骄傲，激起了她滔天的怒火。她双眼喷火，勒令自己谦卑的丈夫发声维护总统的权威。

“凭我自己，我大概治理不好这个国家，”林肯坚定地说道，“单靠苏华德也不行。我唯一的统治手段是良心和上帝。人们迟早会知道的。”

后来，如林肯所说，所有人都看清了这点。




萨蒙·蔡斯可以说是内阁中的“切斯特菲尔德伯爵”(2)。他身高六英尺二英寸，英俊倜傥，生来便有统治者的威严，拥有良好的文化素养，是一个传统的学者，精通三门语言。他的女儿更是华盛顿上流社会中最受欢迎最美丽的贵妇。因此坦白说，当他看到白宫的主人竟然不会点菜的时候，内心是多么震惊。

蔡斯很虔诚，非常虔诚。他周日的时候要去教堂三次，洗澡的时候也在背诵《诗篇》，还在美国货币上印上了“我们信赖上帝”的箴言。他在任期间每天晚上都要读《圣经》和布道书，因此他根本无法理解总统在睡觉之前阅读幽默作家阿特姆斯·沃德（Artemus Ward）和讽刺作家彼得罗利姆·纳斯比（Petroleum Nasby）作品的行为。

令蔡斯更加气恼愤恨的是，林肯能在任何时候任何情况下表现出浑然天成的幽默感。

有一天，林肯一位伊利诺伊州的老朋友来白宫拜访林肯。门房带着挑剔的目光上下打量着这位拜访者，告诉他总统正在开内阁会议，不能见他。

“没关系，”这位拜访者坚持道，“你就告诉亚伯，奥兰多·凯洛格来了，想给他讲一个口吃法官的故事。他会见我的。”

林肯立刻把他请入白宫，并热情地和他握手，接着对内阁说：

“先生们，这位是奥兰多·凯洛格，他想给我们讲一个口吃法官的故事。这个故事非常有意思，我们先把手头的事情放一放。”

于是严肃的政客们只得将国家大事放在一边，听奥兰多讲述他的奇谈。林肯则在一旁听得哈哈大笑。

蔡斯对此深恶痛绝。他为国家的未来感到担忧。他抱怨林肯“把战争当成了玩笑”，谴责他正迅速地将整个国家带向“破产和毁灭的深渊”。

蔡斯就像参加高中联谊会的女生一样心里充满了嫉妒。他本希望自己能当国务卿，可是为什么没当成？为什么他要受冷落？为什么这项荣誉落在了傲慢的苏华德身上？为什么他只是一个财政部长？蔡斯的内心充满了苦涩和怨恨。

现在的他，只是无足轻重的三把手，但他总会让人们看到他的厉害。一八六四年快到了，这也意味着新一轮选举即将到来。蔡斯立志要在新一轮选举中胜出，成为白宫的主人。于是他心无旁骛，全身心地投入林肯称之为“蔡斯之疯狂追逐总统之位”的事业之中。

当着林肯的面，蔡斯假装是林肯的朋友。但是一旦离开了林肯的视线范围，蔡斯便成了总统的敌人，一个潜伏在暗处永不放弃又充满了怨恨的劲敌。林肯时常被迫做出一些有损某些名流利益的决定。每当此时，蔡斯便去找那位满腹牢骚的受害人，感同身受地劝解对方，告诉对方错在林肯，借此煽动对方心中的怨恨。同时他还会说，如果萨蒙·蔡斯做了总统，一定会一碗水端平。

“蔡斯就像一只红头丽蝇，”林肯说，“每个腐朽的地方都有他产的卵。”

数个月来，林肯对蔡斯的所作所为了如指掌，但他十分大度，并不在乎自己的利益。他说：

“蔡斯是一个十分有能力的人，但在做总统这件事上，我认为他有些疯狂。最近他的表现不尽如人意，于是就有人对我说‘是时候把他排挤出去了’。事实上，我不想排挤任何人。如果一个人有能力做好某一件事，那就让他去做。所以我决定了，只要他做好财政部长的本职工作，我就不会管他对白宫的那份灼热之情。”

但是情况却日益严重起来。一旦某件事情违背了蔡斯的意愿，他就要辞职。他五次提出过辞职，林肯每次都挽留他，表扬他，劝说他继续任职。但是最终，即便是坚忍的林肯也受够了。彼此之间强烈的反感情绪使得两人见面也成了不愉快的事。于是，当蔡斯再次提出辞职时，林肯接受了他的辞呈。

蔡斯十分震惊。他只是虚张声势，却被当了真。

财政委员会全体成员都赶到了白宫。他们抗议林肯的决定，认为蔡斯的离职将会是一场灾难。林肯耐心地听着，让他们畅所欲言。然后他讲述了与蔡斯共事的惨痛经历。林肯告诉他们，蔡斯只想掌权，并且对他（林肯）的权威极为不满。

“他要么一心一意想要惹恼我，”林肯说，“要么就是逼我拍着他的肩膀安抚他，然后哄着他留下来。我并不认为我应该这么做。我会满足他的要求。他的内阁生涯已经结束了。我不会让他继续留任。如有必要，我愿意立刻辞去总统的职位。我宁愿去伊利诺伊州的乡下耕地种田养活自己，也不愿再忍受之前的处境。”

而林肯对这位曾经羞辱过他的人又是如何评价的呢？“在我所知的伟人中，蔡斯比最伟大的那个还要强上一倍多。”

虽然林肯与蔡斯彼此有着强烈的反感情绪，但林肯还是做出了他职业生涯中最美好最宽容的举动。他授予了蔡斯一个美国总统可以授予的最大荣耀：他让蔡斯成了美国最高法院的首席法官。




和暴躁的斯坦顿相比，蔡斯就像是一只温顺的小猫。斯坦顿身材矮胖，体格像牛一样健壮，有着动物般的凶狠和残忍。

他一生行事鲁莽，漂泊不定。他的父亲是一名内科医生，因为希望儿子也成为医生，于是在斯坦顿常常玩耍的谷仓里挂了一具人体骨架。斯坦顿常给玩伴们讲述这具骨架、摩西、地狱之火和洪水滔天的故事。然后他去了俄亥俄州的哥伦布市，成了一名书店职员。他寄宿在一户私人家庭里，某天早上他出门后不久，这户人家的女儿便因为霍乱病倒了。斯坦顿回来吃晚饭时，那位姑娘已经躺在坟墓里了。

他拒绝相信这个事实。

他担心那姑娘被活埋了，于是匆匆赶往墓地，找了把铁锹，愤怒地挖了几个小时，终于将那姑娘的尸体挖了出来。

数年之后，他自己的女儿露西死后，他心中的悲伤无法消退，于是在女儿入土十三个月后挖出了她的遗体，并将尸体存放在女儿卧室长达一年之久。

斯坦顿夫人去世的时候，他每晚都将太太的睡帽和睡裙放在床边，对着这些遗物痛哭流涕。

他是一个很奇怪的人。很多人说他是半个疯子。

林肯和斯坦顿是在处理一件专利案件时认识的。当时林肯和斯坦顿还有来自费城的乔治·哈丁（George Harding）是被告的辩护律师。林肯对案子做了详细的研究，细致勤奋地做足了准备工作，希望能在庭审上发言。但是斯坦顿和哈丁以林肯为耻，他们忽视他，看不起他，羞辱他，不允许他在庭审上发言。

林肯将自己的发言稿抄了一份给他们，但他们觉得那是“垃圾”，看也没看一眼。

他们去法院或者离开法院时拒绝和林肯同行，不会请林肯去他们房间坐坐，吃饭的时候甚至不愿意和林肯共用一张桌子。他们像对待社会弃儿一样对待林肯。

斯坦顿说——林肯也听到了：

“我才不要和那样一只该死又蠢笨的长臂猿扯上关系。如果案子的合作律师外表上不是绅士，那我宁愿不要。”

“从来没有人像斯坦顿一样对我如此残忍。”林肯说。他窘迫地回到家，再一次陷入了深深的悲伤之中。

林肯成为总统后，斯坦顿对他的蔑视和厌恶就更深了。他称林肯是“讨厌的低能儿”，并宣称林肯绝对没有能力管理政府，还说应该换一位军事独裁者做总统。斯坦顿总是说，迪夏尤（Du Chaillu）何必跑去非洲看大猩猩，当下白宫就坐着一只抓耳挠腮的正宗大猩猩呢。

在给布坎南的信中，斯坦顿态度十分恶劣地辱骂了总统。他的言辞不堪入目得甚至都不能写入这本书中。




林肯执政十个月后，一件丑闻在全国传开了：政府被打劫了，损失了数百万美金。林肯被骂作奸商以及发战争财的骗子。

除此之外，林肯和战争部长西米恩·卡梅隆就武装奴隶问题产生了严重的分歧。

林肯要求西米恩辞职。他需要一个新的人来领导战争部。林肯知道，国家的未来也许就指望他的这个决定了。他也知道自己需要什么样的人，于是他对朋友说：

“我已决定放下所有的骄傲——或者说部分自尊，聘请斯坦顿担任战争部长。”

这个任命最后被证明是林肯任职期间做出的最为明智的决定之一。

斯坦顿站在战争部办公室的桌子前，甚是威严，使得身旁的职员们就像巴夏(3)面前的东方奴隶一样瑟瑟发抖。斯坦顿夜以继日地工作，不回家，吃住都在战争部办公室。他十分看不惯那些寄生在军队中、能力不足只会吹牛还整日游手好闲的官员，内心对他们充满了愤怒。

于是他把这些人全都开除了。

他咒骂、侮辱那些好管闲事的国会议员，炮轰不诚实的奸商，忽视并违反宪法。他甚至擅自逮捕将军，把他们扔进监狱却一连数月不进行审讯。他训诫麦克莱伦，就好像训练自己的军团一样。他勒令麦克莱伦必须出战，并发誓“定会停掉波托马克军所有的香槟和牡蛎”。他牢牢抓着铁道部，还霸占了电报线，迫使林肯从战争办公室收发电报。他确保自己对所有军队的指挥权，即便是格兰特的命令，若没有他的允许，也绝不许传到副官的办公室。

斯坦顿多年来饱受头痛、哮喘和消化不良的折磨。

但他却在信仰的驱使下像一台发动机似的永远精力充沛。他的信仰十分有意思——杀，杀，杀，杀到南方回到联邦的怀抱为止。

为了实现这个目标，林肯可以忍受任何事。

某一天，一位国会议员说服总统给他一道调令，允许他抽调几个团的兵力。这位议员拿着总统的命令冲到了战争部办公室，将调令放在斯坦顿的桌子上，可斯坦顿却断然拒绝，说自己不会做这种事。

“但是，”这位政治家抗议道，“你别忘了，这可是总统的命令。”

“如果总统给了你这道命令，”斯坦顿回击道，“那他就是一个十足的白痴。”

这位议员又冲到了林肯办公室，指望着林肯对斯坦顿勃然大怒，然后撤掉其战争部长的职务。

可是林肯知道了事情的来龙去脉后居然笑眯眯地说：“如果斯坦顿认为我是一个十足的白痴，那我一定就是了，因为他总是对的。我现在就亲自过去找他。”

林肯去见了斯坦顿。在斯坦顿的说服下，林肯也认为自己的命令是错误的，并及时撤销了调令。

林肯知道斯坦顿非常讨厌别人插手他的工作，因此总是让他照着自己的方式做事。

“我可不能再给斯坦顿先生添麻烦了。”林肯说，“他的位子是世界上最难的。军队里有数千人因为得不到晋升而责怪他，还有数千人则因为未被任命而怪罪他。他肩上的压力大得难以估量，而且不知何时才能消失。他就像伫立在国家这片海岸上的岩石，坚忍地抵挡着分裂的浪潮那无止境的冲撞和咆哮。他与怒海抗争，防止它们破坏和淹没大陆。我不知道他是如何坚持下来的，也不知道他为何没有被摧毁成碎片。但是如果没有他，我会完蛋。”

不过偶尔地，总统也会——按照他自己的说法——“坚定立场”，然后部长就得小心了。如果“老战神”说不会做某件事，林肯会平静地回答道：“我认为，部长先生，你必须这么做。”

结果斯坦顿真的做了。

有一次林肯下达了一道命令：“不要‘如果’或者‘还有’或者‘可是’，立刻将埃利奥特·赖斯（Elliott W. Rice）升为美国联邦军陆军准将——亚伯拉罕·林肯。”

还有一次，林肯写信给斯坦顿，要求斯坦顿任命一个人。林肯说“不管他是否知道恺撒头发的颜色，都要任命他”。

到了最后，斯坦顿、苏华德以及所有曾经侮辱、嘲笑过林肯的人都学会了尊敬他。

当林肯的遗体躺在福特剧场对面的公寓里时，这位曾经诋毁林肯为“讨厌的低能儿”的硬汉说：“这里躺着的，是有史以来最完美的统治者。”




林肯的秘书约翰·海（John Hay）生动地描述了林肯在白宫的工作方式：

他完全不讲究方法。尼古拉和我花了四年的时间才让他采纳了一些系统化的工作方法。规章制度刚建立起来就被他打破了。任何让民众远离他的事，他都不会同意，尽管来自民众的那些不合理的抱怨和诉求能把他气死。

他极少写信，收到信也很少阅读，五十封里也难得看一封。一开始我们总是会把信拿给他看，但最终他把信都交给了我处理。我以他的名义写好回信后，他看都不看一眼就签上自己的名字。

他大概一个星期写六封信——不会再多了。

当总统需要离开华盛顿处理棘手事务时，他基本不会写信，只会派我或者尼古拉过去。

他的作息很有规律：晚上十点到十一点睡觉，第二天起床很早。他住在郊外士兵之家那段时间，每天早早起床，穿戴整齐，吃早餐（他的早餐极为节俭：一个鸡蛋，一块吐司，一杯咖啡），然后准时在八点前骑着马到达华盛顿。冬天的时候，他在白宫不会起那么早。他睡得并不好，但却喜欢赖在床上……

冬天中午他吃一点儿饼干和一杯牛奶，夏天则吃些水果和葡萄。他非常节俭——吃得比我认识的任何人都少。

他只喝水，倒不是出于原则，只是因为他不喜欢红酒和烈酒……

有的时候他会逃去听演讲、听音乐会或者看戏，美其名曰略作休息。

他很少阅读，几乎不看报纸，除非我提醒他看某篇特殊话题的报道。他总是说：“我比他们知道得多。”说他谦虚是件很荒谬的事。所有的伟人都不谦虚。





22


如今随便找一个美国人，问他们为什么要发动南北战争，他们很可能会说“为了解放黑奴”。

真的是这样吗？

让我们探个究竟。下面这句话摘自林肯的第一次就职演说：“不管是直接还是间接，我都没有打算干预蓄奴州现存的奴隶制度。我想我没有权利干预，也不愿意这样做。”

事实上，加农炮火轰鸣，伤兵哀号了将近十八个月后，林肯才签署了《解放奴隶宣言》。在那期间，激进派和废奴派都敦促他立刻行动，他们通过媒体攻击他，还在各种公共场合诋毁他。

有一次，芝加哥牧师代表团携带着他们称为“来自上帝的命令”的东西来到白宫，要求林肯立刻解放黑奴。林肯对他们说，如果上帝真的要插手此事，肯定会亲自带着指令莅临指挥部，而不是通过芝加哥辗转发令。

最终，霍勒斯·格里利实在忍受不了林肯的拖延和不作为，写了一篇《两千万人的祈祷》来攻击总统。这篇文章洋洋洒洒地占据了两个专栏，字里行间都是强烈的怨气。

林肯针对格里利的责难进行了答复，而这篇回复文章也成了战争期间的经典作品——简洁、精练又强悍有力。而文章的结尾更是令人难以忘怀：

通过这场战争我最重要的目标既不是保全奴隶制，也不是废除奴隶制，而是拯救联邦。如果不用解放黑奴就能拯救联邦，我就不解放。如果要解放全部的黑奴才能拯救联邦，我就全部解放。如果只要解放一部分的黑奴就能拯救联邦，我就只解放一部分，不会管剩下的人。我为奴隶制和有色人种做了些事，这是因为我认为这么做有助于解救联邦。我也忍耐了很多事，这是因为我相信这么做有助于解救联邦。凡是我认为会破坏解救联邦这项事业的事，我会尽力少做；凡是我认为对解救联邦有好处的事，我会尽力多做。凡是被证明是错误的事，我都会尽力改正；凡是被证明是正确的观点，我都会立刻接受。

今天我是站在对自己所负公职的立场上陈述这个目标的。我常说我的个人愿望是愿普天之下所有人都能得到自由，而我并不想修改这个愿望。

林肯相信如果他能拯救联邦，阻止奴隶制的扩散，那么到了合适的时间奴隶制必会自然消亡。但如果联邦被摧毁了，那么奴隶制也许会留存几百年。

当时，有四个蓄奴州是站在北方这边的。林肯很清楚，如果他在冲突期间过早地签署《解放奴隶宣言》，那么势必会促使这几个州转投南方联盟，增加南方的实力。如此一来，联邦便有可能被彻底摧毁。当时流传着这样一句话：“对于上帝，林肯只是希望上帝能站在自己这一边，但对于肯塔基州，林肯却是一定要得到的。”

于是他小心谨慎，等待时机。

林肯自己的夫人便是来自一个拥有奴隶的边界州家族。林肯夫人从她父亲那儿得到的遗产中，一部分便是贩卖奴隶的收入。而林肯唯一的密友——约书亚·斯皮德——也来自蓄奴家庭。所以林肯在心里对于南方是持同情态度的。而且，林肯是律师出身，对于宪法、法律和私人财产有着本能的尊重，所以他不愿意苛待任何人。

他认为在奴隶制这个问题上，北方和南方一样负有责任。若想废除奴隶制，双方都应该承担同等责任。最终林肯想出了一个十分贴合他心意的计划。根据这份计划，效忠于北方的边界州的奴隶主们每释放一个黑奴便会得到四百美金的补偿。黑奴也不会一下子全部得到解放，这是一个循序渐进的过程，按照计划，要到一九〇〇年一月一日才能解放全部黑奴。林肯将边界州的代表们请到了白宫，恳请他们接受他的提案。

“这份提案带来的变化，”林肯据理力争道，“将会像天堂的露水一样温和，不会强势地夺取或者摧毁任何东西。这么好的提议，你们还不赞成吗？在过去那么多岁月中，还没有哪件事能带来如此大的好处。但是现在，在上帝的旨意下，你们有特权去做这样一件事。希望在以后漫长的岁月中，你们不会因为曾忽视了这份提案而追悔莫及。”

但这些代表真的忽视了林肯的提议，而且全盘否定了这份提案。林肯感到极度失望。

“如果可以的话，我将竭尽全力保全联邦，”他说，“我不妨一次把话说清楚，我决不会留着未打完的牌投降……我现在已经认识到，解放黑奴以及武装黑人同胞已成了必不可少的军事需要。我现在已被逼到了要么这么做，要么放弃联邦的地步。”

林肯必须立刻采取行动，因为英国和法国已准备承认南方联盟。为什么呢？理由很简单。

先说法国。拿破仑三世娶了特巴女伯爵玛丽·欧仁妮·德蒙蒂霍（Marie Eugénie de Montijo）。欧仁妮被誉为世界上最美丽的女人，于是拿破仑三世就想炫耀一把。他渴望和他那位举世闻名的叔叔拿破仑·波拿巴（Napoleon Bonaparte）一样满身荣耀，于是当他看到美国人自相残杀时，就料定美国人没有时间和精力继续执行门罗主义(4)，于是派了一支军队入侵墨西哥，杀了几千名当地人，占领了这个国家，将它命名为法属墨西哥，并将奥利地大公马克西米利安（Archduke Maximilian）送上了王位。

拿破仑毫无依据地相信，如果南方联盟赢了，南方定会支持他的新帝国，但若是北方联邦赢了，那么美国一定会采取措施将法国军队赶出墨西哥。因此，拿破仑希望南方能够成功分裂美国，而他也会尽力促成此事。

战争伊始，北方海军关闭了所有南方口岸，派兵驻守一百八十九个港口，巡逻九千六百一十四英里长的海岸线，监控海湾、河口和河道。

这是世界上有史以来范围最大的封锁。

南方联盟非常绝望。他们无法出售棉花，也买不了枪支、弹药、鞋、医疗用品或食物。他们只能用煮熟的栗子和棉花种子代替咖啡，用黑莓叶子和檫树根酿成的饮料代替茶。报纸只能印在壁纸上。没有盐吃，便将熏制房里的浸着培根汁液的地板挖出来，煮开提炼盐。教堂的钟熔化后制成了加农炮。有轨电车的轨道也拆了下来，制成了炮艇的装甲。

南方联盟无法维修铁路，也不能购买新设备，因此运输基本处于停滞状态。在佐治亚州一蒲式耳玉米只卖两美金，但在里士满却卖到了十五美金。整个弗吉尼亚州都处在饥饿之中。

南方必须采取行动改变这一局面。于是他们向法国提议，若拿破仑三世承认南方联盟，并为南方提供军舰解除北方的封锁，南方联盟愿意向法国提供价值一千两百万美金的棉花。此外，他们还承诺会给拿破仑三世足够多的订单，让法国每家工厂的烟囱都夜以继日地冒出滚滚浓烟。

因此，拿破仑三世怂恿俄罗斯、英国和他一起承认南方联盟。英国的统治者们调了调鼻梁上的单片眼镜，倒上一杯尊尼获加，热切地听拿破仑三世陈述他的提案。美国的日益强大、富庶让他们很不开心，因此他们希望美国分裂，联邦解体。此外，他们也需要南方的棉花。英国的很多工厂都倒闭了，上百万人不仅无业又贫穷，还沦落至需要救济的地步。孩子们哭闹着要食物，数百人被活活饿死。即便是那些最遥远的角落——印度和贫困的中国——的救助金也被抢去给英国工人买面包吃。

有一条路，唯一的一条路，可以让英国获得棉花——加盟拿破仑三世，认可南方联盟，帮助他们解除封锁。

如果这件事成了，美国会如何呢？南方会得到枪支、火药、贷款、食物和铁路设备，并极大地提高自信和士气。

那北方又能得到什么呢？两个强大的新敌人。现在的局势已然很糟，若真的到了那一天，那便毫无希望可言了。

亚伯拉罕·林肯比任何人都清楚这一点。“我们必须打出最后一张牌了。”他在一八六二年承认道，“现在要么改变战略，要么满盘皆输。”

在英国人看来，所有北美殖民地一开始都是从他们手里分割出去的。现在南方殖民地要脱离北方，而北方镇压南方，迫使南方臣服。可是对于伦敦的贵族或法国的亲王来说，田纳西州和得克萨斯州是由华盛顿还是里士满统治又有什么区别呢？没有区别。对于他们来说，南北战争毫无意义，没有崇高的目标。

“在我所处的年代，”卡莱尔写道，“没有哪场战争像南北战争这样愚蠢得这么彻底。”

林肯明白，必须改变欧洲对这场战争的态度，而他也知道该怎么做。在欧洲，上百万人读过《汤姆叔叔的小屋》。他们为黑奴的悲惨遭遇伤心哭泣，憎恨奴隶制的不公和残忍。林肯知道，如果他签署《解放奴隶宣言》，欧洲人便会用不同的眼光看待这场战争。南北战争不再是一场欧洲人眼中毫无意义的、血淋淋的联邦保卫战，而上升成了一场摧毁奴隶制的伟大变革。届时，欧洲政府便不敢承认南方，因为公众舆论不会容忍和帮助那些想要延续人性枷锁的人。

因此，一八六二年七月，林肯终于下定决心签署《解放奴隶宣言》。但是当时麦克莱伦和波普输了好几场丢人至极的战役，于是苏华德告诉总统，现在时机不对，应该等获得了一波胜利后再发布宣言。

这个建议听起来合情合理。于是林肯等待着。两个月后，北方军迎来了胜利。于是林肯召集内阁，商讨发布美国历史上自《独立宣言》后最著名的宣言。

这是一个重大的时刻，也是一个极其庄严的时刻。可是林肯会庄严肃穆地对待这件事吗？才不会呢。无论何时，只要读到了好故事，林肯就会分享给其他人。他睡前常常阅读阿特姆斯·沃德的书，当看到幽默的故事时，他便会爬起来，只穿着睡衣，穿过白宫的走廊来到秘书办公室，读给秘书们听。

在内阁召开会议讨论《解放奴隶宣言》发布事宜的前一天，林肯得到了沃德最新的一卷书。书中有一则故事让林肯觉得非常有趣。于是，在内阁成员们开始做正事之前，他便将这则故事读给他们听。这篇故事名叫《在尤蒂卡的高调愤怒》。

林肯笑够了之后才将书放在一边，肃穆地开口道：“当叛军在弗雷德里克的时候，我就决定，一旦将他们逐出马里兰，我就发表解放奴隶的宣言。这件事我没有跟任何人说，但我对自己和上帝发了誓。现在叛军已经被逐出去了，我也将实现当时的诺言。我召集你们来，是想请你们听一听我写的东西。我不希望你们修改其主体大意，因为我已经决定好了。我所写的是我思考后想说的。但是在措辞或者其他小问题方面，你们若觉得最好改掉，我会非常高兴地接受你们的建议。”

苏华德建议改动一处措辞，几分钟后，他又提出了一条新的改动建议。

林肯问他为什么不将两条建议一起说出来。随后林肯终止了对《解放奴隶宣言》的思考，讲述了一个故事。他说，印第安纳州的一个雇工告诉聘请自己的农场主，最好的两头牛死了一头。过了一会儿，雇工又说：“另外一头也死了。”

农场主问：“你为什么不一次性告诉我两头都死了呢？”

“其实，”雇工回答道，“我不想一次全告诉你，怕你会伤心。”

一八六二年九月，林肯向内阁提交了他的宣言，但这份宣言直到一八六三年一月一日才正式施行。因此在一八六二年十二月的国会会议上，林肯恳求国会支持他的宣言。在恳求的过程中，林肯说出了他曾写过的最为壮丽的话——充满了意想不到的诗意。

谈到联邦的时候，林肯说：

我们要么高尚地挽救，要么卑鄙地丧失

这地球上最后的、最美好的希望。

一八六三年元旦那天，林肯花了好几个小时与挤满了白宫的访客一一握手。那天下午晚些时候，林肯回到办公室，拿起笔蘸了蘸墨水，准备签署他的解放宣言。他犹豫了一会儿，转身对苏华德说：“如果说奴隶制不是一个错误，那就没有正确的事了。我这一生从没像现在这样，认定自己正在做一件正确的事。但是今天早上自九点钟起我就一直在接待来访者，与人握手。我的手臂现在又酸又麻。这个签名肯定是会被人仔细审视的，如果他们看出我的手抖了，他们会说‘林肯后悔了’。”

他让手臂休息了一会，然后缓缓地在文件上签上了自己的名字。三百五十万奴隶因此得到了自由。

当时，这份宣言并没有得到普遍的支持。“这份宣言的唯一效果是，”林肯的挚友及忠实拥护者奥维尔·布朗宁（Orville H.Browning）写道，“激怒了南方，让他们更加团结，同时让北方意见分歧，军心涣散。”

军队中发生了兵变。那些应召入伍誓死捍卫联邦的将士发誓绝不会拥护黑奴解放，也绝不会为了让黑奴与自己平起平坐而牺牲自己的性命。数以千计的士兵逃跑了，各地募兵处皆是一片萧条。

林肯曾获得了广大平民的支持，但他们却让林肯彻底失望了。林肯在秋季选举中一败涂地，即便是他的家乡伊利诺伊州也否定了共和党。

很快，林肯在选举失败之后又迎来了南北战争中损失最为惨重的一场战役——伯恩赛德鲁莽地在弗雷德里克斯堡攻击了李，然后损失了一万三千人。又是一场愚蠢而无用的屠戮。十八个月来，同类事件一而再再而三地上演，到底何时才是尽头？整个国家都处于惊恐之中，人们心中满是绝望。全国各地都在强烈谴责总统。林肯失败了，他的将军失败了，他的政策也失败了。人们再也忍受不了了，即便是参议院的共和党成员也生出了反叛之心。他们想把林肯赶出白宫，于是前往白宫拜见林肯，要求他改变政策并且解散内阁。

这一打击让人颜面尽失。林肯承认这是他政治生涯中最为痛苦的时刻。

“他们想要摆脱我，”林肯说，“而我内心竟然愿意满足他们。”

此时，霍勒斯·格里利对自己在一八六〇年迫使共和党提名林肯这件事感到非常后悔。

“这绝对是一个错误。”他承认道，“这是我一生中犯下的最大的错误。”

格里利和其他几位声名显赫的共和党人发起了一项运动，主要目的如下：迫使林肯辞职，让副总统哈姆林入主白宫，然后迫使哈姆林任命罗斯克兰斯接管北方联军。

“我们如今站在毁灭的边缘。”林肯承认道，“在我看来，上帝似乎也没有站在我们这边。我看不到任何希望。”





23


一八六三年春，李将军被一系列显著而非凡的胜利冲昏了头脑，意气风发地决定入侵北方。他计划先占领宾夕法尼亚州富庶的制造业中心，确保自己那些衣衫褴褛的士兵有足够的食物、药品和衣物，然后设法攻占华盛顿，接着迫使英国和法国承认南方联盟。

这是一场大胆又鲁莽的行动。南方军自大地认为，一个南方勇士抵得上三个北方佬。他们对于这一点深信不疑，于是当他们的长官告诉他们，到了宾夕法尼亚州后一天可以吃两顿牛肉时，他们恨不得立刻出发。

在离开里士满之前，李收到了家里传来的令人心烦的消息。他家里发生了一件很糟糕的大事：他的一个女儿被抓到偷看小说。这位伟大的将军非常忧虑，于是提笔给女儿写信，恳求她将自己的空余时间用在阅读经典作品上，例如柏拉图和荷马的作品，以及普鲁塔克的名人传。写完信后，李和往常一样读了会儿《圣经》，然后跪下祷告。接着他吹灭了蜡烛，上床睡觉去了。

没过多久，李率领着七万五千人出发了。这支饥饿的军队横渡波托马克河，整个国家因此陷入了惊慌。农民们驾着牛马仓皇逃出了坎伯兰山谷。黑人们眼中满是恐惧，四处逃命，唯恐再被抓回去做奴隶。

当李将军的炮火在宾夕法尼亚州首府哈里斯堡前轰隆响起的时候，李发现北方军正试图切断他的后方通讯线。于是，他就像一头愤怒的公牛一样回转枪头，想要凶狠地顶伤在他身后撕咬他的脚跟的小狗。机缘巧合之下，公牛和小狗在宾夕法尼亚州一处有着一所神学院的静谧小乡村相遇了。这个地方名为葛底斯堡，正是在这里，双方发动了美国历史上最为著名的一场战役。

在战役的前两天，北方军损失了两万人。战役第三天，李让乔治·皮克特（George Pickett）将军带领生力军向北方发起一波强攻，希望能借此彻底摧毁敌人。

这是李的新战略。到目前为止，李和他的部下都是通过躲在胸墙后面或隐藏在树林里的方式进行战斗，现在他计划在空地上发动一次猛烈的正面攻击。

李最杰出的副将朗斯特里特将军经过仔细考虑，对这个战略提出了质疑。

“上帝啊！”朗斯特里特大喊道，“李将军，你看一下这些横在我军和北方军之间的障碍——陡峭的山坡，层层的炮火，还有围墙——这些几乎是不可攻克的。即便越过了这些障碍，我们的步兵还要面对敌军的炮兵连。你看，我们的冲锋区域是一片接近一英里的开阔之地，到时我们会完全暴露在敌军的霰弹筒和弹片之下。我认为，从没有哪支一万五千人的军队攻下过这样的地方。”

但李固执己见。“那是因为那些军队里没有我们的士兵。”他回答道，“只要引领恰当，我们的士兵可以去任何地方，做任何事。”

李坚持自己的意见，于是犯下了职业生涯中最为致命的大错。

南方军已沿着神学院山脊调集了一百五十枚加农炮。如果你去葛底斯堡参观，便能看到它们仍立在原地，和那个在宿命的七月下午，发动的有史以来最为密集的火力网时的样子一模一样。

此时此刻，朗斯特里特的判断比李更准确。他认为这次出击是毫无意义的，只会血流成河，于是他低下头忍不住哭泣，拒绝发布攻击命令。结果，另外一位指挥官代替他下达了命令。在这项命令的指引下，乔治·皮克特率领着南方军进行了一场西方世界从未有过的最戏剧化、伤亡最惨烈的进攻。

有意思的是，这位带兵侵犯联邦军防线的将军，是林肯的一位旧识。事实上，是林肯促成了他去西点军校。皮克特是一个很有个性的人。他留着一头赤褐色的披肩长发，在战场上几乎每天都会写热烈的情书，就像在意大利战场的拿破仑一样。那天下午，在忠诚的士兵们的欢呼声中，他潇洒地向右边歪戴着军帽，得意扬扬地骑着马朝北方军的防线进军。士兵们兴高采烈地跟在他身后，摩肩接踵，一个阵列接着一个阵列。旌旗飘扬，一排排锋利的枪刺在阳光下闪烁着白光。这是一幕别开生面的场景，壮观又豪情万丈。北方军看到这一景象，羡慕之情在心中悄然蔓延开来。

皮克特的部队一路小跑着前进，穿过了果园和玉米地，越过了草场和山涧。一路上，北方军的炮火在他们的阵列中撕开了一个又一个可怕的口子，但他们仍旧义无反顾地带着肃穆的神情相互拥挤着向前行进。

突然，躲藏在墓园山脊石墙后的北方军步兵冲了出来。一波又一波的子弹扫向皮克特那毫无防备的大军。山顶就像喷发的火山一样满是火光，俨然已成了一片屠宰场。几分钟后，皮克特手下的旅级指挥官只剩下一名，其余都阵亡了。五千士兵死了四千人。

坎伯领军的地方，倒下了一千人，

加尼特牺牲的地方，死了一千人，

在迷人眼的火焰和令人窒息的硝烟中，

剩余的将士在枪林弹雨中冲锋，

跟着阿米斯特德冲过防线。

阿米斯特德率领军队进行最后的冲锋。他勇往直前，跃过石墙，将帽子挑在刀尖上，一边挥舞一边喊道：

“兄弟们，让他们尝尝尖刀的滋味。”

士兵们十分英勇。他们越过石墙，用刺刀疯狂地攻击敌人，用枪托敲碎敌人的头颅，将南方军的战旗插上了墓园山脊。

然而，那面战旗只飘扬了一小会儿。这短暂的一小会儿成为南方军在这场战役中的巅峰时刻。

皮克特的指挥是明智且英勇的，但却是南方战败的开始。李将军败了。他无法攻入北方，而他自己也很清楚这一点。

南方军注定要失败了。

皮克特带着被打得落花流水的残部狼狈地从生死一线的战场撤回后，李独自一人骑着马去慰问他们。他用略带黯淡的口吻自责道：“这都是我的错。是我输了这一战。”




七月四日晚，李开始撤退。当晚大雨滂沱，当他到达波托马克河时，河水已暴涨。李过不了河。

李陷入了困境：前有汹涌的河水，后有得胜的追兵。看起来，李的命运已掌握在北方军将领米德手中。林肯非常高兴，他认为联邦军完全可以从李的左右两翼和后方发动袭击，击溃李的大军，从而以迅雷不及掩耳之势取得战争的胜利。如果当时格兰特在那里，事情大概会按照林肯的预想发生。

但是米德不是斗牛犬似的格兰特，他是徒有其表的学究派。李被困的那一周，林肯每天都不断地催促、命令米德发动攻击。但米德太谨慎，也太胆怯。他根本不想打仗，于是总是犹豫，还发电报找借口，甚至抗命召开军事会议——最后当河水退去李率部逃走时，他什么都没做。

林肯愤怒了。

“这是什么意思？”林肯大叫道，“上帝啊，这是什么意思？敌人就在我们的掌控之下，只要伸一伸手就能拿下他们，但是不管我说什么、做什么，军队就是不作为。在那种情况下，随便哪个将军都能击败李。如果我在那里，我也能打得李满地找牙。”

在极度的失望下，林肯坐下给米德写了封信。林肯这样写道：

亲爱的将军，我认为你并不理解让李逃脱这件事是一场多么巨大的灾难。他就在我们的掌控之下，只要你往前走几步，战争就可以结束了。但是现在，战争将会无限期地拖延下去。

上周一你没有把握击败李，那么之后等你带着只有现在三分之二的兵力到达河南岸时，你又凭什么有把握呢？指望你还能有所作为是一件不理智的事。我现在根本不指望你还能有什么作为。你错失了最佳的机会，对此我感到万分苦恼。

林肯重读了一遍这封信，眼神空洞地望着窗外，陷入了沉思。“如果我在米德的位置，”他也许这样对自己说，“性格和米德一样谨慎，耳朵里塞满了怯懦的军官们提出的建议；如果我和他一样常常半夜惊醒，和他一样见过鲜血淋漓的场面，我也许也会放走李。”

林肯没有寄出这封信，米德也没有读过这封信。直到林肯死后，人们才看到这封和其他文件放在一起的信。




葛底斯堡战役是在七月的第一周打响的。六千人丧生，两万七千名伤者被留在了战场上。教堂、学校和谷仓都变成了临时医院。空气中满是痛苦的哀号。每个小时都有伤员濒临死亡。将士的尸体在酷热的天气下快速地腐烂。埋葬工作必须加快。没有时间挖坑，于是很多时候，只能就地在尸体上覆一层薄土。下了一个星期大雨后，很多尸体都露了出来。于是人们将这些为联邦牺牲的士兵放在了一起，然后统一埋了起来。第二年秋天，墓地委员会决定为这片墓地举办命名仪式，并邀请美国最著名的演说家爱德华·埃弗里特（Edward Everett）致辞。

同时，委员会还向总统、内阁、米德将军、国会两院所有成员、诸多杰出市民和外交使节团的成员发出了正式邀请。接受邀请的人很少，很多人甚至不承认收到了邀请。

委员会根本没预料到总统会来。事实上，他们甚至没有给总统发一封私人请柬，只给林肯发了一张和别人一样的印刷请柬。他们觉得总统的秘书大概会将请柬直接扔进垃圾桶，根本不会拿到总统面前。

因此当总统回信说自己会参加时，委员会震惊了，同时也很为难。他们该怎么办呢？

邀请总统讲话？有人认为总统太忙了，没有时间准备讲话。其他人直白地表示：“即便他有时间准备，他有这个能力吗？”对此，委员会表示十分怀疑。

是，他在伊利诺伊州成功地做了竞选演说，但是为墓地致辞……不，这完全是两码事。这不是林肯的风格。但是他既然来了，总得让他做点什么。所以他们最终在给林肯的回信上表示希望林肯能够在埃弗里特先生演讲结束后“适当地讲两句”。他们原话就是这样说的——“适当地讲两句。”

这样的邀请几乎是一种侮辱，但林肯仍接受了。为什么？这背后还有一个有趣的故事。去年秋天，林肯访问了安提塔姆河战场。一天下午，林肯和伊利诺伊州的旧友沃德·拉蒙（Ward Lamon）一同驾车出行。林肯面朝拉蒙，请他唱那首林肯称之为“悲伤小调”的歌曲。这是林肯最爱的曲子。

“很多次，在伊利诺伊州巡回办案的时候，或者是单独和林肯在白宫的时候，”拉蒙说，“当我唱起这支平凡的曲子时，林肯总是泪流满面。”

这首歌是这样的：

我向着村庄走去，汤姆

我坐在学校操场上

那棵曾经为我们挡风遮雨的树下

可是汤姆，没有人来迎接我

也没有人知道，二十年前

当我们还年幼时

是谁陪在我们左右

泉水旁的榆树上，我刻下你的名字

还在你的名字下方刻上了你心中的挚爱

汤姆，你也在树上刻上了我的名字

一些无情的可怜人剥下了树皮

榆树正在缓缓地死去

就像二十年前刻在上面的名字一样



我的眼睑已干涸许久，汤姆

可现在泪水又涌上了眼眶

我想起了曾经挚爱的她，还有那早已断绝的情愫

我去了教堂的墓地，将花瓣撒在坟上

二十年前，我曾深爱过她

也许，拉蒙唱这首歌的时候，林肯回想起了自己唯一爱过的女人——安·拉特利奇，想起了她正长眠在伊利诺伊平原上冷清的荒冢中。往昔那心酸的回忆让他的眼中蓄满了泪水。为了打破林肯悲伤的魔咒，拉蒙又唱起了一首幽默的黑人歌曲。

事情就是这样。这本是一件无伤大雅又充满哀伤的小事，但林肯的政敌却恶意曲解了这件事，并试图让它成为一件全国性的丑闻。他们将这件事描绘成了一副有伤风化的样子。关于这件丑闻的各种不同的说法，纽约《世界报》连续刊登了三个月。他们谴责林肯在“人人都在忙着掩埋将士尸体”的战场上说说笑笑，唱滑稽的歌曲。

事实是，林肯根本没有说说笑笑，也没有唱歌。当这件事发生的时候，林肯离战场足有数英里远。在这件事发生之前，亡者早就埋葬妥当，是大雨冲开了他们的坟墓。这才是事实。但林肯的政敌并不需要事实。他们渴望看见鲜血，希望全国上下一起强烈谴责林肯。

林肯非常受伤。他很伤心，甚至不愿看那些攻击他的报道，但同时他也不认为自己应该做出回应，因为那样只会让对方的气焰更加嚣张。他只能默默地忍受着一切。因此当他收到为葛底斯堡墓地致辞的邀请时，他欣然接受了。他正需要这样的机会让政敌闭嘴，同时也向那些光荣牺牲的将士表达自己卑微的哀思。

邀请函来得有些晚，林肯只有两周时间来准备他的发言。他利用一切空闲的时间思考发言稿——穿衣服的时候，刮胡子的时候，吃午饭的时候以及在来往斯坦顿的办公室和白宫的路上。甚至躺在战争办公室的皮沙发上等待最新的电报时，他也在思考发言的内容。他将初稿写在一张淡蓝色的大号书写纸上，塞在帽子里随身携带。在发言前的那个礼拜天，林肯说：“我已经修改了两三遍，但还没有定稿。我得再润色一遍才能安心。”

他在致辞前一天抵达了葛底斯堡。整个小镇早已人满为患，原本只有一千三百常住人口的小镇挤入了近三万人。当晚天气很好，夜空明朗，一轮圆月高高地挂在空中。只有一小部分人找到了住处，剩余的人只能彻夜在镇里走来走去。人行道很快便挤得水泄不通，无法通行。于是数百人手挽着手，一边在泥泞的街道中央游行，一边大声唱着“约翰·布朗，你的身躯在坟墓中腐朽”。

那天晚上，林肯一直在“润色”他的发言稿。十一点钟的时候，林肯去了旁边苏华德的房间，将发言稿大声地朗读给他听，并征求他的意见。第二天早上吃过早饭后，林肯继续斟酌他的发言稿。直到门外响起一阵敲门声，他才想起是时候和大部队一起去公墓了。

队伍出发的时候，一开始林肯笔直地坐在马鞍上，但没过多久，他的背便开始向前弯曲，他的头垂在胸口，而那双颀长的双臂则软绵绵地垂在身体两侧……林肯陷入了沉思，一遍又一遍地在脑海中回顾他的发言稿，并将稿件又“润色”了一遍。

爱德华·埃弗里特是墓地委员会指定的演说家，但他在葛底斯堡犯了两个错误。这两个错误既无必要，影响也很坏。首先，他迟到了一个小时；其次，他说了两个小时。

林肯静静地听着埃弗里特的演讲。当他意识到埃弗里特正在收尾时，他知道该轮到自己了，但他十分诚实地认为自己并未做好充分的准备。林肯十分紧张，坐在椅子里不安地扭来扭去。他从双排扣长礼服的口袋中拿出了发言稿，戴上他那副老式的眼镜，迅速地重温着发言的内容。

接着，他拿着发言稿，向前走去。他花了两分钟完成了他的讲话。

听众知道在那个柔和的十一月的下午，他们听到了一场有史以来最伟大的演说吗？他们不知道。大多数听众只觉得好奇，他们从没见过美国总统，也没亲身听过总统讲话。他们伸长脖子打量林肯，却惊讶地发现眼前的这位大高个儿竟然有着一副高亮尖细的嗓音，而且还带着南方口音。他们忘记了林肯本就是肯塔基州人，肯塔基的方言本就带着一股南方口音。当他们以为林肯说完了介绍词，即将开始正式演讲的时候，林肯却坐了下来。

怎么回事？总统是不是忘词了？这就是他的讲话？人们沉浸在震惊和失望之中，甚至忘记了鼓掌。

在印第安纳州的时候，每逢春天，林肯总是用一把生锈的犁耕地，结果泥全沾在了犁板上，弄得一塌糊涂。人们常用“擦不亮”这个词来形容糟糕的情况。在林肯的一生中，每当他想暗示一件事情失败了，他便会借用这句农田上流传的土话。关于那场演说，林肯这样对沃德·拉蒙说：

“拉蒙，那场讲话彻底失败了。擦不亮了。人们都很失望。”

林肯说得没错，每个人都感到失望，包括爱德华·埃弗里特以及和总统一起坐在台上的国务卿苏华德。他们都认为林肯完全搞砸了，并为林肯感到可惜。

林肯很痛苦。忧虑使他的头剧烈地疼痛着，因此在回华盛顿的路上，他只能躺在火车的休息室中，不断用冷水浇头。

林肯至死都以为自己在葛底斯堡的讲话是一场惨败。而就这场演说在当时引起的反响来看，林肯确实是失败了。

林肯本性谦虚，他相信世人“不会留意，也不会长久记得”自己在葛底斯堡说过的话，但是却不会忘记在那里与世长辞的英雄们所做的丰功伟绩。如果林肯可以复活，看到自己那篇葛底斯堡宣言不但没有“擦不亮”，而且还铭刻在了千千万万人的心头，不知道会有多惊讶呢。若他发现自己在葛底斯堡说的那短短十句话被后人当作文学瑰宝，甚至在南北战争已被淡忘的今天，仍被认为是人类珍贵的遗产，他又该多么震惊呢。

林肯的这次葛底斯堡讲话不仅仅是一次讲话。它是一个从痛苦中升华出伟大的灵魂最神圣的告白。它是一首散文诗，是一首史诗般庄严而又影响深远的杰作：

八十七年前，

我们的先辈们在这个大陆上创立了一个新国家，

它孕育于自由之中，

奉行一切人生来平等的原则。



现在我们正从事一场伟大的内战，

以考验这个国家，

或者任何一个孕育于自由和奉行上述原则的国家

是否能够长久存在下去。

我们在这场战争中的一个伟大战场上集会。

烈士们为使这个国家能够生存下去而献出了自己的生命，

我们来到这里，是要把这个战场的一部分奉献给他们作为最后安息之所。

我们这样做是完全应该而且是非常恰当的。



但是，从更广泛的意义上来说，

这块土地我们不能够奉献，不能够圣化，不能够神化。

那些曾在这里战斗过的勇士，活着的和去世的，

已经把这块土地圣化了，

这远不是我们微薄的力量所能增减的。

我们今天在这里所说的话，

全世界不大会注意，也不会长久地记住，

但勇士们在这里所做过的事，全世界却永远不会忘记。

毋宁说，倒是我们这些还活着的人，

应该在这里把自己奉献于

勇士们已经如此崇高地向前推进但尚未完成的事业。

倒是我们应该在这里把自己奉献于仍然留在我们面前的伟大任务，

我们要从这些光荣的死者身上汲取更多的献身精神，

来完成他们已经完全彻底地为之献身的事业；

我们要在这里下定最大的决心，

不让这些死者白白牺牲；

我们要使国家在上帝福佑下得到自由的新生，

要使这个民有、民治、民享的政府永世长存。





24


一八六一年战争的枪声刚打响的时候，在伊利诺伊州的格丽纳小镇上的一家皮革店中，一位衣衫褴褛、面容沮丧的青年正抽着土烟坐在一只包装箱上。他的工作，就目前看来，便是记账和从农民手里收购猪皮和兽皮。

他的两个弟弟是这家店的店主，可是弟弟们不惜一切代价地想把他赶走。几个月前，他一直在圣路易斯大街上游荡，想找份工作，但都没有成功。他的妻子和四个孩子穷困潦倒，于是绝望之下，他借了几美金买了一张火车票，去肯塔基州看望自己的父亲，恳求父亲援助。他的父亲有相当多的现金，但却是只一毛不拔的铁公鸡。于是他的父亲坐下来给格丽纳的两个小儿子写信，要求他们给他们的大哥提供一份工作。

弟弟们立刻将他的名字放在了工资单上。他们这么做，更多是因为父亲的命令，或者说是出于一种施舍，而不是因为兄弟之情。

两美金一天——这是他的工资——或许比他的自身价值高出不少，因为他的经商才能比一只长耳大野兔好不了多少。他十分懒散，喜欢玉米威士忌，而且还不断地欠债。他总是借些小钱，因此他的朋友们在街上遇到他时，都会扭头看向旁边，然后走到街对面去，以防和他碰面。

到目前为止，他生活中的每一件事，都是以失败和挫折结尾的。

到目前为止是这样。

但也只是到目前为止。

因为飞黄腾达的机会就在拐角处等着他。

过不了多久，他就会像一颗燃烧着熊熊火光的流星一样照亮名利的苍穹。

虽然他现在无法命令家乡的父老乡亲尊重自己，但是三年后，世界上最强大的军队将会按照他的命令行事。

四年后，他将战胜李，结束南北战争，并用极其辉煌的方式将自己的名字载入史册。

八年后，他将入主白宫。

再后来，他以胜利者的姿态环游全球，受到了所到之处权贵政要的热烈追捧。他们为他献上奖章和鲜花，还为他举行餐后演讲。谁能想到，当年那个在格丽纳街头人们避而不见的年轻人，能有如此辉煌的一天？

这是一个传奇故事。

而这个故事中的一切都是那么令人匪夷所思。即便是他母亲，对他的态度也十分不同寻常。她似乎从来都不在乎他。他做了总统后，她也不愿去看他。他出生的时候，她甚至懒得为他取名。而她的亲戚给他取名的方式就像抽奖一样随意。他六周大的时候，亲戚们将一个纸袋撕成纸条，在纸条上写上自己最喜欢的名字，然后将所有纸条放在一只帽子里，抽到哪张就用哪张上面的名字。他的外婆辛普森（Simpson）当时正在读荷马的书，于是在纸条上写下了“海勒姆·尤利西斯”。机缘巧合之下，这张纸条被抽中了，于是他往后十七年在家的名字便叫作“海勒姆·尤利西斯·格兰特”。

他是一个羞怯又有些迟钝的孩子，于是镇上的聪明人都叫他“废物西斯·格兰特”。

在西点军校的时候他还有一个名字。那个填写格兰特入学信息的政治家以为他的中间名是他母亲的娘家姓氏辛普森，于是便将他的名字缩写成了“U．S.格兰特”。学员们知道这件事后，大笑着将帽子抛向空中，大声喊道：“孩子们，山姆大叔(5)和我们在一起哦！”因此在往后的时光中，他的这些同学都称他为山姆·格兰特。

他一点儿也不介意。他朋友很少，所以并不在意人们怎么称呼他，也不在意自己的外表和穿着。他的扣子总是不扣好，枪也不擦干净，靴子也不擦得锃亮，列队点名的时候总是迟到。而且，他在西点军校时根本不学拿破仑和腓特烈大帝使用过的军事战略，而是将大量的时间花在读小说上，例如《劫后英雄传》和《最后的莫西干人》。

事实上，他从来没有读过一本关于军事战略的书。

他赢得了战争后，波士顿的人们筹钱为他修建了一座图书馆，并委派了一个委员会去看看他有哪些藏书。令人惊讶的是，委员会发现格兰特竟连一本军事专著也没有。

他不喜欢西点军校，不喜欢军队以及一切和军队有关的人和事。在功成名就之后，有一次他在检阅德国军队时对俾斯麦说：

“我对军事并不感兴趣。事实上，我更像农民而不是军人。我虽然参加了两场战争，但每次参战的时候心里都很后悔，而每次离开战场时心里都带着快意。”

格兰特承认自己最大的毛病就是懒散，一点儿也不愿学习。即便从西点军校毕业后，他仍写出没有词首字母K的knocked（被敲击）和缺少e的safety（安全）。但他对数字很敏感，也一直想做一名数学教授，但当时没有合适的职位，于是他退而求其次地在军营中度过了十一年，因为他总要养活自己，而参军似乎是最简单的方式。

一八五三年他驻扎在加利福尼亚州的洪堡。洪堡旁边有一个小村庄，村里有一个奇怪的家伙，名叫瑞恩。瑞恩经营着一间店铺和一家锯木厂，平时也常做些勘测工作，周日的时候还要布道。在那个年代，威士忌是很便宜的，瑞恩牧师总是在他店铺后面放上一桶开着盖子的威士忌，并在酒桶上挂一只锡酒杯。不管是谁，若是犯了酒瘾，就可以去喝一杯。格兰特经常去那儿喝酒。他很孤独，同时也希望借着酒劲儿忘却他鄙视的军旅生活，于是他常常喝得酩酊大醉，最后被军队开除了。

他身上一美金都没有，也没有工作，于是只能去密苏里州东部投奔岳父，并在接下来的四年中一直在岳父那片八十英亩的农场上种地养猪。冬天的时候，他将砍好的薪柴拉去圣路易斯，卖给那里的城里人。即便这样，他的生活也是一年不如一年，只能靠借债度日。

最后，他离开了农场，搬到了圣路易斯，并在那里找了份工作。他试着卖房子，结果却失败得一塌糊涂。然后他在镇里游荡了数周，试图找一份工作——任何工作都行。最后他实在穷困至极，只能将妻子的黑奴租出去换钱，偿付杂货店的账单。

关于南北战争，有一件事是很不可思议的：李一直都认为奴隶制是不对的，并在离开战时间还很远的时候便释放了自己的黑奴。而格兰特的妻子是拥有黑奴的。当她的丈夫率领着北方军摧毁奴隶制的时候，她自己却一直都有黑奴。

南北战争开始的时候，格兰特厌倦了在格丽纳的皮货店里打工的生活，想重新回到军队。

对于一名西点军校毕业生来说，这应该是很简单的一件事，尤其是在军队招募了成百上千名等着接受严格训练的新兵时。但事实并非如此。格丽纳组织了一支志愿军，并让格兰特训练他们，因为格兰特是唯一一个懂得什么是训练的人。可是当这支队伍在枪筒里插上鲜花奔赴战场时，格兰特只能站在路边看着他们走过。队长的位子给了其他人。

格兰特写信给战争部，介绍了自己的经历，并要求担任团级上校。然而这封信却如石沉大海般杳无回音。后来格兰特做了总统，人们才在战争部的文件堆里看到这封信。

最后他在春田市的副官办公室找到了一份差事，做着十五岁的小姑娘也会做的杂事。他工作的时候也戴着帽子，一支接着一支地抽烟，时不时地站在倚在墙角只有三条腿的破桌子前抄写军令。

就在这个时候，发生了一件完全出人意料的事。正是这件事，使格兰特走上了成名之路。伊利诺伊州第二十一团志愿兵发生了暴乱，堕落成了一群拿着枪的流氓。他们无视军令，咒骂上司，将古德老上校赶出军营，并发誓若他胆敢再次出现，就将他的皮剥下来挂在青苹果树上。

州长叶茨为此十分焦虑。

他其实并不是十分看好格兰特，但毕竟格兰特是西点军校毕业的，于是州长便冒险一试。于是，一八六一年六月一个晴朗的上午，格兰特走出了办公室，来到春田市的露天广场，接手了这支无人管得住的军队。

他手里拿着手杖，腰间系着一条红色的头巾——他身上只有这两样东西能表明他的身份。

他没有骑马，没穿制服，也没有能够买马买制服的钱。他那顶满是汗渍的帽子上破了几个洞，外套的手肘处也磨出了洞。

一看到他的模样，士兵们便嘲笑起他来。一个小伙子对着他的后背挥舞着拳头，另一个士兵则跑到这个拳击手身后，用力推了那人一把。拳击手的身体踉跄地向前倒去，撞到了格兰特的肩膀。

格兰特很快便制止了士兵们的愚蠢行为。若有人违抗军令，便会被绑在柱子上一整天。若有人满嘴污秽，便会立刻被堵住嘴。若士兵们列队时迟到——有一次所有人都迟到了——那就二十四小时不给饭吃。就这样，这位来自格丽纳一家皮货店的店员驯服了那些充满暴力的手下，并带领他们在密苏里州冲锋陷阵。

不久之后，又发生了一件助他平步青云的大好事。在那个时候，战争部正准备提拔一批准将。伊利诺伊州西北军区将伊莱休·本杰明·沃什伯恩（Elihu B．Washburne）派去了国会。沃什伯恩是一个充满了政治野心的人，他迫切地想让家乡的人民知道自己身居要职，于是去了战争部，要求他的州必须出一名准将。战争部同意了他的要求，但是提拔谁呢？很简单，沃什伯恩手里只有一位西点军校毕业生。

于是几天后，格兰特无意中看了一份圣路易斯的报纸，这才知道自己竟然晋升成了准将。

他被派往伊利诺伊州的凯罗总部，一上任便施展开了拳脚。他让士兵们坐上轮船，经过俄亥俄州，占领了肯塔基州的战略要地帕迪尤卡，接着便打算深入田纳西州攻打控制着坎伯兰河的多纳尔森堡。对此，像哈勒克一样的军事专家是这样说的：“一派胡言！格兰特，你这是痴人说梦。这根本是做不到的。你的尝试就等于是自杀。”

格兰特一意孤行地展开了进攻，而且只用了短短一个下午便拿下了多纳尔森堡，还擒获了一万五千名俘虏。

格兰特展开进攻的时候，南方军的将军给他传了信息，恳求休战，以便拟定投降协议。但是格兰特的答复十分强硬：

“我唯一的条件是你们立刻无条件投降。我打算立刻向你们的防御工事进军。”

收到格兰特回复的南方军将领是西蒙·巴克纳（Simon Buckner），他在西点军校的时候就认识了“山姆·格兰特”，并在格兰特被军队开除时借钱给格兰特支付伙食账单。巴克纳认为，看在那笔借款的份上，格兰特言辞也应该温和些。不过巴克纳还是原谅了格兰特，投降后花了一个下午与格兰特一起一边抽着烟一边追忆往昔的时光。

多纳尔森堡之役的胜利具有深远的意义，它为北方保住了肯塔基州，从而联邦军可以不受任何阻碍地向前推进两百英里，将驻扎在田纳西州的大部分南方军赶出去，切断南方军的供给线，从而拿下田纳西首府纳什维尔和有着“密西西比河上的直布罗陀”之称的哥伦布堡。南方的上空因此笼罩着挥之不去的绝望，教堂的钟声与战火的轰鸣声从缅因州一直响彻密西西比河流域。

这是一场巨大的胜利，甚至给欧洲人也留下了极为深刻的印象。这次胜利无疑是南北战争的转折点。

从那时起，人们称格兰特为“只接受无条件投降的格兰特”，而他的那句“我打算立刻向你们的防御工事进军”也成了北方军的战斗口号。

终于，举国上下期待了许久的将领出现在了人们面前。国会将他晋升为少将，并任命他为田纳西州西部军区指挥官。格兰特很快便成了全民偶像。有一家报纸说格兰特喜欢在战场上抽烟，于是转眼间格兰特就收到了来自全国各地的一万多盒香烟。

但是格兰特风光了还不到三个星期，便因为某位嫉妒他的上司对他不公平的对待而流下了愤怒又屈辱的泪水。

他在西部的直接上司是哈勒克。哈勒克是一个十足的浑蛋。富特上将称哈勒克为“军中的白痴”。而林肯的海军部长吉迪恩·韦尔斯（Gideon Welles）熟识哈勒克，他这样评价哈勒克：

“哈勒克没有作为，没有预判，没有建议，没有计划，没有决断。他的特长就是什么都不会。他唯一会的就是骂人、抽烟和挠胳膊肘。”

但是哈勒克自我感觉良好。他曾是西点军校的助理教授，也写过关于军事战略、国际法和采矿的书。他做过银矿主管、铁路主席，还曾是一位出色的律师。他精通法语，还翻译过一本写拿破仑的大部头书。在他自己看来，他是杰出的学者亨利·韦杰·哈勒克。

而格兰特又是什么人？一个不知从哪里冒出来的、整日喝得醉醺醺的、毫无荣誉可言的小队长。格兰特在攻打多纳尔森堡之前曾去见过哈勒克，当时哈勒克十分粗鲁，愤怒而又轻蔑地拒绝了格兰特的军事建议。现在格兰特打了大胜仗，整个国家都拜倒在他脚下，而哈勒克却仍旧默默无闻地在圣路易斯挠着胳膊肘。哈勒克因此感到十分屈辱。

更糟的是，哈勒克认为那位曾经的皮货商一直在侮辱自己。他日复一日地给格兰特发电报，但是格兰特厚颜无耻地无视了他的命令。至少，哈勒克是这样认为的。但他却想错了。格兰特给他发了一封又一封的报告，但是多纳尔森堡之役过后，电报通讯中断了，格兰特的电报一封也没发出去。然而哈勒克并不知道这件事，于是他非常恼火。胜利和公众的赞誉都落到了格兰特的头上，不能就这么完了，他一定会给这个自命不凡的年轻人好好上一课。于是他不停地给麦克莱伦发电报诋毁格兰特。他说格兰特这样，格兰特那样，但总离不开这几个词——傲慢，醉鬼，懒散，无视命令，能力不足。“我被这个目中无人又能力不足的蠢货搞得筋疲力尽。”哈勒克这样说道。

麦克莱伦也十分嫉妒格兰特，于是他给哈勒克回了一封信。从历史的角度看，这是南北战争中最为惊人的一封信：“如果整体利益需要，可以毫不犹豫地逮捕他，让C．F.史密斯接替他的位置。”

哈勒克立刻拘禁了格兰特，并夺走了格兰特手里的军权。做完了这些后，哈勒克便靠在椅子里，心满意足地继续挠着胳膊肘。




战争已经打了一年了，而唯一一位为北方赢得了辉煌胜利的将军却被当众侮辱，并被剥夺了军权。

后来格兰特重新获得了指挥权。接着他在夏伊洛战场不幸地犯下了大错。当时，如果南方军的将领约翰斯顿没有在战斗中流血至死，格兰特就会被包围，全军都会成为俘虏。夏伊洛之战是当时这片大陆上最为激烈的一场战役，格兰特也损失惨重，足足牺牲了一万三千人。他指挥十分愚蠢，从而受到了出其不意的攻击。他理应受到指责。一时间，指责与谩骂呼啸着向他涌来。有人误会他在夏伊洛战场上还喝着酒，数百万民众对此信以为真。公众的愤怒如潮水般席卷全国，人们叫嚷着要罢免他。但是林肯却说：

“我不能放弃这个人。他能打。”

当人们告诉林肯，格兰特酷爱威士忌时，林肯问道：“什么牌子的？我想给其他将军也寄几桶过去。”

一八六三年一月，格兰特下令远征维克斯堡。维克斯堡位于密西西比河上方两百英尺高的悬崖上，是一个天然要塞，因此这场战役耗时长久，而且十分惊心动魄。维克斯堡的防御工事十分强大，而河上的炮艇也无法将加农炮抬高至能打到要塞的高度。格兰特要解决的问题便是拉近与敌军的距离，找到最佳进攻点。

他折回到密西西比的中心地带，试图从东面挺进，但是失败了。

接着他切断了河上的防洪堤，让军队坐船穿过沼泽，从北面挺进，也失败了。

然后他挖开了河道，试图改变密西西比河的流向，又失败了。

这是一个恼人的冬天。雨不停地下着，河水很快便漫进了山谷，格兰特的部队不得不在数英里的沼泽、软泥和丛林里挣扎。士兵们在齐腰的淤泥里吃饭睡觉。疟疾、麻疹和天花爆发了，战场上根本没有卫生设施，于是死亡率高得吓人。

维克斯堡行动是失败的——这是所有人的心声——而且是一次愚蠢的、悲剧的、罪恶的行动。

连格兰特自己的将领——谢尔曼、麦克弗森、洛根、威尔逊——都认为格兰特的计划无比荒谬，全体将士会因此死无葬身之地。全国的媒体都是一片谩骂之词，并要求罢免格兰特。

“除了我，他几乎就没朋友了。”林肯说。

林肯不顾各方的反对，坚决地支持格兰特。他的这份信念获得了丰厚的回报。七月四日——也是怯懦的米德在葛底斯堡放走李的那一天——格兰特骑着马从杰佛逊·戴维斯的种植园闯进了维克斯堡，赢得了一场巨大的胜利。这场胜利比自华盛顿时代以来，美国将领所取得的任何胜利都伟大。

经历了八个月凄凉的失败后，格兰特在维克斯堡擒获了四万俘虏，将整个密西西比河流域都纳入了北方军的掌控之中，从而成功地分裂了南方联盟。

这个激动人心的消息让全国上下都燃烧了起来。

国会特意通过了一项法令，晋升格兰特为中将——华盛顿去世后，还没有人获得过这个殊荣——接着林肯将他请到了白宫，发表了一段简短的致辞，并任命他为联邦军总司令。

格兰特事先得到通知，知道自己在任命后要说几句答谢词。他从口袋里拿出一张皱巴巴的纸条，上面只写了三句话。可当他开始读稿时，只见他手中的稿纸不停地颤抖，他的脸憋得通红，双膝打战，声音卡在了喉咙口。他完全崩溃了，只能双手紧紧抓着稿纸，换了一个位置，深吸了一口气，然后重新开始。

在这位来自格丽纳的皮货商看来，在枪林弹雨中冲锋陷阵也比在十一个人面前说一段八十四个字的演讲来得轻松。

林肯夫人非常希望能为来到华盛顿的格兰特办一场社交盛会，于是早早地为格兰特预订了一顿晚宴和一场派对。可是格兰特却推辞说自己必须尽快赶往前线。

“你可不能不来，”总统说，“林肯夫人的晚宴少了你就像《哈姆雷特》里没有哈姆雷特一样。”

“对于我来说，”格兰特回答道，“一顿晚宴意味着国家一天损失了一百万美元。而且，我也受够这些应酬了。”

林肯很欣赏格兰特的说话方式，因为他和自己一样，讨厌“喧闹和排场”，并且能够“承担责任并作出行动”。

林肯的心中又燃起了希望。他知道，只要有格兰特在，一切都会好起来的。

但是他错了。四个月后，整个国家再次陷入了绝境，比之前更黯淡的绝境。林肯又开始彻夜在房中踱步。他形容憔悴，身心俱疲，十分绝望。





25


一八六四年五月，春风得意的格兰特率领着十二万两千人横渡拉皮丹河。格兰特想借此一举打败李，然后结束战争。

两军在北弗吉尼亚的“蛮荒之地”交战。这个地方正如它的名字一样，到处都是连绵的山丘和沼泽地。整个地区都覆盖着一层浓密的松树和橡树次生林，地面上还长满了下层灌木。这些灌木相互缠绕，就连白尾灰兔也钻不出去。就是在这些昏暗又错综复杂的林子里，格兰特打了一场惨烈又血腥的仗，伤亡人数骇人听闻。林子里燃起了大火，成百上千名负伤的士兵只能眼睁睁地被大火吞噬。

到了第二天晚上，即便是镇定的格兰特也大受震动。他回到自己的营帐哭了起来。

但是每场战斗过后，不管结果如何，格兰特都会下达相同的命令：“进攻！进攻！”

经过六天鲜血淋漓的战斗，格兰特发送了那封著名的电报：“我准备在这儿一直耗下去，即便要打一个夏天也在所不惜。”

结果，这场仗确实打了一个夏天，而且还持续了一个秋天和一个冬天，一直到来年开春才结束。

格兰特的兵力是敌军的两倍，而且他身后是北方源源不断的供给，而南方军的兵源和物资却即将枯竭。

“看来，”格兰特说，“叛军只能强抢襁褓里的婴儿和即将迈入坟墓的老人了。”

格兰特认为，结束战争唯一的也是最快速的方法，就是不断地屠杀李的士兵，直到李投降为止。

每打死一名南方士兵就要损失两名北方士兵？没关系，格兰特能得到源源不断的兵源补充，但李却不行。于是格兰特不停地进攻、冲锋、屠杀。

六个星期之内，他损失了五万四千九百二十六名将士——而李总共也只有这么多人。

在冷港，他一个小时就损失了七千人——比葛底斯堡战役三天双方伤亡总人数还要多一千人。

如此可怕的伤亡又带来了什么呢？

我们应该让格兰特自己来回答这个问题：“什么也没有。”这是他自己说的。

冷港之战是他职业生涯中犯的最悲剧性的错误。

如此惨绝人寰的屠戮超越了人类心理和生理可以承受的范围，军队的士气瓦解，士兵们处于兵变的边缘，军官们也准备叛逃。

“开战三十六天以来，”格兰特手下的一名指挥官说，“从我面前走过的出殡队伍就没有间断过。”

林肯也伤心欲绝，但他知道除了继续坚持别无他法。他给格兰特发电报，要求格兰特“像用钢丝绳夹套牢斗牛犬一样套牢敌人，然后撕碎他们的喉咙。”然后他又发布了征兵令——再招五十万新兵，服役一到三年。

这道征兵令震惊了全国，整个国家陷入了绝望的深渊。

“如今的一切都是一片黑暗，人们十分气馁，心中充满了怀疑。”林肯的一位秘书在日记中这样写道。

七月二日，国会采纳了一项决议，其内容和措辞就像《旧约全书》中先知写的悲歌。它要求国民“坦白忏悔自己身上各种各样的罪孽，恳求全能的主的怜悯与原谅，恳求他作为这个世界的最高统治者不要摧毁我们的民族”。

现在，不管是南方还是北方，都口径一致地咒骂着林肯。他们骂林肯是篡位者、叛徒、暴君、恶魔，还骂他是“一个残忍地将将士送到敌人刀口下的屠夫，一个哭嚷着要更多人去送死的刽子手”。

林肯的一些死敌宣称应该将林肯处死。某天晚上，当林肯骑着马从军人之家夏令总部出来时，一名刺客向他开枪。子弹穿过了他头顶的丝绸礼帽。

几个星期后，宾夕法尼亚州米德维尔的一位旅馆老板发现一间房间的窗玻璃上刻着这样一句话：“一八六四年八月十三日，亚伯拉罕·林肯中毒身亡。”这间房间前一晚登记在了一位名叫布斯的著名演员名下——约翰·威尔克斯·布斯（John Wilkes Booth）。

之前六月份的时候，共和党提名林肯连任总统，现在他们却万般悔恨，觉得那完全是一个错误。共和党内一些重量级的人物都奉劝林肯主动放弃提名。其他人的态度则更为强硬，他们想要再召开一次大会，承认林肯的失败，取消他的提名，然后让其他候选人替代林肯的位置。

即便是林肯的密友奥威尔·勃朗宁（Orville Browning）也在一八六四年七月的日记中这样写道：“现在国家迫切需要一位有能力的领导人来主持大局。”

现在，林肯也认为自己毫无希望。他完全放弃了连任的想法。他失败了，他的将领失败了，他的战争政策也失败了。人们对他的领导失去了信心，他害怕联邦会因此毁于一旦。

“即便是天堂，”林肯说，“现在也是黑暗的。”

终于，一群讨厌林肯的激进分子召开了党内会议，提名约翰·弗里蒙特（John C．Frémont）将军为候选人，分裂了共和党。

当时的形势非常糟糕，而且几乎可以肯定的是，若不是弗里蒙特之后退出了选举，那么民主党候选人麦克莱伦将军便会战胜分裂的共和党，整个国家的历史也会因此而完全被改变。

即便弗里蒙特退出了选举，林肯的票数也只比麦克莱伦多了二十万张选票。

尽管受到了刻薄的谴责，林肯仍保持着冷静，只管做好自己的事，不去搭理那些人。

“我希望，”林肯说，“自己可以这样执政：等到了卸下权力的那天，即便失去了所有朋友，但我至少能留住一位朋友，而那位朋友便是我内心深处的良知……我不是一定要赢，但我一定不能虚假。我不是一定要成功，但一定要对得起内心的那份光明。”

他常常疲倦又沮丧地躺在沙发上，拿着《圣经》，从《约伯记》中寻求安慰：“你要如勇士束腰，我问你，你可以指示我。”




一八六四年夏天，林肯的身心都发生了很大的变化。他已不再是三年前那个来自伊利诺伊大草原的高大汉子了。年复一年，他的笑声越来越少，脸上的皱纹加深了，脸颊凹陷，肩背也佝偻起来。他患有慢性消化不良，冬天的时候腿总是发冷。他晚上睡不着觉，脸上总是习惯性地挂着一副痛苦的表情。他对朋友说：“我觉得自己好像再也不会快乐了。”

当奥古斯都·圣·高登斯（Augustus Saint-Gaudens）看到一八六五年春天制作的林肯脸模塑像时，这位著名的雕塑家坚持认为那是林肯的遗容面模，因为塑像的脸上已经显示出了死亡的气息。

卡朋特住在白宫创作历史名画《林肯总统首次宣读解放奴隶宣言》时这样写道：

蛮荒之地战役开始的第一周，总统几乎没有睡过觉。那天，我穿过后宅大厅的时候遇到了总统先生。他正穿着长长的晨袍来回踱步。他双手背在身后，眼睛周围有很重的黑眼圈，头耷拉在胸前——他很悲伤，也很焦虑……在那段日子里，每次看到他那布满皱纹的脸庞，我就忍不住心疼地哭泣。

访客们来的时候，总是能看到他瘫坐在椅子里。他看上去非常疲倦，以至于访客们一开始和他说话，他都没有力气抬头或者答话。

“我有的时候觉得，”他说，“每天接待的每一位访客都仿佛伸着手指向我冲来，然后从我身上挖走一部分生命力。”

他对《汤姆叔叔的小屋》的作者斯托太太说，自己活不到和平的时候了。

“这场战争在一点一点地谋杀我。”他说。

他的朋友们意识到他的外形发生了巨大变化后，都劝他好好给自己放个假。

“休息两三个星期对我来说根本没用。”他回答道，“我根本躲不开自己的思绪。我不知道该怎么休息。疲倦蛰伏在我的体内，我拿它一点儿办法也没有。”

“林肯的耳边，”他的秘书说，“总是回响着寡妇和孤儿的哭声。”

每天都有女人——有的是母亲，有的是妻子，有的是恋人——跑到林肯面前哭泣，恳求他饶恕她们被判枪决的男人。林肯不管多疲惫，多筋疲力尽，都会耐心地倾听她们的故事，而且基本上都会同意她们的请求，因为他见不得女人哭，尤其是怀里抱着婴儿的女人。

“等我走后，”他悲叹道，“我希望人们在评价我时能认为我拔掉了那些我认为能长出花朵的土壤上的荆棘，然后种上了花朵。”

将军们骂声一片，斯坦顿也大发雷霆：林肯的仁慈正在摧毁军队的纪律，他必须不再插手此事。但是事实上，林肯厌恶准将们残酷的作风和正规军专制的制度。相反，他喜欢和他一样来自森林和农场的志愿军，并将胜利的希望放在了他们身上。

有人因为胆怯而被判死刑？林肯会饶恕他。林肯说：“我从来都不能确定，如果自己上了战场，会不会因为害怕也弃枪逃跑。”

有志愿兵想家然后逃跑了？“我看不出枪毙了他有什么好处。”

一个来自佛蒙特州的农场男孩在放哨的时候睡着了？“我自己也有可能会睡着。”林肯也许会这样说。

他开出的赦免名单长达好几页。

他曾给米德将军发电报说，“我不希望看到任何十八岁以下的士兵被执行枪决。”而在联邦军的队伍里，十八岁以下的士兵大约有一百万人。事实上，大约有二十万士兵年龄在十六岁以下，约有十万士兵小于十五岁。

有的时候，总统会在最严肃的命令中加入一些幽默色彩。例如，他曾这样给穆里根上校发电报：“如果你还没来得及枪毙巴尼，那就别下手啦。”

母亲们的丧子之痛深深地触动了林肯。一八六四年十一月二十一日，他写下了一生中最为动人的一封信。牛津大学将这封信的副本贴在了墙上，作为“无法超越的纯美措辞的典范”。

这封信是一篇散文，也是一首能引起共鸣的绝美诗歌：

致华盛顿马萨诸塞州比克斯比夫人

敬爱的夫人：

我在战争办公室的文件堆里看到麻省副官的一份报告，得知您的五个儿子都光荣地牺牲在了战场上。我觉得，我的任何话语都是那么的苍白和无济于事，无法让您从这令人难以承受的悲痛中得到解脱。但我无法抑制自己代表您的儿子们誓死捍卫的共和国向您表示感谢，希望您能因此得到些许安慰。我恳求天父抚慰您的丧子之痛，只为您留下与已逝的儿子们最珍贵的回忆和您当之无愧的为自由的祭坛奉上了巨大牺牲的庄严的自豪感。

您最诚挚且心怀尊敬的

亚伯拉罕·林肯

于华盛顿总统府

一八六四年十一月二十一日

有一天，诺亚·布鲁克斯（Noah Brooks）给了林肯一本奥利弗·温德尔·霍姆斯（Oliver Wendell Holmes）的诗集。林肯翻开书页，大声地朗读起《莱克星顿》这首诗来，可是当他读到诗节的开头几句时，他的声音颤抖了，他哽咽着说不出话，然后将诗集还给了布鲁克斯。他喃喃地说：“你读吧，我读不下去了。”

那几句诗是这样的：

英灵长眠之处绿草如茵，

他们就地安息，

没有寿衣，也没有坟墓

几个月后，林肯在白宫当着朋友们的面完整地背诵了这首诗，一字不差。

一八六四年四月五日，林肯收到了一封来自宾夕法尼亚州华盛顿郡一位伤心欲绝的女孩的来信。

“我在担心与害怕中犹豫了很久，”女孩写道，“最终还是决定将我的烦恼告诉您。”她订婚多年的未婚夫参军了，之后经部队允许回家投票。他们两人，用那女孩的话说“十分愚蠢地沉溺在了夫妻生活中”，现在“如果您不怜悯我们，不允许他回家让我们把之前的事合法化，那么这份沉溺便会为我们带来一个私生子……我恳求上帝，希望您不要让我活在嘲笑和伤心之中”。

读了这封信后，林肯深受触动。他无神地凝视着窗外，眼中蓄满了泪水……

林肯拿起笔，在女孩的信下方给斯坦顿写了这样一句话：“务必让他回到她的身边。”




一八六四年那个可怕的夏天终于过去了。秋天便传来了好消息：谢尔曼拿下了亚特兰大，正在朝佐治亚州进军。海军上将法拉格特经过了一场卓绝的海战后拿下了莫比尔湾，加强了对墨西哥湾的封锁。谢里丹在谢南多厄河谷赢得了辉煌的胜利。现在的李只能缩在老窝里一步也不敢动，于是格兰特开始围攻彼得斯堡和里士满……

南方联盟已是穷途末路。

林肯的将军们打了胜仗，林肯的政策也被证明是对的，北方军气势如虹。因此，十一月的时候，林肯获得了连任，但林肯并未将这看作是个人的胜利，而是简洁地说，人们终于不再认为“过河的时候交换马匹”是一件明智的事了。

经过了四年征战，林肯心中竟未有半点儿对南方人民的憎恨。他总是说：“‘你们不要评判人，免得你们被评判。’若我们处于他们的位置，也会那样做的。”

因此，一八六五年二月，南方联盟濒临瓦解，距李投降还有两个月的时候，林肯向联邦政府提议拿出四亿美元，作为南方诸州释放黑奴的补偿。但是内阁无人同意他的这个提案，于是他只能作罢。

一八六五年三月，在第二次就职典礼上，林肯发表了第二次就职演说。这篇演说被当时的牛津大学校长柯曾伯爵誉为“是人类口中，不，是神明口中说出的最珍贵的金玉良言”。

当时的林肯走上前去，亲吻了一下翻开在《以赛亚书》第五章的《圣经》，如戏剧中的伟人一般开始了他那著名的演讲。

“那是一首神圣的诗，”卡尔·舒茨这样写道，“从没有哪位领袖对民众说过那样的话。美国也没有哪位总统有着如此深情的肺腑之言。”

在舒茨的眼中，林肯演说的结束语是人类能说出的最高尚最美丽的语言，令人想起昏暗的大教堂中奏响的管风琴曲。

我们痴心地希望——我们常常祈祷——这场灾难能够快速地走向终结。但如果上帝一定要让它继续下去，直到二百五十年来因奴隶的无偿辛劳而堆积起来的财富烟消云散，直到像三千年前所说的那样，鞭笞所流的每一滴血都被宝剑刺出的每一滴血抵消，那么我们仍然只能说，“主的裁判是完全正确而且公道的。”

对任何人都不能心怀恶意，对所有人都要心存宽容。上帝让我们看见正义，让我们坚持完成我们正在进行的事业，因此我们更要坚持正义。怀着这样的信念，我们要治愈这个国家的伤口，照顾那些承受战争之苦的战士，以及他们的遗孀和孤儿——我们要做一切能为我们以及所有的民族带来公正而持久的和平的事。

两个月后，在林肯的葬礼上，这篇演讲再次被人宣读。





26


一八六五年三月末，弗吉尼亚州的里士满发生了一件大事。南方联盟主席杰佛逊·戴维斯的妻子处理掉了她的拉车马，将自己的个人财产放在一家绸缎店寄卖，然后将剩余的财物打包，朝更南的地方去了……看来有事情要发生了。

格兰特已包围了南方联盟的首都九个月。李的军队衣衫褴褛，缺乏食物。钱已变成了稀有物品，士兵们几乎拿不到薪水，即便发钱，也是早已一文不值的联盟发行的纸币。物价疯涨，一杯咖啡要三美金，木柴五美金一根，而一桶面粉则要卖到上千美金。

分裂联邦注定要失败，奴隶制也是一样。李很清楚这一点，他手下的士兵也清楚这一点。逃兵数量达到了十万之巨，甚至还出现了整团的士兵集体逃走的事。剩下的士兵转而从宗教中得到安慰和希望。每个营帐里都举行祷告会。人们尖叫着，哭喊着，眼前出现了幻觉。每次奔赴战场前，所有的人都会先跪着祈祷一番。

虽然他们很虔诚，但里士满政权仍旧摇摇欲坠。

四月二日，正好是星期天，李的军队一把火烧了镇上的棉花、烟草仓库和军械厂，摧毁了停在码头的造了一半的船只，在滔天烈焰和黑夜的掩护下逃离了里士满。

然而李的军队一出城，格兰特便带着七万两千大军穷追不舍，并从两翼和后方持续地发动猛烈的攻击。与此同时，谢里丹的骑兵撕毁了铁路，截获了南方军的供给列车，从而在前方拦截住了南方军。

谢里丹向总部发电报：“我认为如果继续这样下去，李一定会投降的。”

林肯回复说：“让战争尽快结束。”

事实确实如此。经过了八十英里的夺命追击，格兰特最终将南方军团团包围了起来。南方军已如困兽，李也意识到，多余的流血已毫无意义。

而此时的格兰特却落在大军后面。他的头痛病犯了，痛得视线模糊，全身麻木，因此不得不在周六晚上停在途中的一个农庄休息。

“我在那儿住了一夜，”他在回忆录中写道，“我将脚泡在加了芥末粉的热水中，然后在手腕和脖子后面抹上芥末膏药，希望第二天早上能恢复健康。”

第二天早晨，他的病完全好了。然而治愈他的不是芥末膏药，而是一位骑马而来的信使送来的李的一封信。李在信上说愿意投降。

“送信的军官来找我的时候，”格兰特写道，“我仍旧头痛欲裂。但是一看到信上的内容，我便立刻好了。”

那天下午，两位将军在一间空荡荡的客厅里商谈投降条款。格兰特和往常一样，穿得十分邋遢，鞋子脏兮兮的，没有佩剑，穿着一件普通二等兵制服——唯一能表明他身份的便是肩头那三颗银星。

具有贵族气派的李将军与格兰特形成了鲜明的对比。李戴着镶了珠串的金属护手，佩剑上也镶了珠宝，活像从钢版画中走出来的高贵的征服者。而格兰特则像是一个从密苏里州来到镇上卖猪肉和兽皮的农民。面对李，格兰特第一次为自己邋遢的外表感到羞愧，并向李道歉自己没有为这个场合准备得体的衣服。

二十年前，美国和墨西哥打仗的时候，李和格兰特一同在美国正规军中服役。现在，他们陷入了对往昔的回忆，谈起了他们那支“正规军”在墨西哥边界度过的那个冬天，谈起了他们曾通宵畅玩的扑克游戏，还谈起了曾演出过的《奥赛罗》，格兰特还反串了美丽的女主角苔丝狄蒙娜。

“我们聊得非常愉快。”格兰特回忆道，“我差点儿忘记了会谈的主要目的。”

终于，李将话题带回了投降条款上，可是格兰特回答得十分简略，接着便又神游到了二十年前的事情上。他想到了基督圣体节，想到了一八四五年冬天，狼群在草原上咆哮，想到了波浪在阳光下熠熠生辉，想到了只要三美金便能买到的野马。

若不是李再一次打断格兰特并提醒他自己是来投降的，格兰特大概能说上一个下午。

于是格兰特要来笔和墨水，潦草地写下了条款。这一次不会像一七八一年华盛顿在约克镇接受英军投降那样，让手无寸铁的敌人在狂喜的胜利者们面前列队游行，并举行侮辱性的投降协议签约仪式。这一次没有任何复仇行为。四年来，北方的激进派一直要求以叛国罪处死李和其他西点军校毕业的背叛联邦的南方军官，但是格兰特的条款却一点儿也不苛刻。李的军官可以保留武器，他的士兵将会获得假释，然后重返家园。每个要求得到一匹马或骡子的士兵都可以爬上它将它骑回自己的农场或棉花田，继续耕种土地。

为什么投降条款如此温和大方？因为这是亚伯拉罕·林肯亲口说的。

于是，这场牺牲了五十万人的浩大战争在弗吉尼亚州一个名叫阿波马托克斯的小村庄结束了。在一个平和的飘着紫丁香芬芳的春日下午，李投降了。那一天正好是圣枝主日(6)。

那天下午，林肯乘坐“河中女王号”轮船赶回华盛顿。他大声地向朋友们朗读莎士比亚的作品，一读便是好几个小时。他读到了《麦克白》中的这一段：

邓肯是在他的坟墓里睡着了，

生命经过了一场场热病，

现在的他睡得很安稳。

叛国已经对他施过最狠毒的伤害，

再没有刀剑、毒药、内乱、外患，

可以加害于他了。

这几句台词在林肯心中留下了深刻的印象。他又读了一遍，然后停了下来，双目出神地凝视着窗外。

然后他又大声地将这一段读了一遍。

五天后，林肯逝世了。





27


我们现在必须回头看看，因为我想要和你们说一件发生在里士满被攻克之前的小事——这件事是一个生动的侧影，从中我们可以看出林肯默默地在二十多年的家庭生活中承受了怎样的痛苦。

事情发生在格兰特司令部附近。格兰特邀请林肯和林肯夫人前往前线附近休假一个星期。

林肯夫妇欣然应邀。自林肯入主白宫以来，还没有休过假，他早已累坏了，也渴望有机会逃离那些自他继任后接踵而来骚扰他的求职者。

因此他和林肯夫人一起登上了“河中女王号”，沿着波托马克河南下，穿过切萨皮克湾的低洼河段，经过老波因特康福特，再沿詹姆斯河至波因特市。在那里，那位来自格丽纳的皮货商正坐在离水面两百英尺高的悬崖上，一边抽烟一边砍木头。

几天后，一群来自华盛顿的上流人士加入了总统的度假行列，其中包括法国部长若弗鲁瓦。自然，访客们很想去十二英里外的波托马克大军的战线看看。于是第二天，一行人便启程了——男人们骑着马，林肯夫人和格兰特夫人则坐在一辆半敞篷的马车里。

亚当·巴多（Adam Badeau）将军是格兰特的军事秘书兼副官，同时也是格兰特将军的密友。那天他奉命陪护夫人们。他背对着马坐在马车前座，与夫人们面对着面，因此见证了那天发生的所有事。现在我将他在《和平时期的格兰特》一书中第三百五十六页至三百六十二页中的内容摘录如下：

在谈话的过程中我无意中提到前线所有军官的女眷都奉命转移到了后方——这意味着即将发起军事行动。我说，所有女眷都撤离了，除了查尔斯·格里芬（Charles Griffn）将军的夫人，因为总统特许她可以留在前线。

这时，林肯夫人变得十分恼火。“先生，你这么说是什么意思？”她大声地问道，“你的意思是不是说她曾和总统单独相处过？你是否知道我绝不允许总统和任何女性单独相处？”

很明显，她对可怜的、其貌不扬的亚伯拉罕·林肯有着强烈的妒忌心。

我试着为自己的话辩解，希望能安抚她的情绪。但是她愤怒得失去了控制。“先生，你的笑容让人猜不透。”她大喊道，“我要下车，亲自问总统是否单独和那个女人相处过。”

格里芬夫人是继艾斯特哈吉女伯爵之后华盛顿最知名也是最优雅的女性，是卡罗尔家族的人，也是格兰特夫人的密友。格兰特夫人努力地安抚激动的林肯夫人，但都无济于事。林肯夫人再次命令我让车夫停车。正当我犹豫时，她突然伸出手越过我，迅速抓住马车前面的车夫。幸好格兰特夫人说服她等大家都下马后再说。

当晚，待我们都回到营地后，格兰特夫人和我谈起了这件事。她说整件事实在是令人厌烦又窘迫，所以我们谁也不能再提。至少，我是肯定要保持沉默的，而她也只会告诉格兰特将军。但是第二天，我便不用再保守秘密了，因为“更糟糕的在后面呢”。

第二天一早，我们一行人便去詹姆士河北岸参观了奥德将军指挥的詹姆士大军。

当天的行程安排和前一天差不多。我们乘坐蒸汽船渡河，然后男人仍旧骑马，林肯夫人和格兰特夫人则乘坐一辆急救马车。我仍旧奉命陪护她们，但这次要求添一个伴。经过昨天的事后，我不愿意成为车厢内唯一一名军官。于是，霍勒斯·波特上校奉命加入了我们。奥德夫人陪着她的丈夫。她是指挥官的太太，不必遵守女眷撤离的命令。但我能确定，那天还没过完，她就一定无比希望自己身处华盛顿或者任何远离军队的地方。马车坐满了，她便骑马前行，并与总统并肩走了一段路，因此便走到林肯夫人前面去了。

林肯夫人一看到这个画面便无法抑制地发起怒来。“那个女人是什么意思？”她大声嚷道，“她骑在总统旁边是什么意思？她走到我前面是什么意思？她是不是想说，总统希望她在身边？”

她陷入了狂怒之中。她的言语和行动每过一秒都变得更加过分。

格兰特太太再次尝试安抚她，可是林肯夫人却又对着格兰特夫人发起火来。而波特和我能做的，就是确保她的愤怒只停留在言语层面。我们怕她会突然跳车，然后朝车队大喊。

林肯夫人气急了，她对格兰特夫人说：“我猜你一定觉得自己有一天可以住进白宫，对吧？”格兰特夫人庄重而冷静地回答她十分满意现在的位置，现在的一切已经超乎她的期待太多了。但是林肯夫人却说：“如果你有那样的机会，还是要争取一把。住进白宫可是很不错呢！”接着她又开始骂奥德夫人，而格兰特夫人则冒着引起更大风波的风险为朋友辩护。

正当这场风波平息之时，苏华德少校——国务卿苏华德的侄子，同时也是奥德将军手下的军官——骑马上前说了句玩笑话：“林肯夫人，总统先生的坐骑可真殷勤，总是在奥德太太旁溜达。”

这无疑是火上浇油。

“先生，你这么说是什么意思？”她大声问道。

苏华德少校这才发现自己犯了一个巨大的错误。这时他的马儿立刻展现出了自己的特技——往后倒退，迫使他远离风暴。

一行人终于到达了目的地。奥德夫人下马来到急救马车面前。接着林肯夫人开始辱骂她，当着众多军官的面骂她无耻，还问她一路跟着总统是什么意思。那位可怜的夫人一下子哭了起来，询问自己犯了什么错。但林肯夫人丝毫不让步，一直骂到她累了为止。格兰特夫人一直试图为自己的朋友辩护。所有人都又惊又恐。最后这场闹剧终于过去了，没过多久我们就到了波因特市。

那天晚上，总统先生和林肯夫人在蒸汽船上设宴答谢格兰特夫妇和将军手下的众多军官。当着我们所有人的面，林肯夫人向总统先生严厉指责奥德将军，还让总统先生将他撤职。她只说奥德将军不适合这个位子，丝毫不提他的夫人。坐在旁边的格兰特将军则公然维护自己的下属。当然，奥德将军并没有被撤职。

在这次参观访问期间，类似的场景出现了很多次。林肯夫人经常因为格里芬夫人和奥德夫人当着众多军官的面斥责她的丈夫。当我看到我们的国家元首，这个在如此艰难的时刻肩负起这个国家一切的男人向这无法言说的当众侮辱屈服的时候，我第一次为不是密友的人感到如此深切的委屈和心痛。他就像耶稣基督一样承受着这一切。他总是十分庄严而镇定，但他脸上那痛苦又悲伤的神情却像刀子般割裂着旁人的心。他老式地称呼她为“孩子他妈”，他的眼神和语气里满是哀求，他努力地向她解释，努力地阻止她对旁人的侵犯，可她却像只母老虎一样将怒气全部撒在他身上。每当这时他便会默默走开，藏起那张其貌不扬的高贵面孔，这样我们便看不到他脸上悲惨的神情。

谢尔曼将军也见证过类似的场景，在他多年前的回忆录里做了记录。

海军的巴恩斯上校既是见证人，也是受害者。奥德夫人那次骑马的时候，巴恩斯上校就陪在奥德夫人身旁。他拒绝指认奥德夫人有错，于是林肯夫人恨透了他。一两天后，巴恩斯上校找总统汇报公务，当时林肯夫人和其他几位军官都在场。总统夫人用所有人都能听到的声音对巴恩斯说了异常无礼的话。林肯沉默着。过了一会儿，他朝那位年轻的军官走去，拉着巴恩斯的手臂将他带到自己的房间，给他看了一张地图或是一份文件。巴恩斯告诉我，总统先生并没有评价刚才发生的事，他不能指责自己的妻子，但他却用在我看来最有教养的方式向自己手下的军官表达了懊悔和尊重。

这些事情发生前没多久，斯坦顿夫人去了波因特市。机缘巧合之下我问了她几个关于总统夫人的问题。

“我不拜访林肯夫人。”这便是她的回答。

我想我一定是听错了。战争部长夫人肯定会拜访总统夫人的。于是我又问了一遍。

“您不明白吗，先生？”她又说了一遍，“我不去白宫，也不拜访林肯夫人。”我和斯坦顿夫人并不熟悉，因此这番言论让我印象深刻。后来我便全都理解了。

林肯夫人继续对努力安抚自己的格兰特夫人恶语相向。后来林肯夫人变得更加粗暴。有一次她因为格兰特夫人在她面前坐着而对其大肆责难。“我没邀请你坐下之前你怎么敢坐下？”林肯夫人说道。

伊丽莎白·凯克利（Elizabeth Keckley）(7)是陪同总统夫人前往格兰特的指挥部的随行人员。她讲述了那次晚宴的情形，就好像“女总统”登上了“河中女王号”一样。

来宾之中有一位卫生委员会的年轻军官。他坐在林肯夫人旁边，为了活跃气氛，他开玩笑地说：“林肯夫人，您真该看看总统胜利进入里士满那天的风采。他是万众瞩目的焦点。女士们向他飞吻致意，挥动着手帕欢迎他的到来。他就像英雄一样，四周围满了年轻姑娘。”

突然，那位年轻的军官尴尬得不出声了。

林肯夫人双眼冒火地看着他。从她的眼神中可以知道，这位军官的亲切惹恼了她。

接下来的场景可想而知。我想这位惹怒了林肯夫人的军官永远也不会忘记那个难忘的夜晚。

“我从来没见过比林肯夫人更古怪的女人，”凯克利夫人说，“找遍全世界也找不出一个和她一样的人。”

“随便问一个你遇到的美国人，‘林肯的夫人是一个什么样的人？’”荷诺·威尔西·莫罗（Honoré Willsie Morrow）在她的《玛丽·托德·林肯》一书中写道，“百分之九十九的人会回答‘她是泼妇，是她丈夫的诅咒，是粗俗的傻瓜，也是疯子’。”

对于林肯来说，人生的悲剧不是遭遇暗杀，而是他的婚姻。

当布斯开枪的时候，林肯并不知道击中自己的是什么。但是二十三年来，他几乎每天都在收获赫恩登说的“不幸婚姻带来的恶果”。

“在暴风雨般的党派仇恨和反叛斗争中，”巴多将军说，“在经受十字架般的痛苦中，林肯却还要忍受不幸的婚姻生活带来的辛酸。而林肯却说：‘主啊，宽恕他们吧，他们不知道自己在做什么。’”




伊利诺伊州的参议员奥维尔·H.布朗宁（Orville H．Browning）是林肯执政期间的密友。两人相识已有二十五年。布朗宁经常去白宫吃晚饭，有时还会在白宫过夜。布朗宁有记日记的习惯，而且记录得十分详细。我们只能猜测他在日记中对林肯夫人进行了怎样的描述，因为凡是看过他日记的作家都必须以名誉担保不会泄露任何诋毁林肯夫人的言论。最近这本日记出版了，条件是出版物中必须删除所有关于林肯夫人可怕的描述。

在白宫的公开接待会上，依照传统，总统要选择一位除妻子以外的女士走在前面。

但是管他什么传统，林肯夫人是不会允许这样的事情发生的。让别的女人走在她前面？让别的女人挽着总统的手臂？想都别想。

她总是独断专行，华盛顿社交圈对此一片斥责声。

她不仅不允许总统和其他女士同行，甚至看到总统与其他女士说话，也会嫉妒得对着总统破口大骂。

在开公开接待会之前，林肯会事先询问自己那充满了嫉妒心的夫人，他可以和哪位女士说话。林肯夫人会提到很多女士，但不是不喜欢这个，就是讨厌那个。

“但是孩子他妈，”林肯抗议道，“我总归要和人说话的。我不可能像个傻子一样站在那里一言不发。你要是说不出我该和谁说话，那就告诉我不能和谁说话吧。”

她坚持按照自己的方式行事，不管付出什么代价。有一次，她威胁林肯如果不晋升某位官员，她就当着众人的面撒泼打滚。

还有一次，林肯在做一个重要访谈，她冲进他的办公室，说了一大通话。林肯没有回答，镇定地站起身，抓住她，将她带离了办公室，安排她坐下，然后回到办公室，锁上门继续做访谈，就好像从未被打扰过一样。

她咨询了一位巫师，巫师说内阁成员都是林肯的敌人。

她对此并不感到惊讶，因为她一点儿都不喜欢他们。

她看不起苏华德，说他是“伪君子”，是“一双被人丢弃的破鞋”，说他不值得信任，还警告林肯不要和他来往。

“她对蔡斯的仇恨，”凯克利夫人说，“更为强烈。”

她憎恨蔡斯的原因之一是，蔡斯有个女儿名叫凯特，是华盛顿社交圈最漂亮迷人的女士，她嫁给了一个有钱人。凯特有时会参加白宫接待会。让林肯夫人感到厌恶的是，只要凯特一出现，所有的男人都围着她团团转。

凯克利夫人说：“林肯夫人嫉妒那些受欢迎的女士，一点儿也不愿意凯特因为自己父亲的政治地位而在社交圈中扶摇直上。”

她总是带着满腔的怒气要求林肯免去蔡斯在内阁中的职位。

她也十分讨厌斯坦顿。每当听到斯坦顿批评自己，她便会“将那些说斯坦顿易怒又不易相处的书籍和简报寄给斯坦顿作为回礼”。

对于林肯夫人的种种咒骂和挖苦，林肯会说：

“孩子他妈，你误会了。你的偏见太主观了，根本没有道理可言。如果我听你的，我很快就没有内阁了。”

她非常讨厌安德鲁·约翰逊（Andrew Johnson），憎恨麦克莱伦。她看不起格兰特，说格兰特是“一个顽固的傻瓜和屠夫”，还说若是自己带领军队，肯定比格兰特强。她还经常发誓若格兰特成为总统，她就离开美国，只要格兰特在白宫一天，她就不会回国。

“孩子他妈，”林肯会这样说，“假设我们让你指挥军队，你肯定会比这些将军做得好。”

李投降后，格兰特夫妇来到了华盛顿。整个城市灯火辉煌，人们唱着歌，点燃篝火，尽情狂欢。林肯夫人给格兰特将军写信，邀请他与总统和自己一同驾车上街，“观赏那一片璀璨的灯火”。

但是她没有邀请格兰特夫人。

几天之后，她安排了一场聚会，邀请格兰特夫妇和斯坦顿夫妇前往剧院的总统包厢看戏。

斯坦顿夫人收到邀请后立刻找到了格兰特夫人，问她要不要去。

“除非你也接受邀请，”斯坦顿夫人说，“否则我是不会去的。我无法在没有你的情况下和林肯夫人共处一室。”

格兰特夫人不敢接受这份邀请。

她知道一旦格兰特将军跨入包厢，观众一定会以最热烈的掌声来欢迎这位“阿波马托克斯英雄”。

到时候林肯夫人会做出什么事呢？谁也说不准。她也许会再制造一个令人难以忘怀的难堪的场面。

格兰特夫人拒绝了林肯夫人的邀请，斯坦顿夫人也一样。正是因为她们的拒绝，她们的丈夫才保住了一命。因为那一晚，布斯爬进了总统包厢枪杀了林肯。如果斯坦顿和格兰特也在场，布斯也许会把他们也杀了。





28


一八六三年，弗吉尼亚州的一群贵族奴隶主出资成立了一个秘密团体，目标是暗杀亚伯拉罕·林肯。一八六四年十二月，亚拉巴马州的塞尔玛市的报纸上出现了一则广告，恳求公众捐款资助针对林肯的暗杀行动。其他的南方日报则刊登了暗杀林肯的现金悬赏。

但是最终杀了林肯的那个人，既不是出于对南方的热爱，也不是出于对金钱的追逐。约翰·威尔克斯·布斯之所以暗杀林肯是为了出名。

布斯是一个什么样的人？他是一个演员，上天赋予了他得天独厚的英俊外表和个人魅力。林肯的秘书曾这样描绘布斯：“像拉塔莫斯山上的恩底弥翁一样俊美，是他所在圈子的宠儿。”弗朗西斯·威尔逊（Francis Wilson）在布斯传记中这样写道：“他是世界上最成功的情人……当他在街上走过的时候，站在街上的女人们便会立刻爱上他。”

二十三岁的时候，布斯已是深受女观众喜爱的男演员。他最知名的角色是罗密欧。不管他在哪里演出，多情的少女们都会拿着充满柔情蜜意的情书向他涌去。他在波士顿演出的时候，喜欢他的女士挤满了蒙特饭店门前的街道，只为在他经过的时候匆忙看他一眼。某天晚上，善妒的女明星汉丽埃塔·欧文（Henrietta Irving）在酒店房间里刺了布斯一刀，然后便打算自杀殉情。布斯刺杀林肯后的那个早晨，他的另一位女友艾拉·特纳（Ella Turner）——华盛顿某家妓院的“小姐”——听说自己的爱人谋杀了总统并逃走了之后，将他的照片紧紧握在心口，吞下了氯仿，倒地死亡。

但是，布斯是否从女人们潮水般的爱慕中得到了幸福感呢？几乎没有。因为他的成功局限于穷乡僻壤那些鉴赏能力不是很高的观众，但他野心勃勃，渴望得到大都市里高雅观众的赞赏。

但是纽约的评论家并不看重他，在费城他甚至被赶下了舞台。

这是非常难堪的，因为布斯家族其他成员都在舞台上取得了巨大成功。他的父亲朱尼厄斯·布鲁特斯·布斯（Junius Brutus Booth）是一流的戏剧巨星，红了将近三十年。他对莎士比亚戏剧人物的精妙诠释成了街谈巷议的话题。美国舞台剧历史上没有哪位明星像他那样受欢迎。老布斯精心培养自己最喜欢的儿子约翰·威尔克斯，一心认为他会成为布斯家族中最伟大的演员。

但是事实上，约翰·威尔克斯·布斯几乎没有继承他父亲的戏剧天赋，而且后天也没有为此努力。他长相俊美，为人骄纵又懒散，从不肯花心思好好学习。他的青年时代是在马背上度过的。那时的他整日骑着马在马里兰农场上的林子间横冲直撞，拿着一根在墨西哥战争中用过的旧战矛朝空中乱戳，对着树木和松鼠说些荒唐的豪言壮语。

老布斯不允许家里的餐桌上有肉，他告诉儿子们，杀生——即便是杀一条响尾蛇——也是不对的。但是约翰·威尔克斯·布斯很显然没有听从父亲的教诲。他喜欢射击和搞破坏。他喜欢鸣枪吓跑奴隶们养的猫和猎犬，有一次他还杀了邻居家的母猪。

之后，他成了切萨皮克湾上的一名“牡蛎海盗”，再后来成了演员。现在，他二十六岁，是懵懂的高中女生心中的白马王子，但在他自己眼中，他是个失败者。此外，他非常嫉妒自己的哥哥爱德温，因为爱德温拥有他梦寐以求的声望。

为此，他郁郁寡欢地思考了很久，最后决定做一件绝对能一夜成名的事。

他一开始的计划是这样的：尾随林肯进入剧院，趁他的同伙关掉煤气灯的时候冲进总统包厢，用绳子将林肯绑起来，将他扔到下面的舞台上，挟持他从后门离开，将他塞进马车，发狂似的趁着夜色迅速逃离。

经过一夜急行，他可以在黎明前到达仍沉睡着的古老小镇烟草港。然后他乘船横渡宽阔的波多马克河，接着一路向南穿过弗吉尼亚，最后安全地在南方军身后的里士满会见联盟军总司令。

然后呢？

然后南方便可以肆意定下条件，从而立刻结束战争。

这伟大的成就归功于谁呢？当然是那个耀眼的天才约翰·威尔克斯·布斯。他会因此名满天下，比他那有出息的哥哥还要出名一百倍。他会名垂青史，成为美国历史上的“威廉·退尔”(8)（William Tell）。这便是他的美梦。

当时他在剧院一年可赚两万美金，但他毫不犹豫地放弃了。现在，钱对他来说毫无意义，因为他正在做的事比获得财富重要多了。因此，他出钱资助了一帮徘徊在巴尔的摩和华盛顿附近的同情南方的人，并许诺他们会得到财富和名望。

那帮人无疑是一群乌合之众。斯潘格勒是一名捕蟹渔夫，也是个酒鬼，平时在剧院做后台工作。亚瑟特是个自大的油漆工，也是一名偷渡客。他毛发稀疏，是个粗鲁凶狠的家伙。阿诺德是一个懒惰的农场工，还是南方军的逃兵。欧劳福林在马车出租行工作，身上满是马和威士忌的味道。萨拉特是一个自命不凡的小职员。鲍威尔是一个大个子浑球儿，总是怒目圆睁，疯疯癫癫。他的爸爸是浸信会传教士。赫罗尔德是个喜欢傻笑的无业游民，整日待在马厩里吹牛谈女人，靠寡妇母亲和七个姐姐救济过活。

在这群最劣等配角的陪演下，布斯出演了自己职业生涯中最重要的角色。他花了大量时间和精力计划细节。他买了一副手铐，安排好了逃亡路上换马的地点。他买了三艘船，停在烟草港。他还安排了桨手，随时准备着带他们渡河。

终于，一八六五年一月，布斯相信那个伟大的时刻终于到了。整个城市都在传当月的十八号，林肯将去福特剧院观看爱德温·福莱斯特（Edwin Forrest）出演的《杰克·凯德》。布斯当然听到了这些传言，于是当晚，他带着绳子和期待去了剧院——然后发生了什么？什么都没发生。林肯没有出现。

两个月后，又有传言说，林肯将在某天下午出城前往附近的士兵之家观看戏剧表演。于是布斯和他的同伙跨上马背，带着博伊刀和左轮手枪，藏在总统必经之路旁的树丛里。可是当白宫的马车呼啸而过的时候，林肯并不在车内。

再次挫败的布斯愤怒极了，一边咒骂林肯，一边扯着自己漆黑的小胡子，拿马鞭抽打自己的靴子。他受够了。他再也不想失败了。如果不能抓住林肯，那就杀了他。

几个星期后，李投降了，战争也就此结束了。布斯认为，现在绑架总统已经没有任何意义了，因此他决定立刻暗杀总统。

这一次，布斯没有等很久。战争结束后的第二个周五，布斯理了发，随后便前往福特剧院拿他的邮件。他得知当晚总统预订了一个包间。

“不是吧！”他大声说道，“那个卑鄙的无赖今晚要来？”

舞台工作人员正在为演出做准备。他们用有花边的旗子覆盖左边的一个包厢，在包厢里面挂上华盛顿的画像，移除隔断，扩大空间，贴上深红色的墙纸，还在包厢里放了一张大号的胡桃木摇椅，这样总统的长腿便可以伸直了。

布斯贿赂了一名舞台工作人员，让其将摇椅按照他的要求摆放。他希望摇椅放在靠观众的一侧，这样就不会有人看见他潜入了。他在摇椅后面的内门上钻了一个窥视孔，接着又在特等座通往包厢的门后的石灰墙上挖了一个缺口，这样他便可以用一根木条把这个入口堵起来。做完了这些后，布斯回到了旅馆，给《国民通讯员报》的编辑写了一封长信，并以爱国之名为自己有预谋的暗杀行为进行了辩护，并宣称后世子孙会以他为荣。他签好名后将信交给了一名演员，关照他第二天拿去发表。

接着他去了一家马车出租行，雇了一匹据说“跑得和猫一样快”的深棕色母马。他将手下人集合起来，给他们一人配了一匹马。他给了亚瑟特一把枪，让他枪杀副总统。他给了鲍威尔一把枪和一把刀，命令他暗杀苏华德。

当晚是耶稣受难日，照理来说是剧院一年中最惨淡的日子，但是当晚，城里挤满了想要一睹联邦军总司令风采的军官和士兵，整个城市都在庆贺战争结束，一派喜气洋洋。宾夕法尼亚大街上的凯旋门还没有移除，街上满是拿着火把的舞蹈队列。当总统骑马经过时，路旁的人群里发出了热烈的欢呼声。林肯到达福特剧院的时候，剧院已经人满为患，成百上千的观众被拒之门外。

总统一行人是在第一幕开演后不久入的场，准确时间是八点四十分。演员们向总统鼓掌鞠躬，身着盛装的观众爆发出热烈的欢呼声，管弦乐队适时地奏起《领袖万岁》。林肯鞠躬致谢，然后脱下燕尾服，坐在有着红色垫子的胡桃木摇椅上。

林肯夫人的右手边坐着她的客人，宪兵司令办公室的拉斯伯恩少校以及他的未婚妻克拉拉·哈里斯（Clara H．Harris）小姐。哈里斯小姐是纽约州参议员伊拉·哈里斯的女儿，是一位蓝血贵族。在华盛顿社交圈里，她的身份足够满足那位来自肯塔基州的女主人挑剔的要求。

劳拉·基恩（Laura Keene）正在表演流行喜剧《我们的美国表弟》的最后一幕。这是非常欢乐的一幕，观众席间爆笑声此起彼伏。

当天下午，林肯和他的夫人骑了很久的马。林肯夫人后来说这些年来从来没有见过林肯像那天下午那样快乐。他有什么理由不快乐？和平、胜利、团结、自由，都有了。那天下午，他和玛丽谈起第二任任期结束离开白宫后的打算。

首先，去欧洲或者加州好好休息一段时间。度假回来后也许会在芝加哥开一家律师事务所，或者回到春田市，将余生都奉献给他热爱的草原巡回法庭。那天下午，他将几位伊利诺伊州的老朋友请到了白宫，他兴奋地和朋友们讲着笑话，以至于吃晚饭的时候林肯夫人都请不动他。

前一天晚上，他做了一个奇怪的梦。那天早上他和内阁说起了那个梦：“我仿佛在一艘无法描述的小船上。船快速地朝着远处黑暗模糊的海岸驶去。每次发生大事前我都会做这个梦。安蒂特姆河之战、石河之战、葛底斯堡之战、维克斯堡之战前我都做过这个梦。”

他认为这个梦是一个好兆头，会带来好消息。他认为会有好事发生。




十点十分的时候，因为喝威士忌而满脸通红的布斯穿着黑色的马裤、皮靴和马刺，人生中最后一次走进了剧院，很快便看到了总统。布斯手里拿着一顶宽边软帽，走上通往特等座的台阶，挤过一条放满了椅子的走道，然后来到了通往包厢的走廊。

总统的保镖拦下了他。布斯自信地递过一张自己的名片，声称总统想要见他。接着，未等保镖同意便推门而入，随即关上走廊的门，并用乐谱架上的立柱从里面将门抵住。

通过总统身后内门上的窥视孔，他计算了一下距离，然后悄悄地把门打开。他将上了膛的高口径短筒手枪靠近受害人的头部，扣动扳机，然后立刻跳到了下方的舞台上。

林肯的头猛地向前垂下，然后又歪向一边。与此同时他的身体也瘫倒在椅子里。

他没有发出任何声音。

一瞬间，观众以为枪声和重物落在舞台上的声音也是一场表演。没有人——甚至演员——想到总统被暗杀了。

接着，剧院上空划过一声女人的尖叫，所有人的目光都转向挂着旗子的包厢。拉斯伯恩少校的一只手臂上满是鲜血，他大声喊道：“拿下那个男人！拿下那个男人！他杀了总统！”

整个剧院一瞬间安静了下来。一缕青烟从总统包间飘了出来。悬念解开了。观众发狂了。他们从座位上冲了出来，猛砸地板上的椅子，破坏栏杆，试图冲上舞台。他们互相推搡，老弱被踩在脚下，很多人在冲撞中骨折了，女人们尖叫着晕倒了。痛苦的叫声中夹杂着愤怒的狂吼——“绞死他！”“杀了他！”“烧了剧院！”

有人喊着应该把剧院炸掉。惊慌失措的人们心中的愤怒成倍成倍地增长。一连疯狂的士兵快步冲进剧院，拿着步枪和刺刀指着观众，大喊道：“出去！说你呢！出去！”

观众里的医生赶来检查林肯的伤势。医生认为总统生命垂危，经不起回白宫的路上的鹅卵石地面的颠簸，于是四名士兵将林肯抬了起来——两人抬着他的肩膀，两人抬着他的脚——然后将他那松垂的颀长身躯搬出了剧院。士兵们抬着林肯走在街道上，他伤口上滴下的血染红了马路，人们纷纷跪下用手帕擦拭地上的血迹——他们或许会将这块手帕珍藏起来，去世前将它作为传家之宝留给自己的子孙。

配备着闪亮的军刀和矫健马匹的骑兵队在人群中清出了一片空地，几双颤抖的手扶着病危的总统穿过街道来到街对面的一间简陋的公寓。他们将林肯颀长的身躯斜着放在屋内一张中间凹陷的床上。即便如此，这张床对于林肯来说还是太短了。接着他们将床拖到了一盏闪烁着黄光的昏暗的煤气灯旁。

这间屋子的主人是一个裁缝。这间屋子大约只有九乘十七英尺大小，床头挂着罗莎·博纳尔（Rosa Bonheur）的《马展》，是一幅廉价赝品。

林肯被刺杀的消息像龙卷风般席卷了华盛顿。接着又传来了其他的噩耗：在林肯遇袭的同时，国务卿苏华德也在床上被捅了一刀，大概也活不了了。在这些黑暗的事实面前，恐怖的谣言像连环闪电一样袭击着黑夜：副总统约翰逊被杀了，斯坦顿也被暗杀了，格兰特受到了枪击。一时间，谣言四起。

现在人们可以肯定，李的投降是一场阴谋，南方联盟的叛徒们已经潜入了华盛顿，意欲毁掉联邦政府，而南方的军队再次挥刀而来，即将发起比之前更惨烈的战争。

神秘的信使们穿梭在住宅区之间，短击地面两次，再重复三次——这是联邦同盟会的危急信号。听到召唤后，成员们拿起来复枪，疯狂地涌上街道。

整个城市满是高举火把的人，他们群情激奋，咆哮着：“烧了剧院！”“绞死叛徒！”“杀光叛军！”

这是美国历史上前所未有的疯狂之夜。

电报将消息快速地传遍全国，因此，全国人民的情绪都十分激昂。人们将同情南方和支持南方的北方人架在围栏上，在他们身上抹上焦油，再插上羽毛。还有一些人被铺路石活活砸烂了头骨。人们砸了巴尔的摩的照相馆，因为他们相信里面有布斯的照片。马里兰的一位编辑因为公开诽谤林肯遭到了枪杀。

现在，总统性命垂危，副总统约翰逊趴在床上不省人事，国务卿苏华德遇刺后也挣扎在死亡边缘，于是权力便牢牢地掌握在了粗暴、古怪又易怒的战争部长爱德华·斯坦顿手中。

斯坦顿认为，现在政府的顶级官员都被钉上了死亡的标签，于是他雷厉风行地下达了一道又一道命令。他坐在濒死的领袖床前，将这些命令写在了自己的丝帽上。他命令士兵包围布斯和他同事的住所。他查抄福特剧院，逮捕了所有涉嫌人员。他宣布华盛顿进入戒严状态。他调动了所有可以调动的力量：哥伦比亚区所有的兵力和警力，周边所有营地和防御工事的兵力，美国特工处以及军事司法局下属的间谍。他在全市范围内实行五十英尺一哨岗的封锁政策。他派人盯紧每一个码头，并命令拖船、蒸汽船和炮艇沿着波多马克河巡逻。

斯坦顿给纽约警察总长发电报，要求他即刻派出手下最优秀的侦探。他以电报的形式命令手下密切注意加拿大边境的情况。他命令巴尔的摩和俄亥俄铁路公司的主席乘坐辅助机车赶上格兰特的火车，在费城拦住格兰特并立即将他带回华盛顿。

他派出一个旅的步兵进入马里兰腹地，又派了一千骑兵追捕杀害总统的凶手。他一遍又一遍地说：“他肯定会往南方跑，从城里开始一直到波多马克河，全给我守住了！”




布斯射出的那枚子弹从林肯的左耳下方进入，斜穿过大脑，最后嵌在右眼旁半寸的地方。若是生命力不顽强的人，一定会当场死亡，但是林肯却坚持了九个小时。他就这样躺在床上，不断痛苦地呻吟着。

林肯夫人被安置在旁边的房间里，但每隔一个小时她就坚持要去林肯床边，一边哭一边尖声喊叫着：“上帝啊，是不是我害死了我的丈夫？”

有一次，当她一边将满是泪水的脸颊枕在林肯胸口，一边爱抚林肯脸庞的时候，林肯突然呻吟起来，大口大口地喘息。发狂的林肯夫人尖叫着跳到一旁，跌倒在地上，然后晕了过去。

听到动静的斯坦顿冲进了房间。他愤怒地吼道：“把这个女人拉走，不许她再进来！”

七点钟过后，呻吟声停止了，林肯的呼吸声也趋于平静。“他那疲惫的脸上露出了一种无法言说的平静。”林肯的秘书这样写道。

有的时候，人在弥留之际，神秘的意识海中会有记忆的碎片。

在那最后的平静时刻，也许那藏在心灵深处的破碎的幸福记忆会浮现在他的脑海中——那是很久以前早已消失的画面：印第安纳鹿角谷里的敞篷木屋前，温暖的柴火正在熊熊燃烧；咆哮的桑加蒙河从新塞勒姆村的水闸上奔腾而过；安·拉特利奇在纺车旁唱着歌曲；“老公鹿”嘶鸣着想要再多吃点玉米；奥兰多·凯洛格正在讲着那个口吃法官的故事；还有春田市那个墙上满是墨水印、书架顶端长着野草的法律事务所的办公室……

在林肯与死亡斗争的几个小时内，利尔军医一直握着总统的手，坐在他的身旁。七点二十二分，利尔医生将林肯那没有脉搏的手臂叠放在他的胸前，然后将两枚五角硬币放在他眼睑上，再用一块手帕绑住他的下巴。牧师做了祷告。冷雨吧嗒吧嗒地拍打着屋顶。巴恩斯将军扯过一块床单，盖在已逝的总统脸上。斯坦顿一边哭着一边拉下百叶窗，不让晨光照进屋里。接着他说出了那晚唯一一句值得纪念的话：“现在，他属于千秋万代。”

第二天，小泰德问一位白宫访客，父亲是否去了天堂。

“这是毫无疑问的。”对方这样回答道。

“那样的话，我很开心他去了，”泰德说，“自从来到这里，他一点儿也不快乐。这里对他来说不是一个好地方。”

载着林肯遗体的送葬列车穿过一波又一波哀悼的人群，缓缓地向伊利诺伊州驶去。列车上盖着一层厚厚的绉纱，列车引擎则像驮棺木的马儿一样披上了一条点缀着银色星星的黑色毯子。

当列车一路向北驶去的时候，铁路旁出现了越来越多充满了悲伤的脸庞。

列车离费城车站还有数英里的时候，铁路两旁的人便站成了一堵堵厚厚的人墙。当列车入城的时候，成千上万的民众涌上街头，将马路挤得水泄不通。独立大厅的哀悼者们排成的长队绵延了三英里。他们缓缓地一寸一寸地向前移动，坚持了数十小时，只为最后再瞻仰一眼林肯的面容。到了周六午夜，公共场所的门都要关闭，但是哀悼的人群不愿散去，在原地站了一晚。到周日凌晨三点的时候，等候的人群前所未有的庞大，男孩们以十美金的价格向外出售他们所在的位置。

数百位妇女晕倒了，许多参加过葛底斯堡战役的老兵在努力维持秩序时也晕倒了，士兵和骑着马的警察们尽力疏通着道路。按照计划，葬礼将在纽约举行。

在葬礼开始前二十四个小时，游览列车便日夜不停地将一波又一波的民众运送了过来。纽约从来没有过这么大的客流量——人们先占据了所有的旅馆，接着是民宿，最后是公园和蒸汽船码头。

第二天，十六名黑人骑着十六匹白色的骏马，拉着灵柩沿着百老汇大街缓缓而行。女人们陷入了疯狂的悲伤之中，纷纷将手中的鲜花扔到灵车前方的道路上。灵车后面传来沉重的脚步声——十六万哀悼者列队跟随着灵车前行。他们手中摇曳着旗帜，旗帜上写着：“啊！多么可惜啊！埃古——多么可惜啊！”(1)……“你们要休息，要知道我是神。”(2)

五十万观众争先恐后地相互推搡，只为看一看那长长的送葬队伍。百老汇大街两旁对着街面的二楼靠窗处，每个位子要四十美金的租金。为了容纳更多人，那些窗户的玻璃都被拆掉了。

身着白袍的唱诗班站在街角唱着赞美诗；军乐队奏着悲伤的哀歌；每隔六十秒，城市上空便会响起一百门加农炮的轰隆声。

林肯的灵柩放在纽约市政厅，哭泣的人群围绕在他周围，有的和他说话，有的试图触摸他的脸庞。一位妇女趁警卫不注意的时候弯下腰亲吻了林肯的遗体。

周二中午，林肯的棺木合上了。成千上万个没能瞻仰林肯遗容的人立刻向西朝着送葬列车预计停留的几个城市涌去。在去往春田市的路上，送葬列车无时无刻不被肃穆的钟声和轰鸣的礼炮声包围。白天，送葬列车在常青藤和鲜花扎成的拱门下穿梭，在孩子们挥舞着旗帜的山坡旁疾驰。晚上，为送葬列车照明的火把和篝火照亮了几乎半个北美大陆。

整个国家陷入了疯狂。历史上还从未有过如此盛大的葬礼。到处都有脆弱的民众因为过度伤心而倒下。纽约的一位年轻人哭喊着“我要去陪亚伯拉罕·林肯”，随后便用剃刀抹了脖子。

暗杀发生四十八小时后，春田市的一个委员会匆忙赶到了华盛顿，恳请林肯夫人同意将她的丈夫安葬在家乡。一开始，林肯夫人是坚决不同意的。她在春田市几乎没有朋友。她自己也很清楚这一点。确实，她在春田市有三个姐妹，但她十分讨厌其中两个，对剩下的那个又充满了鄙视。在林肯夫人心里，她根本就看不起那个流传着闲言碎语的小镇。

“上帝啊，伊丽莎白！”她对自己的黑人裁缝说，“我绝不再回春田市。”

于是她计划将林肯安葬在芝加哥，或者安葬在国会大厦原本为乔治·华盛顿建造的坟墓中。

然而，委员会恳求了林肯夫人七天，最终让她同意将林肯的遗体带回春田市。春田市设立了一个公共基金会，买下了一片包含了四个城市街区的美丽土地——这块地现在已成为了州议会大厦——并派人日夜不停地赶工建造墓园。

最终，送葬列车在五月四日的时候缓缓驶入春田市。墓园已完工，数千名林肯的旧识相聚一堂，准备参加林肯的葬礼。可是性情古怪的林肯夫人却突然取消了所有计划，不准林肯下葬在刚建好的墓地，并傲慢地下令将林肯的遗体葬入两英里外的橡树岭公墓。

没有商量余地，林肯夫人发狠说，如果不按照她的要求做，她就要用“暴力”方式将林肯的遗体带回华盛顿。林肯夫人为什么要这么做呢？原因十分令人厌恶：建在春田市中心的墓园所在的土地被称为“马瑟街”，而林肯夫人看不起马瑟家族。数年前，马瑟家族的人不知怎的惹怒了林肯夫人，于是现在，即便在肃静的死亡面前，她仍旧对旧时的仇怨耿耿于怀，甚至不愿林肯的遗体在被马瑟家族污染过的土地上待哪怕是一夜。

这个女人与她那“对任何人都毫无恶意”、“对所有人都心怀怜悯”的丈夫在同一屋檐下共同生活了二十五年，但就像法国的波旁王朝的国王一样，她什么也没学会，只记住了所有的仇恨。

春田市不得不向这位遗孀屈服，于是十一点的时候，林肯的遗体被移了出来，放在了橡树岭公墓的公共纳骨堂。“斗士乔·胡克”骑马走在棺木前面，“老公鹿”跟在棺木后面，身上披着一条红白蓝相间的毯子，毯子上绣着“老亚伯的爱驹”。

待“老公鹿”回到马厩时，它身上的毯子连碎片都不见了。争夺纪念品的人们早已将它洗劫一空。他们像秃鹰一样朝着棺木扑去，争夺、撕抢着覆盖在棺木上的殓布，直到端着刺刀的士兵向他们冲去才罢手。




林肯遭遇暗杀后，林肯夫人日夜哭泣，整整五个星期躺在白宫的房间里不出门。

那段时间，伊丽莎白·凯克利一直陪伴在林肯夫人身边。她写道：

我永远也忘不了那个场景：伤心欲绝的恸哭声，可怕的尖叫声，恐怖的抽搐，还有来自灵魂深处悲痛的宣泄。我用冷水为林肯夫人洗头，尽我所能地抚慰她悲伤的心灵。

对于父亲的去世，泰德的伤心并不比他母亲少。但林肯夫人可怕的情绪把孩子吓得一言不发……

晚上的时候，泰德听到母亲的哭泣声后便会起床，穿着他的白色睡衣来到她的床边安慰她：“妈妈，别哭了。你哭得我睡不着。爸爸是个好人，他去了天堂。他在那里很快乐。他和上帝以及威利哥哥在一起。妈妈，别哭了，否则我也要哭了。”

在布斯朝林肯开枪的瞬间，当时和总统一起坐在包厢里的拉斯伯恩少校便立刻跳起来抓住了刺客。但他还是让刺客逃脱了，因为布斯用博伊刀狠狠地划了他一刀，在他的手臂上留下了一道很深的伤痕。逃脱了拉斯伯恩少校的控制后，布斯跃上包厢的扶手，然后跳到十二英尺下的舞台上。但是他往下跳的时候，脚上的马刺勾到了覆盖在总统包厢上的旗帜，因此他摔得十分狼狈，并摔断了左腿。

钻心的疼痛瞬间击穿了他。但他没有退缩，也没有犹豫。他现在正扮演着职业生涯中最为重要的角色——他将因为这一幕而名垂青史。

布斯很快反应过来，他挥舞着匕首，喊出了弗吉尼亚的座右铭：这就是暴君的下场。他闯入舞台，刺伤了一名无意中挡在他面前的乐师，放倒了一位女演员，从后门窜了出去，跃上早已等在那里的马，抡起左轮手枪，用枪托砸晕了帮他看马的“皮纳德·约翰”，然后不要命似的骑马狂奔起来。在夜空的映衬下，只见马儿的铁掌在鹅卵石地上敲击出了阵阵火花。

布斯在城里狂奔两英里，穿过了国会大厦。当月亮升至树梢的时候，他迅速策马来到横跨安那考斯迪亚河的桥上。联邦军的哨兵科布中士举着来复枪和刺刀冲了出来。他质问道：

“你是谁？为什么这么晚出来？你不知道九点过后不得通行吗？”

说来奇怪，布斯坦白地说了自己的真名，说自己住在查尔斯县，这次来城里是为了做生意，现在特意等月亮升起来后借着月光回家。

布斯的说辞听起来有些道理，再加上现在战争已经结束了，没必要小题大做。于是科布中士放下了来复枪，给布斯放行。

几分钟后，布斯的同伙赫罗尔德用类似的理由也通过了安那考斯迪亚河，并与布斯在约定地点会面。接着，两人穿过马里兰边界向南飞驰，梦想着回到南方时会受到南方各州的盛赞。

午夜时候，他们来到了萨拉特所在的小镇，在一家小酒馆门前停了下来。他们给大口喘着粗气的马儿喂了水，拿走了当天下午萨拉特夫人放在那里的望远镜、枪支和弹药。他们喝了一美金威士忌，宣称他们已经暗杀了林肯，连夜飞奔到这里。

他们原本计划从这里直接前往波托马克河，争取在次日凌晨时分到达，然后立刻乘船驶向弗吉尼亚州。这听起来很容易，他们完全可以做到，也永远不会被抓住，但是他们忘记了一件事。在原先的计划里，布斯并没有摔断腿。

那天晚上，布斯强忍着疼痛，以斯巴达式的坚忍不停地向前奔驰，即便断裂的腿骨——按照他在日记中所说——“随着马每走一步都传来撕心裂肺的痛感”。终于，布斯再也坚持不下去了。他和赫罗尔德不得不向左勒转马头，在周六破晓前来到了乡村医生塞缪尔·莫德（Samuel A．Mudd）门前。他的家在华盛顿东南二十英里处。

布斯非常虚弱，他处于极度的疼痛中，甚至不能自行下马。他被抬下马鞍，抬进了二楼的卧室。一路上他一直在呻吟。在那个与世隔绝的地方，没有电报也没有火车，因此谁也不知道林肯被暗杀的事。于是，医生并未怀疑。布斯的腿是怎么伤的？很简单，按照布斯的解释，他坠马了。莫德医生像对待其他伤患一样处理布斯的伤：他切开布斯左脚的靴子，将断骨复位，将帽盒上的硬纸板拆下来固定在断骨处，做了一根简易拐杖，最后又给了布斯一双鞋。

布斯在莫德医生家里睡了一天。黄昏时分，他强忍着痛苦从床上爬了起来。他没吃东西，刮掉了帅气的胡子，在肩膀上围了一条很长的灰色围巾。围巾边缘正好可以遮住他右手上那个泄露自己身份的名字缩写文身。他粘上了一套假胡子，并付给医生二十五美金。接着他和赫罗尔德再次跨上马背，朝着他们的希望之河奔去。

但是，挡在他们面前的是著名的泽基沼泽。沼泽里落了很多灌木和山茱萸，渗出的泥水聚成了一个个死水塘——那里是蜥蜴和蛇的家园。布斯和赫罗尔德在黑暗中迷路了，他们沿着沼泽边缘徘徊了数小时。

后半夜的时候，黑人奥斯瓦德·斯万（Oswald Swann）救了他们。布斯被腿上的疼痛折磨着，甚至做不到好好地坐在马上。于是，给了斯万七美金后，他便在斯万的马车里度过了夜晚余下的时间。在复活节的黎明到来之际，斯万将自己白色的骡子停在了“里奇山”前。这里住着一位富有而著名的南方党人——考克斯上尉。

就这样，布斯结束了自己逃命行程的第一阶段。

布斯告诉了考克斯上尉自己是谁，做了什么事。为了证明自己的身份，他露出了右手上用墨汁纹的名字缩写文身。

他恳求考克斯上尉以母亲的名义发誓不会背叛他。他说自己很虚弱，腿脚不便，承受着很大的痛苦，并宣称自己做了自认为对南方来说最好的事。

现在，布斯不管是骑马还是坐马车，都无法远行。因此考克斯上尉将这两个逃犯藏在了他家旁边的松林中。那片土地与其说是松林，倒不如说是一片野生的丛林，里面草木横生，松树下方还长满了月桂和冬青。接下来的六天五夜，两个逃犯便藏在此处，等待着布斯的腿伤恢复至能够继续上路的程度。

考克斯上尉有一个义兄，名叫托马斯·琼斯（Thomas A．Jones），是一位奴隶主，数年来一直是南方联盟的特工，曾多次帮助逃亡者横渡波托马克河，并私下为南方联盟越过波托马克河传递邮件。考克斯上尉请琼斯去照顾布斯和赫罗尔德，因此每天早上他都会提着一个篮子为他们送饭。他知道每条道路都在搜查中，并且到处都是特工，因此每次送饭的时候，他总是带着猪一起出门，看上去就像去喂猪一样。

布斯虽然渴望食物，但是更渴望得到消息。他不断地恳求琼斯告诉他最新的消息，迫切想知道整个国家正用何种方式为他的壮举喝彩。

琼斯给布斯拿来了最新的报纸，布斯如饥似渴地翻看着，却发现上面并没有他做梦都想得到的赞扬。布斯非常伤心，心中充满了幻灭感。

布斯曾强忍着肉体上的疼痛，向弗吉尼亚狂奔三十个小时。可是现在，和布斯正经受着的内心的痛苦相比，那肉体的疼痛似乎变得没那么难以忍受了。北方很愤怒——这没什么，他早已预料到。但是当他看到弗吉尼亚的报纸上说南方——他的南方——背叛了他，正在谴责他、与他撇清关系时，他陷入了失望和绝望的疯狂之中。他曾梦想自己会成为第二个布鲁特斯(3)，成为现代的威廉·退尔，成为受万众尊崇的伟人，但是现在却成了一个备受谴责的懦夫、蠢蛋，一个为钱卖命的小人，一个十恶不赦的杀人犯。

面对这些攻击，布斯就像被蝰蛇咬了一口般疼痛，甚至比死亡还难受。

但是他有没有自责过呢？当然没有。相反，他把这一切怪罪于除他和上帝以外的所有人。他是全能的上帝的工具——这便是他为自己的辩护。他在上帝的授意下枪杀亚伯拉罕·林肯，他唯一的错误是他一直在为“堕落至极”从而无法理解他的壮举的人民效劳。“堕落至极”这四个字是他日记中的原话。

“如果世界能明白我的心，”他写道，“那么那一枪便会让我永垂不朽，虽然我并不刻意追求伟大……我那伟大的灵魂不允许我作为一个罪犯死去。”

布斯躲在泽基沼泽周边的区域，躺在一条马鞍褥下瑟瑟发抖。他用悲剧式的夸张言辞宣泄着内心的痛苦：

潮湿，寒冷，饥饿，千夫所指。我身处绝望之中。为什么会这样？因为我做了一件伟大的事，一个让布鲁特斯备受尊崇、让退尔成为英雄的伟大举措。我除掉了一位前所未有的暴君，可他们却将我看作是普通的杀人犯。我的行为比他们任何人都要高洁……我并不奢求回报……我认为我做得很好。我并不后悔开了那一枪。

就在布斯蜷缩着写日记的时候，三千名侦探和一万名骑兵正在对马里兰南部的每一个角落进行地毯式搜索。他们挨家挨户地盘查，不放过每一个洞穴和每一处建筑。他们甚至还搜索了泥泞的泽基沼泽。他们下定决心要将布斯抓捕归案，活要见人死要见尸。为了抓捕布斯，他们还发布了十万美金的悬赏。有时候，布斯都能听到抓捕他的骑兵从距离他两百码的公路上疾驰而过。

有时，他能听到周围的马儿嘶鸣着呼唤同伴。布斯想，他和赫罗尔德的马也许会回应外面的那些马，那就意味着他们会暴露。于是当天晚上赫罗尔德牵着他们的马来到沼泽，然后枪杀了它们。

两天后，死马的尸体引来了秃鹫。一开始天空中只有几个小黑点，渐渐地秃鹫越飞越近，不停地在空中盘旋，最后直奔死马的尸体而去。布斯非常害怕，因为秃鹫可能会引起追捕者的注意，而那些追捕者肯定一眼就能认出那匹深棕色母马是他的。

此外，他也意识到自己必须去看医生。

于是第二天晚上——四月二十一日星期五，暗杀发生一周后——布斯的同伙将他从地上抬起来，扶他跨上了托马斯·琼斯的马。布斯和赫罗尔德再次踏上了前往波托马克河的逃亡之路。

那天晚上的情况非常适合逃亡：空气中弥漫着浓重的雾气，夜色如墨水般漆黑，只有靠触摸才能感受到身旁的人。

琼斯很忠诚，领着他们从藏身处前往波托马克河。他们快步穿过田野，越过公路，接着穿过一片农场。到处都是士兵和特工处的人，于是开路的琼斯每次只向前走五十码，然后停下来听一听周边的动静，确认安全后吹一记低沉的口哨，布斯和赫罗尔德便再跟上。

一路上，任何风吹草动都能让他们胆战心惊。就这样走了几个小时后，他们终于到达了那条通向波托马克河的崎岖山路。那天风势猛烈，河水在茫茫夜色中拍打沙滩的声音清晰可闻。

一个星期以来，联邦的士兵们踏遍了波托马克河沿岸的每一寸土地，摧毁了马里兰沿岸所有的船只。但是道高一尺魔高一丈，琼斯让自己的黑奴亨利·罗兰（Henry Rowland）每天白天驾船捕捞鲱鱼，晚上再将船藏在草场里。

因此，那天晚上当布斯和赫罗尔德到达水边的时候，一切都已准备就绪。布斯小声地对琼斯表达感谢，花十七美金买下了琼斯的船和一瓶威士忌，接着便爬进船舱，朝着五英里外的弗吉尼亚进发。

在笼罩着浓雾的夜色中，赫罗尔德用力地划着桨，布斯则坐在船尾，拿着指南针和蜡烛辨别方向。

然而，因为河道狭窄，他们没走多久便遇到了大涨潮。涌动的潮水将船向上游推进了几英里，一时间他们在浓雾中迷失了方向。他们忙着躲避波托马克河上巡逻的联邦炮艇，等到了黎明的时候发现已经向上游漂了十英里，但是和头一天晚上相比，根本没有靠近弗吉尼亚河岸一步。

于是，接下来的一天他们一直躲在纳杰莫尔湾（Nanjemoy Cove）的沼泽里，直到第二天晚上，浑身湿透又饱尝饥饿的逃犯才最终渡过了波托马克河。布斯兴奋地喊道：“感谢上帝！我终于来到了古老而充满荣耀的弗吉尼亚！我终于安全了！”

他们奔向理查德·斯图尔特医生（Richard Stewart）的家。斯图尔特是南方联盟政府的人，也是弗吉尼亚州乔治王县的首富。布斯本以为自己会以南方救世主的身份受到热烈的欢迎，但是斯图尔特医生曾因帮助南方联盟而被逮捕了好几次，现在战争结束了，他自然犯不着冒着生命危险帮助暗杀了林肯的人。对于布斯的求助，医生非常警觉，甚至不允许布斯进入自己的房子。他勉强给了布斯和赫罗尔德一点儿食物，并把他们赶到谷仓吃饭。晚上便让他们去一个黑人家过夜。

甚至黑人一家也不欢迎布斯。布斯不得不用恐吓的方式迫使黑人一家答应让他留宿。

这便是弗吉尼亚对待布斯的态度！

布斯曾满心期待地认为，在弗吉尼亚，只要提到他的名字，山野间便会回荡着人们响亮的欢呼声。

三天后，布斯迎来了自己的死期。布斯并没有走很远。他在三名返乡的联盟骑兵的陪同下从皇家港渡过了拉帕汉诺克河，然后跨上骑兵的马，向南奔驰了三英里。在骑兵们的帮助下，他骗过了一位名叫加勒特的农民，谎称自己叫博伊德，是李将军的手下，在里士满附近受了伤。

接下来的两天，他便住在加勒特的农舍里。布斯躺在草地上晒着太阳，一边承受着伤口带来的剧痛，一边查看地图，寻找去格兰德河的路线以及前往墨西哥的道路。

在布斯来到农舍那天晚上，吃晚饭的时候，加勒特的小女儿喋喋不休地谈论着刚从邻居那儿听到的总统被暗杀的消息。她不停地说着，猜想着到底是谁做了这件事，又收了多少钱的好处。

“在我看来，”布斯突然插话道，“他一分钱也没收。他这么做只是为了出名而已。”

第二天，也就是四月二十五日下午，当布斯和赫罗尔德正躺在加勒特院子里的刺槐树下晒太阳时，曾帮助他们渡过拉帕汉诺克河的拉格尔斯少校突然冲上前来朝他们喊道：“北方佬正在过河，你们小心些。”

布斯和赫罗尔德急忙躲进了树林，直到晚上才偷偷回到农舍。

在加勒特看来，他们两人十分可疑。他想摆脱那两个“神秘的客人”。加勒特猜到了布斯就是暗杀林肯的凶手？当然没有。他从来没有想过这一点。他以为他们是偷马贼，而当他们在晚饭的时候说想买两匹马的时候，加勒特心中的怀疑便更深了。到了睡觉时间，考虑到安全问题，两个逃犯拒绝去楼上睡觉，他们坚持睡在门廊下或谷仓里。至此，一切都毫无疑问了。

现在，加勒特确信他们就是偷马贼。于是加勒特让他们住进了存放干草和家具的烟草仓库，待他们进去后用挂锁从外面将门锁住。为防万一，这位老农让自己的两个儿子威廉和亨利趁着夜色，蹑手蹑脚地带着毯子住到布斯隔壁的玉米仓库，看着自家的马，不要在夜里被那两个客人牵走了。

在那具有纪念意义的夜晚，加勒特一家人带着些许忐忑上床就寝了。

第二天早上，他们的这份忐忑便得到了回应。

两天两夜以来，联邦士兵们锲而不舍地追踪着布斯和赫罗尔德。他们一路搜集线索，通过一个目击布斯横渡波托马克河的黑人找到了罗林斯——那个撑着一艘驳船帮助布斯他们偷偷渡过拉帕汉诺克河的黑人。罗林斯告诉联邦士兵，帮助布斯他们从拉帕汉诺克河骑马逃走的人是维利·杰特上尉（Willie Jett）。杰特有一个情人住在十二英里外的鲍林格林市，他有可能在那里。

这些信息已经足够了。骑兵们迅速跨上马鞍，在月色下赶往鲍林格林。他们在午夜时分到达了目的地，雷霆般冲入屋内，找到了杰特上尉，将他从床上拽了起来，用左轮手枪顶着他的肋骨，问道：

“布斯在哪里？狗杂种，你把他藏到哪里去了？不说的话我一枪毙了你！”

杰特跨上他的马，领着北方人再次来到加勒特农场。

那晚夜黑风高，月亮隐在云层中，天上看不到任何星星。他们骑马跑了九英里，马蹄扬起的尘土久久不散。杰特上尉被两名士兵一左一右夹在中间，他的缰绳也被系在北方士兵的马鞍上，以防他趁着夜色逃跑。

凌晨三点半，骑兵们到达了加勒特家那陈旧的、白色的房子外。

他们安静又迅速地包围了整栋房子，用枪口对准每一扇门窗。指挥官用枪托狠狠地砸着院门，勒令里面的人开门。

没过多久，理查德·加勒特在激烈的狗吠声中举着蜡烛打开了门闩。加勒特身着长睡衣，衣角在风的吹动下不断地拍打着他那颤抖的双腿。

贝克中尉一把抓住他的脖子，用手枪顶着他的脑袋，勒令他交出布斯。

加勒特非常害怕，结结巴巴地发誓布斯不在自己家里，说他们逃到树林里去了。

这是谎言，而且听起来就很像谎言。因此骑兵一把将加勒特拽出门，在他脖子上缠上绳子，威胁他要立刻将他吊死在院子里的刺槐树上。

就在这时，加勒特睡在玉米仓库里的儿子跑了出来，告诉了骑兵们真相。于是骑兵们立刻包围了烟草仓库。

开枪之前双方对话了很久。北方军官和布斯理论了约十五至二十分钟，他们要求布斯投降。布斯回答说自己“是个瘸子”，要求北方士兵“给瘸子一个表现机会”，如果他们愿意撤退一百码，他愿意出来和他们一对一单挑。

赫罗尔德害怕了，想要投降。布斯非常生气。

“你这个该死的懦夫，”布斯喊道，“滚出去！我不需要你待在这里。”

赫罗尔德走出了仓库，双手放在身前，准备束手就擒。他恳求他们宽恕自己，他说自己喜欢林肯的笑话，并发誓说没有参与暗杀林肯。

康格上校将他绑在树上，威胁说他再胡言乱语便将他的嘴堵上。

但是布斯拒绝投降。他觉得自己是在做造福子孙后代的事情。他对外面的追兵说他的字典里没有“投降”这个词，还要求他们“再一次抹黑昔日的光荣”时为他的尸体准备一副担架。

康格上校想出了烟熏的办法，他命令加勒特的儿子在仓库周围堆上干枯的灌木。布斯看到男孩忙碌的身影后发狠咒骂起来，并威胁男孩若不停下便一枪打穿他。男孩停了下来。但此时，康格上校已溜到了仓库后面的角落里，从墙缝中塞了一捆干草进去，并用火柴点燃了。

这个仓库本是储存烟草用的，因此墙上留下了一排四英寸宽的通风口。透过这些通风口，只见布斯正借助一张桌子对抗愈烧愈旺的火——这是一个演员最后一次在众人面前表演，也是一个悲剧演员告别演出的最后一幕。

上头下了死命令，要活捉布斯。政府不希望布斯悄无声息地死去。政府希望为他召开一场盛大的审判，然后当众绞死他。

若不是那位脑子有些不正常的宗教狂热分子波士顿·科贝特中士，布斯大概是能被生擒的。

每一位士兵都被反复告诫，没有命令不得擅自开枪。事后科贝特声称自己得到了命令——来自上帝的旨意。

透过墙上的缝隙，科贝特看到布斯扔掉了拐杖和卡宾枪，举起左轮手枪，向门口跃去。

科贝特认为，布斯会试图杀出一条血路，一边跑一边开枪，为了自由做最后的挣扎。

因此，为了阻止无效的牺牲，科贝特走上前，将手枪架在手臂上，一边为布斯的灵魂祈祷，一边朝着墙缝扣动了扳机。

在枪声中布斯大叫一声，一脚抬在空中，身子向前倾，面朝下倒在干草堆上。他伤得很重。

烈焰顺着干草迅速地蔓延。为了在布斯被烤焦之前将他救出来，贝克中尉冲进了火场，一个箭步扑到布斯身上，从他紧握的拳头中夺下他的手枪。因为怕他装死，贝克中尉反剪了布斯的双手。

很快，布斯被抬到了农舍的门廊处。一位士兵跨上马，沿着土路奔向三英里外的皇家港请医生。

加勒特太太的妹妹霍洛韦小姐寄宿在加勒特家中，在当地学校教书。当她发现那躺在门廊边忍冬藤下的垂死之人便是大众情人约翰·威尔克斯·布斯时，她表示布斯应该得到悉心的照料。她从屋内拖出了一张床垫，让布斯躺在上面。她拿出自己的枕头，垫在布斯头下。接着她将布斯的头枕在自己的膝盖上，试图喂他喝一些葡萄酒。但是布斯的喉咙似乎麻木了，根本无法吞咽。随后她用手帕沾了水，濡湿布斯的嘴唇和舌头，并为他按摩太阳穴和前额。

布斯承受着巨大的痛苦，强撑了两个半小时。他不停地咳嗽，恳求康格上校用力掐住他的脖子。他痛苦地呻吟着：“杀了我！杀了我！”

他恳求给他的母亲捎最后一句话。他断断续续地说道：

“告诉她……我做了……我认为最棒的事……我是为了国家……而死。”

在死前最后一刻，他想举起双手，好让自己看见。可是他们完全不明白他的意思。他咕哝道：

“没用！没用！”

这便是他最后的遗言。

布斯死的时候，太阳刚巧升上加勒特院子中那棵刺槐的树梢。“他的下巴抽搐了几下便向下歪了过去；他的眼珠看向脚尖，瞳孔开始放大……咯噔一声，他双腿一伸，头向后仰去。”一切都结束了。

当时是早上七点钟，比林肯去世当天的时间晚了二十二分钟。波士顿·科贝特的子弹击中了布斯的后脑勺，比他击中林肯的部位低了一英寸。

医生剪下了布斯的一簇头发，将它交给了霍洛韦小姐。霍洛韦小姐一直珍藏着布斯的头发和那只曾垫在布斯头下、沾满了布斯血迹的枕头。直至多年后，迫于贫困的压力，霍洛韦小姐不得不用半个枕套换了一桶面粉。

布斯还没断气时，侦探们便跪在地上搜了他的身。侦探们找到了一管烟斗、一把博伊刀、两支左轮手枪、一本日记、一个黏糊糊的满是蜡烛油的罗盘、一张面值三百美金的加拿大银行汇票、一枚钻石别针、一个指甲锉，以及五位爱慕他的女性照片。其中四人是演员：艾菲·热尔蒙（Effe Germon）、爱丽丝·格雷（Alice Grey）、海伦·韦斯顿（Helen Western）和“漂亮的费伊·布朗（Pretty Fay Brown）”。第五人是一位名流。出于对她子孙的尊重，这里便隐去她的名字。

接着多尔蒂上校扯下一块马鞍褥，问加勒特太太借了针线，将布斯的尸体缝在马鞍褥中，然后给了黑人老头内德·弗里曼（Ned Freeman）两美金，请他将布斯的尸体拖到波托马克河，有船在那里等着。

贝克中尉（La Fayette C．Baker）在《美国特工处历史》一书第五百零五页这样描绘了去往河边的那一段行程：

在马车的颠簸下，布斯本已不流血的伤口再次滴起血来。鲜血从马车的缝隙里往下滴落在车轴上，在路面上留下了一摊摊圆形的痕迹。车板上全是斑驳血迹，马鞍褥也被血浸湿了……一路上，殷红的血不停地从布斯的尸体上缓缓渗出，滴滴答答地流着。

在这过程中，一件意想不到的事发生了。贝克曾说内德·弗里曼的旧马车“一路摇摇晃晃，发出咯吱咯吱的声响，就好像随时会解体一样”。这辆旧马车不仅是“好像随时会解体一样”，在负重奔驰的过程中，它真的在路面上解体了。一枚大螺栓突然断裂，马车从中间断裂开来。前轮脱离了马车滚到一边，车厢前段砰的一声砸在地上。布斯的尸体向前倒去，“就好像用尽力气跳车逃跑一样”。

贝克中尉放弃了这辆散架的旧马车，从附近的农民那儿征用了一辆马车，将布斯的尸体扔进车厢，匆匆赶到了河边，接着将尸体搬上了政府的拖船“约翰·艾德号”。在突突的声响中，拖船载着布斯向华盛顿驶去。

第二天凌晨，布斯被杀的消息已传遍了全城。此时，布斯的尸体正躺在即将在波托马克河抛锚停泊的“蒙托克号”炮艇上。

整个首都都沸腾了，数千人涌到了河边，虎视眈眈地盯着那艘运尸船。

中午的时候，特工处长官贝克上校冲到了斯坦顿面前，向他报告有一群市民公然违反命令登上了“蒙托克号”，其中一位妇女还剪下了布斯的一簇头发。

斯坦顿顿时警觉起来。“布斯的每一根头发，”他大喊道，“都会被反叛者们当作珍贵的纪念品。”

斯坦顿一直认为，暗杀林肯是杰佛逊·戴维斯和其他南方联盟领导人精心策划的一场罪大恶极的阴谋，因此他担心布斯的头发不仅仅是纪念品那么简单。他担心南方联盟得到布斯的尸体后，利用它煽动南方的奴隶主们再次扛起来复枪，掀起新一轮的战争。

斯坦顿下令以最快的速度秘密掩埋布斯的尸体。必须抹除布斯身上的一切痕迹，一件饰物、一片衣服碎片、一根头发也不能留给南方联盟。

斯坦顿发布了命令。当天傍晚，当太阳沉入火烧云后面时，贝克上校和他的侄子贝克中尉踏上一艘小艇，来到“蒙托克号”旁，他们登上炮艇，然后在岸边、在众多目光的注视下做了三件事：

首先，他们将装有布斯尸体的松木枪支箱从“蒙托克号”上降了下来，放在他们来时的小艇上。接着，他们降下了巨大的铁球和沉重的铰链。随后，他们爬上来时的小艇，向着下游驶去。

岸边好奇的人们做了一件两位探员期望他们做的事：人们沿着河岸奔跑，互相推搡着，一时间水花飞溅。人们兴奋地谈论着，坚决要看着那艘殡仪船，看看布斯的尸体到底要沉在何处。

人们跟着漂流而下的探员们跑了两英里。夜色笼罩了河面，云层遮挡了月亮和星辰，再敏锐的眼睛也无法辨认出河中央的小艇。

当两位探员来到波托马克河最偏僻的天鹅港（Geeseborough Point）时，贝克上校确定他们已完全离开了人们的视线。于是他们划着小船驶入前方的沼泽地。那里臭气熏天，满是各种腐烂的沼泽植物，是军队中死马、死驴的埋骨之地。

两位探员在这片可怕的沼泽里等了数个小时，仔细听着周围的动静，以判断是否有人跟踪他们。然而，除了牛蛙的叫声和水波在莎草间荡漾的声音，四周没有任何异常。

午夜时分，四周安静得令人窒息。两位探员极为小心地调转船头逆流而上。一路上，他们不敢说话，摇桨的声音和水花拍打船舷的声音让他们感到惶恐。

最后，他们来到了一所旧监狱的围墙外侧。与水面接壤的那面坚固的石墙上有一个洞，探员们驾着船顺着墙洞进入了监狱。他们向盘查他们的官员递交了连署口令，随后递上了一副盖子上刻着“约翰·威尔克斯·布斯”的棺木。半个小时后，布斯的棺木被埋在了一间大屋的西南角。这间大屋是个兵工厂，原本是用来存放弹药的。棺木入土后，地面被重新抹平，看上去和其他地方一样。

第二天日出时分，兴奋的民众拿着抓钩挤上波托马克河，在天鹅港后面的沼泽里捅开死马、死驴的尸体仔细地搜索着。

全国数百万人都在询问布斯的尸体到底是怎么处理的。只有八个人知道答案——这八个人全都忠心耿耿，发誓绝对不会泄露秘密。

在重重谜团中，谣言四起，各大报纸也堂而皇之地散播着谣言。布斯的头和心脏存放在了华盛顿陆军医学博物馆——《波士顿广告报》这样写道。有的报纸则声称布斯的尸体已被丢入大海，还有媒体称布斯已被火葬。有一家周刊发表了一份所谓“目击者”的简述，称布斯的尸体已在午夜葬入波托马克河底。

在这种互相矛盾的猜测中，又产生了新的谣言：布斯逃走了，被枪杀的另有其人。

新谣言的产生大概是因为布斯死时的样子和他生前的模样很不一样。一八六五年四月二十七日，在斯坦顿授意下，约翰·弗雷德里克·梅（John Frederick May）医生登上了“蒙托克号”炮艇，指认布斯的遗体。梅医生是华盛顿名医，当遗体上的防水油布被揭开时，他是这样说的：

令我感到震惊的是，我面前的这具尸体的相貌和我记忆中的那张脸一点儿也不像。我当时非常惊讶，于是立刻对巴恩斯将军说：“这具尸体一点儿也不像布斯，我也无法相信他就是布斯。”……后来，在我的要求下，尸体被摆成了坐着的姿势，我站着从上往下看，终于勉强认出了布斯的特征。我从没见过哪个人生前和死后会有如此大的变化——一个健康的、充满活力的生命，变成了眼前这具形容憔悴的尸体：皮肤蜡黄且满是污渍，头发蓬乱打结，由于风吹日晒和饥饿的折磨脸颊凹陷。

其他见过布斯尸体的人甚至不能“勉强”认出他来。他们将自己的疑虑说了出来，于是谣言迅速地传播起来。

守护尸体的人守口如瓶，政府迅速又秘密地掩埋了布斯的尸体，再加上斯坦顿拒绝透露任何讯息，也不否认任何谣言，于是谣言越传越荒谬。

首都当地的《宪政公会报》称整场表演都是一个骗局。其他报纸也纷纷发声。“我们都知道，布斯跑了。”《里士满检查者报》如是说。《路易斯维尔报》公开表示整个事件的真相肮脏不堪，还表示“贝克和他的同伙特意策划了这起阴谋来欺骗美国财政部”。

这场论战越来越激烈。和通常情况一样，数百位目击者跳了出来，声称自己在加勒特谷仓枪击事件过后遇到过布斯，还和他说上了话。布斯一会儿在这里，一会儿在那里，到处都有他的影子——有的说他逃到了加拿大，有的说他去了墨西哥，有的说他乘船去了南美，有的说他躲在欧洲，有的说他在弗吉尼亚州讲道，还有的说他去了东方的小岛上。

就这样，布斯之死成了美国历史上最为人所津津乐道的神秘话题。这个话题盛行了约七十五年。直至今日，仍有数千人相信布斯成功逃跑了，其中很多人拥有着非凡的智力。

很多学识渊博的人士都公开表示自己相信这些谣言。国内一位知名神父在全国各地的演讲中，对着成百上千的听众公然宣布，布斯逃走了。就在我写这一章时，还有一位受过科学训练的学者郑重地对我说，布斯当时成功逃脱了。

当然，布斯确实死了，这点是毫无疑问的。那个在加勒特的仓库里被射杀的男人想尽一切理由为自己开脱，但是即便在最后关头，他也没有说自己不是约翰·威尔克斯·布斯。因为在死亡面前，这个理由实在是荒谬得连试都不用试。

为了再次确定被射杀的男人是布斯，在布斯的尸体到达华盛顿后，斯坦顿派了十个人前去辨认尸体。其中一个就是上面提到的梅医生。他曾在布斯的脖子上“切下了一个巨大的纤维瘤”，刀口愈合后留下了一条“巨大而丑陋的伤疤”。梅医生就是靠这道伤疤辨认出了布斯。他是这样说的：

从抓捕人员带回来的尸体看，遗体的脸上没有哪一处和活着的布斯是相似的。但是手术刀留下的痕迹是抹不掉的。这道疤痕解决了当下所有的以及未来有可能出现的疑虑，证明了眼前的男人便是谋杀总统的凶手。

梅里尔牙医根据他不久前塞在布斯牙齿里的填充物认出了布斯。

布斯曾投宿过的酒店的职员查尔斯·道森（Charles Dawson）根据布斯右手上名字首字母“J．W．B．”字样的文身认出了布斯。

华盛顿著名摄影师加德纳也认出了布斯，还有布斯的密友亨利·克莱·福特（Henry Clay Ford）。

一八六九年二月十五日，当安德鲁·约翰逊（Andrew Johnson）总统下令挖出布斯的尸体时，布斯的朋友们再一次确认了布斯的身份。

接着布斯的遗体被运往巴尔的摩，重新埋在绿山公墓，与布斯家族合葬。在下葬前，布斯的哥哥和母亲以及布斯的至交好友再次确认了尸体是布斯本人。

不知道除了布斯外，是否还有人在死后被辨认了那么多次。

即便如此，谣言仍在继续传播。在八十年代，很多人都认为弗吉尼亚州里士满的阿姆斯特朗牧师便是伪装后的布斯，因为阿姆斯特朗有一双煤黑色的眼睛，跛足，行事风格很戏剧化，留着一头乌黑的长发，正好可以遮住脖子上的伤疤——人们如是说。

各地还出现了其他版本的“布斯”，数量不少于二十个。

一八七二年，一位“约翰·威尔克斯·布斯”在田纳西大学的学生面前念了几段戏剧台词，表演了几个敏捷的手法。这位布斯娶了一位寡妇，后来又厌倦了对方。他告诉那位寡妇，自己才是暗杀林肯的凶手，还说自己要去新奥尔良，因为那里有一笔钱在等着他。接着他便消失了。自那以后“布斯夫人”再也没有得到他的消息。

七十年代末，得克萨斯州格兰伯里市有一位患有哮喘的总是醉醺醺的酒馆老板，向一位名叫贝茨的年轻律师承认自己才是真正的布斯。他露出脖子上难看的伤疤，有模有样地说约翰逊副总统命他杀死林肯，还向他承诺如果被抓到会宽大处理。

二十五年后，也就是一九〇三年一月十三日，一位喝醉了酒的瘾君子，油漆工大卫·乔治（David E．George）在俄克拉荷马州伊尼德市的大道酒店服用士的宁自杀了。在自杀前，他“承认”自己就是约翰·威尔克斯·布斯。他说暗杀了林肯后，他的朋友们将他藏在行李箱中，带着他坐上了前往欧洲的轮船，还说他在欧洲待了十年。

那位名叫贝茨的律师在报上读到了这条消息后，立刻冲到了俄克拉荷马州。查看了尸体后，贝茨发现，这位大卫·乔治正是二十五年前向他坦言自己就是布斯的得克萨斯州格兰伯里市的那位患有哮喘的总是醉醺醺的酒馆老板。

贝茨让殡仪馆的工作人员将尸体的头发梳成布斯生前的发型，他趴在尸体上大声痛哭，然后给尸体涂上了防腐剂。他将尸体带回自己在田纳西州孟菲斯市的家中，存放在马厩长达二十年之久。在此期间，他曾试图用这具尸体冒领美国政府当初为了抓捕布斯而承诺的巨额奖金。

一九〇八年，贝茨写了一本荒谬的书，名为《逃亡后自杀的约翰·威尔克斯·布斯——刺杀林肯的凶手多年后真正的自白》。这本名噪一时的作品卖了七万册，引起了不小的轰动。他曾向亨利·福特（Henry Ford）索价一千美金出售他的“木乃伊布斯”。最后，他带着这具干尸在南方巡回展览，一张票十美分。

现在，在各种嘉年华中共有五个不同的头骨被当作布斯的头骨进行展出。

离开白宫后，林肯夫人陷入了严重的困境，声名扫地，成了公众的谈资。

在家庭日常开销上，林肯夫人十分吝啬。按照长久以来的传统，总统一家每个季度都要举办一定次数的国宴。但是林肯夫人却强烈要求林肯打破传统，因为这些宴会“十分昂贵”，还说现在是战时，公众招待会应该“节俭一些”。

有一次林肯不得不提醒她：“除了节俭，我们还应该考虑其他事情。”

然而，一旦涉及那些能够满足她虚荣心的东西，例如裙子和珠宝，她不但忘记了节俭，而且会丧失理智般沉浸在花钱的狂欢中。

一八六一年，她从大草原来到华盛顿，她自信地以为，作为“林肯夫人”，她一定能成为名流荟萃的华盛顿社交圈的中心。然而，她惊讶又屈辱地发现，自己受到了这个南方城市中傲慢贵族的漠视和排斥。在南方贵族眼中，她是一个对南方不友好的肯塔基人，因为她嫁了一个粗鄙笨拙的、将战争强加在他们身上的“黑人爱好者”。

此外，她的性格也没有任何讨喜之处。必须承认的是，她是一个吝啬、普通、充满嫉妒心、情绪很容易受到影响、毫无教养的泼妇。

她自己无法受到追捧，因此十分嫉恨那些受欢迎的名媛。当时华盛顿社交圈的女王是著名的美人阿黛尔·卡茨·道格拉斯（Adèle Cutts Douglas），也是林肯夫人昔日的恋人史蒂芬·道格拉斯的夫人。道格拉斯夫人和萨蒙·蔡斯的女儿那无与伦比的受欢迎程度激起了林肯夫人的妒忌心，因此她决定用钱来给自己带来名望——为自己买昂贵的衣服和首饰。

“为了撑场面，”她对伊丽莎白·凯克利说，“我必须要有钱。林肯先生给我的那些钱根本不够用。他为人太诚实了，除了薪水，一分钱也不会贪。结果是，我不得不负债累累。”

林肯夫人的债务高达七万美金。这是一个庞大的数字，因为林肯作为总统一年的薪水是两万五千美金。他必须不吃不喝两年零九个月才能买得起她的那些奢侈品。

我好几次都引用了伊丽莎白·凯克利的话。她是一位非常聪明的黑人女性。获得自由后，她来到了华盛顿，开了一家裁缝店。没过多久，她就得到了华盛顿名流的赞誉。

一八六一至一八六五年间，她几乎每天都在白宫为林肯夫人做衣服，并像贴身女仆一样伺候她的起居。最后，她不仅成了林肯夫人的知己和顾问，更成了林肯夫人最亲密的伙伴。林肯中枪那晚，林肯夫人唯一呼喊的人便是伊丽莎白·凯克利。

值得庆幸的是，凯克利夫人将自己的经历写成了一本书。这本书已绝版了半个世纪，但是偶尔也能从善本商手中花费十或二十美金买到一两本残破的复本。这本书的名字很长：《幕后——昔日的奴隶，今日的服装店女老板，林肯夫人的密友伊丽莎白·凯克利为您讲述她的三十年奴隶生涯和四年白宫生涯》。

伊丽莎白·凯克利写道，一八六四年夏天，当林肯为连任而忙碌的时候，“林肯夫人因恐惧和焦虑而陷入了疯狂。”

为什么呢？林肯夫人的一位纽约债主威胁说要起诉她。若让林肯的政敌听到她负债累累的风声，他们一定会借此在激烈的竞选过程中搅起腥风血雨。一想到这一点，林肯夫人便焦虑得寝食难安。

“如果他能连任，那我就能瞒住他。可是如果他失败了，他们就会寄账单来，他马上就会知道这一切。”她歇斯底里地哭着说道。

“我会跪下为你祈祷，”她哭着对林肯说，“希望你能得到更多的选票。”

“玛丽，”林肯责备道，“我担心你会因为过分焦虑而倒下。如果我能连任，那固然很好，但如果不能，你也要承受得住失落。”

“林肯先生有没有怀疑你在外面欠了钱？”凯克利夫人问道。

根据《幕后》第一百五十页上的内容，林肯夫人是这样回答的：

“上帝啊，不行！”——这是林肯夫人最喜欢说的一句话——“我不会让他怀疑的。如果他知道自己的妻子欠了那么多债，他会发疯的。”

“林肯遭遇暗杀这件事唯一令人感到欣慰的是，”凯克利夫人写道，“他至死也不知道这笔债务。”

林肯下葬后还不到一个星期，林肯夫人便将林肯那些绣着他名字首字母的衬衫拿到了宾夕法尼亚大街上的一间店铺里，打算卖掉它们换钱。

苏华德听说后怀着沉重的心情跑去那家商店，买走了林肯所有的遗物。




林肯夫人离开白宫的时候，随身带走了二十个行李箱和五十个包裹。

这引起了极大的非议。

她早就因为伪造招待拿破仑亲王的费用账单骗取国库钱财而受到了公开又持续的谴责。同时她的敌人们也指出，当初她来到白宫时只带了几个行李箱，现在却带着一车的东西离开……这些东西是从哪里来的？她有没有趁乱洗劫白宫？她是否拿走了所有能拿的东西？

即便到了一八六七年十月六日——她离开华盛顿两年半后——《克利夫兰先驱报》在提到林肯夫人时是这样说的：

“要让全国人民知道，白宫被掠走的东西价值十万美金。要证明给民众看，这一掠夺行动到底便宜了谁？”

诚然，在“绯色皇后”掌权期间，白宫确实丢失了很多东西，但也很难说是林肯夫人的错。当然，她犯了错误：一到白宫后，她做的第一件事便是辞退了管家和一些员工，声称出于节约考虑，她表示自己可以管好这个地方。

于是她接管了白宫的内务。除了门把手和厨房的炉子，仆人们几乎把白宫偷空了。一八六一年三月九日，《华盛顿之星》报道说，很多第一次参加白宫招待会的客人都说他们的外套和宽罩衫不见了。没过多久，甚至连白宫的家具也被运了出去。

五十个包裹和二十个行李箱！里面都装了些什么？大多数都是垃圾：没用的礼品、雕像、不值钱的画和书、蜡花环、鹿头，还有一大堆已经完全过时的衣物——那些她在春田市时穿的衣服。

“她对囤积旧物，”凯克利夫人说，“有着一种别样的热情。”

当林肯夫人收拾行李的时候，她那刚从哈佛毕业的儿子罗伯特建议她烧了那些中看不中用的垃圾。她对此嗤之以鼻。罗伯特说：

“我真希望载着这些包裹的马车在去芝加哥的路上着火，然后烧光你的这些战利品。”

林肯夫人离开白宫那天早晨，“没有一个朋友来为她送行。”凯克利夫人写道，“当时的情景冷清得令人难受。”

即便是新上任的总统安德鲁·约翰逊也没有来和她告别。事实上，林肯暗杀事件过后，他甚至连一句安慰的话都没有写给她。他知道林肯夫人讨厌自己，因此也用行动回应了她。

虽然现在看来很荒唐，但在当时，林肯夫人深信安德鲁·约翰逊是林肯暗杀事件背后的主使。

林肯的遗孀带着她的两个儿子泰德和罗伯特去往芝加哥。他们在蒙特饭店逗留了一个星期，发现花销太贵了，于是搬到了海德公园避暑山庄内“狭小、陈设简单”的房间里。

因为承担不起优越生活的花销，她黯然落泪。她和以前的亲戚朋友断绝了联系，安顿下来教泰德读书写字。

泰德是林肯最宠爱的儿子。他的真名叫托马斯，但是林肯总是叫他“泰德”或者“小蝌蚪”，因为他出生时脑袋大得出奇。

泰德通常都和爸爸一起睡。有的时候他躺在白宫的办公室里，躺着躺着便睡着了，然后总统就会将他扛在肩上放到床上去。泰德有一点儿口吃，于是林肯总喜欢逗他。泰德很聪明，他以自己的口吃为托词拒绝了各种受教育的机会。因此他现在已经十二岁了，但仍旧不识字。

凯克利夫人写道，泰德第一次上拼写课的时候，花了十分钟争辩猿应该写成猴子。他曾在一块木版画上见过这个词，他一直认为那块木板上画的是猴子。最后，三个人费了好大劲才说服了他。

林肯夫人想尽一切办法说服国会向她支付十万美金，理由是若林肯活着结束连任，他就能拿到那么多薪水。国会拒绝了她的请求，于是她刻薄地咒骂那些阻碍她计划的“朋友”是“声名狼藉、无恶不作的骗子”。

“这些头发花白的罪人死的时候，”她说，“邪恶之父会把他们带向地狱。”

最后，国会给了她两万两千美金——相当于林肯工作到当年年底的薪水。她用这笔钱在芝加哥买了一栋前院铺着大理石的房子。

两年过去了，但是林肯的遗产还没有处理妥当。在这期间，她的花销不断增加，她的债主也非常生气。现在，她不得不接受房客，然后是寄宿的人。最后她不得不放弃了自己的房子，搬去了寄宿式旅馆。

她的钱眼看就要用完了，到了一八六七年九月，用她自己的话说，她已经“为了寻求生活物资而处于一种十分窘迫的境地”。

于是，她打包了自己的旧衣物、饰物和珠宝，戴上厚重的面纱，赶到纽约，化名“克拉克夫人”。她与凯克利夫人碰了面，抱着一包旧裙子，雇了辆马车，驶向第七大道上的一家二手衣物店。但是店主的出价低得令人十分失望。

接着她又来到了百老汇大街609号的布雷迪-凯斯公司。这是一家钻石代理公司。听了林肯夫人令人震惊的故事后，他们说：

“听着，把你的东西给我们，我们会在几个星期内给你弄十万美金。”

这听起来很不错，于是她按照他们的要求，写了两三页纸，痛诉自己贫困交加的境况。

凯斯将这几张纸拿到了共和党领导人面前，威胁他们说如果不给他现金，就将它们发表。

但是共和党的领导人只是评价了林肯夫人几句，其他什么也没做。

接着林肯夫人要求布雷迪-凯斯公司替她向外界发送十五万份传单，向全社会的慷慨人士求助，但是没有哪位重要人物愿意为林肯夫人签名。

林肯夫人对共和党怒火中烧，于是转而向林肯的敌人求助。纽约的《世界报》是一家民主党报纸，曾一度被政府下令停刊。它的主编也因猛烈抨击林肯而遭到了逮捕。林肯夫人在《世界报》上诉说着自己的贫困，坦言自己打算卖掉旧衣物，以及像“一个阳伞套和两套裙装底样”这类琐碎的东西。

当时正是大选前夕，于是民主党的《世界报》刊登了林肯夫人的信，强烈谴责共和党的瑟洛·威德、威廉·苏华德以及《纽约时报》的亨利·雷蒙德（Henry J．Raymond）。

为了挖苦共和党，《世界报》庄重地邀请民主党读者为共和党第一任总统那被遗弃的、生活窘迫的遗孀捐款。然而，捐款的数额很少。

接着，林肯夫人又打算发动黑人为自己筹钱。她敦促凯克利夫人全身心地投入这件事中，并承诺若能从黑人那儿筹集两万五千美金，那么凯克利夫人就能在林肯夫人有生之年每年得到三百美金的好处费，并在林肯夫人去世后能拿到全部的捐款。

接着布雷迪-凯斯公司刊登了广告，要在店内售卖林肯夫人的旧衣物和珠宝。人们闻讯而来，拿着裙子评头论足，说这些裙子早就过时了，说这些衣服标价太高，还说这些衣服“十分破旧，腋下和裙底都磨损了，内里还有污渍”。

布雷迪-凯斯公司还在店铺内设置了一个认捐簿，希望来访的客人即便不愿意买下那些衣物，也能为林肯夫人捐一点儿钱。

最后，两位商人失望地将她的衣服和珠宝带到了罗得岛州的普罗维登斯，打算在那里举办一场收费展览，每张票二十五美分。但是普罗维登斯市当局根本听都不想听这件事。

林肯夫人的衣物最终卖了八百二十四美金，但是布雷迪-凯斯公司却收取了八百二十美金的服务费。

林肯夫人的筹钱运动不仅失败了，而且还引起了公众强烈的谴责。在整个过程中，她不顾廉耻地展出自己，公众也毫不犹豫地展露了他们无情的一面。

“她不仅侮辱了她自己，侮辱了她的国家，还侮辱了她死去的丈夫。”《奥尔巴尼日报》这样写道。

她是个骗子，还是一个小偷——瑟洛·威德在给《商业广告杂志》的信中这样谴责她道。

多年来，在伊利诺伊州，林肯夫人一直是“春田市的噩梦”，“她那古怪的脾气是人们津津乐道的话题”，“林肯先生在家中的忍耐力堪比第二个苏格拉底”——《哈特福特晚间新闻报》如是说。但是《春田市日报》主编却写道，多年来大家都知道林肯夫人精神不大正常，因此对于她那些奇怪的举动，我们应该报以同情。

“林肯夫人那个可怕的女人，”春田市的《共和党报》抱怨道，“坚持要将自己那令人讨厌的一面呈现在世人面前，从而成为全国的笑柄。”

面对这些辱骂，林肯夫人将自己破碎的心在信中展现给了凯克利夫人：

罗伯特昨晚回来时好像疯了一样，面如死灰，似乎没命了一般。因为昨天《世界报》把那些信登了出来……我一边哭一边给你写信。我祈祷明天早晨让我死掉算了。但是我放不下我的小泰德。

在与姐妹和其他亲属疏远了之后，她最终和罗伯特也决裂了。她公然地挖苦、诽谤自己的儿子，以至于她的信件必须将写罗伯特的段落删减后才能发表。

林肯夫人四十九岁时给她的黑人裁缝写信说道：“我觉得在这个世上，除了你，我再也没有朋友了。”

在美国历史上，没有哪位总统像林肯那样受到了如此崇高的尊敬和爱戴，同时，大概也没有哪位总统夫人像林肯夫人那样，受到了如此强烈的谴责和唾弃。

林肯夫人想方设法变卖二手衣物后一个月，林肯的遗产处理好了。林肯的遗产共约十一万零两百九十五美金，被林肯夫人和她的两个儿子平分了，每人三万六千七百六十五美金。

林肯夫人将泰德送出国后独自隐居，读法国小说，不和任何美国人接触。

没过多久，她又开始哭穷了。她向美国参议院请愿，要求每年向她支付五千美金的抚恤金。这个要求招来了参议院上上下下里里外外的嘘声和鄙视。

“这是无耻的敲诈！”爱荷华州的参议员豪厄尔这样说道。

“她和她的丈夫根本不是一路人。”伊利诺伊州的参议员耶茨说，“她同情叛军，根本不值得我们捐助。”

经过数月的耽搁和谴责，她最终得到了每年三千美金的退休金。

一八七一年夏天，泰德在极度的痛苦中死于伤寒。同时，林肯夫人剩下的唯一的儿子罗伯特也结了婚。

孤独，没有朋友，绝望。就这样，林肯夫人成了强迫症的猎物。有一天，在佛罗里达州的杰克逊维尔，她买了一杯咖啡，但拒绝喝掉，因为她坚持认为里面下了毒。

她登上回芝加哥的火车时给家庭医生发了电报，恳求他挽救罗伯特的生命。但是罗伯特并没有生病。罗伯特在车站接到了她，陪她在太平洋大酒店住了一个星期，一直试图安抚她。

半夜的时候，她总是冲到罗伯特的房间，声称有恶魔要谋害她，她说印第安人“从她脑子里拔出了金属丝”，还说医生“从她脑子里拿出了钢发条”。

白天的时候，她便四处逛街，买一些匪夷所思的东西。例如，她花三百美金买了一套奢华的蕾丝窗帘，可她连挂的地方都没有。

罗伯特·林肯带着沉重的心情向芝加哥地方法院申请判定他母亲的精神状况。由十二人组成的陪审团最终判定她患有精神疾病，接着她便被送往了伊利诺伊州巴达维亚的一家私立精神病院。

十三个月后，她被放了出来，但并未痊愈。于是这个生病的可怜女人去了国外，和陌生人住在一起，甚至拒绝给罗伯特写信，不让他知道自己的地址。

她在法国波城独居的时候，有一天她爬上梯子，想在壁炉上方挂一幅画。结果梯子坏了，她摔了下来，摔伤了脊髓，因此很长一段时间她都无法走路。

林肯夫人回到了故土，在春田市自己姐姐爱德华夫人家中度过了人生最后的时光。弥留之际她不断地说：“你现在应该祈祷，保佑我很快就能见到我的丈夫和儿子们。”

尽管当时她有六千美金现金以及七万五千美金政府债券，但她仍然荒谬地害怕贫穷，同时也总是担心当时的战争部长罗伯特会像他的父亲那样遭遇暗杀。

她不愿面对艰难的现实，于是将自己关在房间里，什么人都不见。她锁上门，关上窗，拉上窗帘，不让阳光照进房间，然后在房间里点上一支蜡烛，即便当时外面正艳阳高照。

“无论怎么劝，”她的私人医生说，“她都不肯出来呼吸一下新鲜空气。”

在那孤单而昏黄的烛光下，她的记忆越过那些残酷的岁月，回到了还是少女时的韶华岁月。她想着自己再一次和斯蒂芬·道格拉斯共舞华尔兹，沉醉在他那亲切的举止和浑厚动听的嗓音中。

偶尔她也会想起自己的另一位心上人，那位名叫林肯——亚伯拉罕·林肯的小伙子在那天晚上向她示爱。确实，他既没钱，长得也不好看，只是一个住在斯皮德杂货铺楼上的小律师，但是她相信，在自己的鞭策下，这个小伙子一定能成为总统。于是她努力取悦他，最后赢得了他的婚姻。虽然十五年来她只穿黑色的衣服，但是她会在特定的时候前往春田市的商店。据她的医生回忆，她买了“一大堆丝绸衣物和成箱的裙子，每次都是满满一马车。但她从来都不穿，只是堆在那里，真担心储藏室的地板承受不住塌掉”。

一八八二年，在一个平静的夏夜，这个疲惫而暴虐的可怜灵魂终于得到了解脱。这是她期盼已久的事情。因中风而全身瘫痪后，她在姐姐家中平静地离世了。四十年前，就是在这里，亚伯拉罕·林肯为她戴上了那枚刻着“爱是永恒”的戒指。

一八七六年，一个制造假币的团伙企图偷走林肯的遗体。这是一个十分惊人的故事，在写林肯的诸多书籍中，很少有书提到这件事。

基尼利绰号“大吉姆”，他的帮派是一个非常聪明的假币制造团伙，长期以来一直让美国特工处倍感头痛。在七十年代，“大吉姆帮”总部设在伊利诺伊州的田园小城林肯市。

“大吉姆”称自己的手下为儒雅的“推销员”。数年来，他们遍布全国，并成功地将伪造的五元纸币推销到了全国各地的柜台之上。“大吉姆帮”获得了暴利。但是到了一八七六年春天，“大吉姆帮”却遭遇了致命危机，因为帮派的假币刻版大师本·博伊德被捕入狱，假币的供应几乎处于枯竭状态。

数月来，“大吉姆”一直在圣路易斯和芝加哥寻找新的刻版师，却一无所获。最后，他决定还是要想办法把本·博伊德弄出来。

“大吉姆”产生了一个十分卑劣的想法：偷走林肯的遗体并把它藏起来，接着，待北方闹得沸沸扬扬时，“大吉姆”再强势地提出自己的诉求——只要释放博伊德，再奉上一大堆金子，就归还林肯神圣的遗体。

这么做危险吗？一点儿也不危险，因为伊利诺伊州的法令全书上根本没有对盗窃尸体定罪。

于是，一八七六年六月，“大吉姆”扫除了障碍，开始着手行动。“大吉姆”派了五名手下前往春田市，在那儿开了一家带舞池的酒馆，借着酒保的身份筹备盗窃林肯遗体的计划。

可是不幸的是，他的一名“酒保”在六月的一个星期六晚上喝多了，摇摇晃晃来到了春田市的一家妓院，然后不小心说出了他们的计划。那名“酒保”吹嘘自己很快就会得到一桶黄金。

那名“酒保”小声地说出了计划的细节：七月三日晚上，为了庆祝第二天的独立日，春田市会发射火箭式烟火，到时他就溜到橡树岭公墓，“偷走老林肯的骨头”——这是他的原话——等到半夜时分，将遗骨藏在桑加蒙河桥下方的沙堤之中。

一个小时后，得知这一消息的妓女匆匆赶往警局，将这骇人听闻的消息告诉了警察。天亮时，她已经和好几个人说了这件事，于是整个春田市都知道了。那些假酒保不得不扔下手中的抹布，逃离了春田市。

但是，“大吉姆”并未被打败，他只是延迟了计划而已。他将帮派的总部从春田市迁至芝加哥的麦迪逊西大街294号。他在那儿有一间酒馆。在前厅的时候，他是给客人们斟酒的特伦斯·马伦（Terrence Mullen），但是在后院，他有一个套间，是团伙秘密会面的地点。酒馆的吧台旁立着一座林肯的半身像。

一连几个月，一个名叫路易斯·斯维格尔斯（Lewis G．Swegles）的小偷一直光顾酒馆，和“大吉姆”的帮派混得很熟。他承认自己已经因为盗马而“二进宫”了，还吹嘘说自己现在是“芝加哥盗墓人的老大”。他声称，市里医学院里的尸体大多是他提供的。这话听起来有几分可信度，当时全国都十分抵触盗尸，因此医学院只能被迫从盗墓人手里购买教学用的尸体。这些盗墓人总是在深夜两点钟的时候背着鼓胀的麻袋，将帽檐压得极低地出现在医学院的后门口。

斯维格尔斯和“大吉姆”的帮派一起完善了盗窃林肯墓的计划。他们打算先将林肯的遗体装入一个大麻袋，将麻袋扔进轻便马车，接着沿途不断更换新的马匹，用最快的速度赶到北方的印第安纳州。到了那儿之后，除了水鸟，没人能知道他们的行踪。随后他们将遗体藏在偏僻的沙丘里，届时湖面吹来的风会抹平所有沙丘被移动过的痕迹。

离开芝加哥前，斯维格尔斯买了一份伦敦报纸，撕下一角，将剩下的部分塞到了麦迪逊西大街294号内林肯半身像里面。到了十一月六日那天晚上，他和“大吉姆”的两名手下跳上了芝加哥至奥尔顿的列车。他们拿着那片报纸碎片，向春田市进发。他们打算偷完遗体后在空棺木旁留下这张纸片，到时探员肯定会将它作为证据保存下来。等到全国都闹得沸沸扬扬时，再安排帮派的发言人和州长交涉，要求用价值二十万美金的黄金以及本·博伊德的自由交换林肯的遗体。

州长怎么能确定这名自封的发言人不是骗子呢？到时就拿出那份伦敦报纸，侦探拿空棺木旁的纸片一比对就能知道他们是真的盗墓贼。

一行人按照计划到达了春田市。他们选择在斯维格尔斯称为“天赐良机”的那一天动手。十一月七日正好是大选的日子，数月来，民主党一直因为格兰特第二任任期内政府出现的贪污和腐败而对民主党大加诋毁，而共和党则在民主党面前挥舞着内战的“血衣”。这是美国历史上一场惊心动魄的角逐。那一晚，当激动的人群挤满了大小酒馆，在报社门口漫无目的地转悠时，“大吉姆”的手下趁乱来到了橡树岭公墓，锯断了林肯墓园铁门上的挂锁，走了进去。他们撬开大理石石棺的盖子，将木制的棺材抬起一半。

斯维格尔斯负责准备马匹和轻便马车，然后将它们藏在纪念堂东北面两百码的山坳里。“大吉姆”的一个手下让斯维格尔斯将马车取来，于是斯维格尔斯顺着陡峭的山路向下走去，消失在了夜色中。

斯维格尔斯并不是盗墓贼。他是一个改过自新的犯人，现在为特工处做内线。山坳里根本没有帮手，也没有马车，倒是墓园的纪念堂里有八名探员在等着他。于是他绕了一圈又跑了回去，给了他们一个之前约定好的信号：他划了根火柴，点燃了雪茄，然后小声地说出了密语——“洗澡”。

八名只穿了袜子没穿鞋子的探员冲出了藏身之地，每人手里都拿着一把左轮手枪，随时准备开枪。他们和斯维格尔斯一起冲到了纪念堂处，走进黑暗的陵墓，命令盗墓贼立刻投降。

四周一片寂静。特工处区域长官蒂勒尔点燃了一根火柴，只见棺材还在，一半抬到了石棺外面。但是盗墓贼们在哪里？探员们在墓园里四下搜索起来。月亮升上了树梢。蒂勒尔冲上纪念堂的台阶时，看到两个人影躲在一群雕像后面看着他。带着兴奋和疑惑，蒂勒尔双手持枪向两人开了枪，那两人立刻开枪回击。但他们并不是盗墓贼。蒂勒尔打到了自己人。

与此同时，真正的盗墓贼躲在一百码外的黑暗处，正等着斯维格尔斯带着马车回来。听到枪声后，盗墓贼迅速冲进了树林。

十天后，他们在芝加哥被捕，随后被押往春田市，由重兵日夜看守。一段时间内，民众对这件事十分愤慨。林肯的儿子罗伯特娶了富有的帕尔曼家族的千金，他重金聘请了芝加哥最厉害的律师起诉“大吉姆”的帮派。他们费尽了心思，结果却并不理想。伊利诺伊州的法律并没有针对盗尸提出相应惩罚。如果这伙盗墓贼真的偷了棺木，那还可以借此提起诉讼。但是他们没有，林肯的棺材并没有被带离石棺。于是，芝加哥最贵最好的律师只能以试图盗窃价值七十五美金的棺木为名，起诉那些盗墓贼。这项罪名最多可判五年有期徒刑。但是，这个案子拖了八个月都未能进行庭审。这时，民众的激情已经退去，政治因素开始起作用。在第一次投票时，竟然有四位陪审员投了无罪释放票。经过了几次投票后，十二位陪审员达成了一致，将这群盗墓贼送去乔利埃特监狱服刑一年。

林肯的朋友们担心再有其他人企图盗窃林肯的遗体，因此林肯纪念堂协会将林肯的遗体放在一口铁棺材里，松松地在棺材上盖上木板，然后将棺材安置在类似地窖的地下墓穴后面那潮湿黑暗的通道里。在那两年期间，前来哀悼的人们只能对着一口空石棺寄托哀思。

出于各种各样的原因，林肯的遗体被移动了十七次。但是现在，谁也无法再移动他的骸骨了。一九〇一年九月二十六日，人们将林肯的棺木嵌在一个巨大的钢筋混凝土圆球里面，然后安放在墓园地下六英尺处。

那一天，棺木被打开了，人们最后一次看到了林肯的遗容。据那些见到了林肯的人回忆，林肯看上去非常自然。当时距他去世已过了三十六年，但是在防腐剂良好的保护下，林肯看上去和生前没什么不同，只是脸色更暗了些，以及黑色领带的一角有一小块霉斑。

HOW THIS BOOK WAS WRITTEN—AND WHY


One spring day, some years ago, I was breakfasting in the Hotel Dysart, London; and, as usual, I was trying to winnow a bit of American news from the columns of the “Morning Post.” Ordinarily I found none, but on that fortunate morning I made a strike rich and unexpected.

The late T. P. O'Connor, reputed “Father of the House of Commons,” conducted in those days a column in the “Morning Post” entitled “Men and Memories.” On that particular morning, and for several mornings following, “Tay Pay's” column was devoted to Abraham Lincoln—not to his political activities but to the personal side of his career: to his sorrows, his repeated failures, his poverty, his great love for Ann Rutledge, and his tragic marriage to MaryTodd.

I read the series with profound interest—and surprise. I had spent the first twenty years of my life in the MiddleWest, not far from the Lincoln country; and, in addition to that, I had always been keenly interested in United States history. I should have said that of course I knew Lincoln's life-story; but I soon discovered that I didn't. The fact is that I, an American, had had to come to London and read a series of articles written by an Irishman, in an English newspaper, before I realized that the story of Lincoln's career was one of the most fascinating tales in all the annals of mankind.

Was this lamentable ignorance peculiar to me? I wondered. But I didn't wonder long, for I soon discussed the subject with a number of my fellow-countrymen, and I discovered that they were in the same boat, that about all they knew about Lincoln was this: that he had been born in a log cabin, had walked miles to borrow books and then read them at night, stretched out on the floor in front of the fireplace; that he split rails, became a lawyer, told funny stories, said that a man's legs ought to be long enough to reach the ground, was called “Honest Abe,” debated with Judge Douglas, was elected President of the United States, wore a silk hat, freed the slaves, spoke at Gettysburg, declared that he wished he knew what brand of whisky Grant drank so he could send a barrel of it to his other generals, and was shot by Booth in a theater inWashington.

Aroused by these articles in the “Morning Post,” I went over to the British Museum library and read a number of Lincoln books; and the more I read, the more fascinated I became. Finally I caught on fire and I determined to write a book about Lincoln, myself. I knew that I had not the urge, temperament, training, or ability necessary to produce a learned treatise for the benefit of scholars and historians. Besides, I felt there was little need for another book of that kind, for many excellent ones are already in existence. However, after reading many Lincoln volumes, I did feel that there was a genuine need for a short biography that would tell the most interesting facts about his career briefly and tersely for the average busy and hurried citizen of to-day. I have tried to write such a book.

I began the work in Europe, and labored over it for a year there and then for two years in New York. Finally I tore up all that I had written and tossed it into the wastebasket. I then went out to Illinois, to write of Lincoln on the very ground where he himself had dreamed and toiled. For months I lived among people whose fathers had helped Lincoln survey land and build fences and drive hogs to market. For months I delved among old books and letters and speeches and half-forgotten newspapers and musty court records, trying to understand Lincoln.

I spent one summer in the little town of Petersburg. I went there because it is only a mile away from the restored village of New Salem, where Lincolnspent the happiest and most formative years of his life. There he ran a mill and a grocery store, studied law, worked as a blacksmith, refereed cock-fights and horse-races, fell in love, and had his heart broken.

Even in the heydey of its glory New Salem never had more than a hundred inhabitants, and its entire existence covered a span of about ten years. Shortly after Lincoln left the village it was abandoned; bats and swallows nested in the decaying cabins, and for more than half a century cows grazed over the spot.

A few years ago, however, the State of Illinois secured the site, made it a public park, and built replicas of the log cabins that had stood there a hundred years before. So to-day the deserted village of New Salem looks much as it did in Lincoln's time.

The same white oaks under which Lincoln studied and wrestled and made love are still standing. Every morning I used to take my typewriter and motor up there from Petersburg, and half of the chapters of this book were written under those trees. What a lovely spot in which to work! In front of me flowed the winding Sangamon, and all about me the woods and the hay-fields were musical with the call of the bob-white; and through the trees flashed the color of the blue jay, the yellowhammer, and the redbird. I felt Lincoln there.

I often used to go there alone on summer nights when the whip-poor-wills were crying in the woods along the banks of the Sangamon, when the moonlight outlined Rutledge's tavern against the sky; and it stirred me to realize that on just such nights, about a hundred years ago, young Abe Lincoln and Ann Rutledge had walked over this same ground arm in arm in the moonlight, listening to the night-birds and dreaming ecstatic dreams that were destined never to come true. Yet I am convinced that Lincoln found here at New Salem the only supreme happiness that he ever knew.

When I came to write the chapter dealing with the death of Lincoln's sweetheart, I put a little folding table and a typewriter in a car and drove out over country roads and through a hog lot and a cow pasture until I reached the quiet, secluded spot where Ann Rutledge lies buried. It is utterly abandoned now, and overgrown. To get near her grave, it was necessary to mow down the weeds and brush and vines. And there, where Lincoln came to weep, was set down the story of his grief.

Many of the chapters were written in Springfield. Some in the sitting-room of the old home where Lincoln lived for sixteen unhappy years, some at the desk where he composed his first inaugural address, and others above the spot where he came to court and quarrel with MaryTodd.





PART ONE


1


There was a woman in Harrodsburg—it was called Fort Harrod in those days—named Ann McGinty. The old histories record that Ann and her husband brought the frst hogs into Kentucky, the frst ducks and the frst spinning-wheel; and they also declare that she was the frst woman ever to make butter out there in the dark and bloody wilderness. But her real claim to fame rests upon the fact that she performed an economic and textile miracle. Cotton could be neither grown nor purchased there in the mysterious Indian country, and timber-wolves slaughtered the sheep. So it was well-nigh impossible to fnd any substance from which clothes could be made. Then the ingenious Ann McGinty found a way of spinning thread and making “McGinty cloth” from two substances that were both plentiful and cheap—nettle lint and buffalo wool.

It was a tremendous discovery, and housewives traveled as far as a hundred and ffty miles to sit in her cabin and learn the new art. And as they spun and wove they talked. And they didn't always talk about nettle lint and buffalo wool. Frequently the conversation degenerated into gossip, and Ann McGinty's cabin soon became the community's acknowledged clearinghouse for scandal.

In those days fornication was an indictable offense, and bastardywas a misdemeanor. And evidently there were few other activities in life that gave Ann's shriveled soul more deep and abiding satisfaction than uncovering the story of some suffering girl's error, and then running to the Grand Jury with the news. The records of the Court of Quarter Sessions in Fort Harrod repeatedly tell the pathetic story of some unfortunate girl indicted for fornication “on information of Ann McGinty.” Seventeen cases were tried at Harrodsburg in the spring of 1783, and eight were for fornication.

Among these indictments, there is one brought by the Grand Jury on November 24, 1789, and reading as follows:

“Lucy Hanks for fornication.”

This wasn't Lucy's frst offense. The frst had been years before, back in Virginia.

That was a long time ago, and the old records are meager: they give only a few bare facts and no setting for the facts. From them and from other sources, however, a probable story can be reconstructed. The essential elements, at any rate, are well established.

The Virginia home of the Hanks family had been on a narrow strip of land bounded on one side by the Rappahannock River, on the other by the Potomac. On this same narrow strip of land dwelt the Washingtons and the Lees, the Carters and the Fauntleroys, and many another snuff-and-silk-breeches family. These aristocrats attended services at Christ Church, and so did the poor and illiterate families of the neighborhood such as the Hankses.

Lucy Hanks was present, as usual, on the second Sunday in November, 1781, when General Washington caused a great craning of necks by bringing General La Fayette to church, as his guest. Every one was eager to see the distinguished Frenchman who, only a month before, had helped Washington capture the army of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown.

After the last hymn had been sung that morning and the benediction pronounced, the parishioners marched by in single file, shaking hands with the two military heroes.




But La Fayette had a predilection for other things besides military tactics and affairs of state. He took a profound interest in beautiful young ladies; and it was his custom, on being introduced to one that appealed to him, to pay her the compliment of a kiss. On this particular morning he kissed seven girls in front of Christ Church; and in doing so he caused more comment than had the third chapter of the Gospel according to St. Luke, which had been read so sonorously by the rector. One of the seven fortunate girls that he kissed was Lucy Hanks.

This kiss started a chain of events that did as much to modify the future of the United States as did all the battles La Fayette fought for us. Perhaps more.

There was a bachelor in the congregation that morning—a rich, aristocratic bachelor who for a long time had known vaguely of the Hanks family, an illiterate, poverty-stricken tribe that moved in a world far below his. But this morning—of course it may have been pure imagination—he thought that La Fayette put just a trife more ardor and enthusiasm into the kiss he gave Lucy Hanks than in those he bestowed upon the other girls.

This planter looked up to the French general, both as a military genius and as a connoisseur of beautiful women. So he fell to dreaming now of Lucy Hanks. And when he stopped to think of it, he knew that some of the world's most celebrated beauties had been bred in circumstances as poor as Lucy's—some in circumstances even more humble. There was Lady Hamilton, for example; and Madame DuBarry, the illegitimate child of a poverty-stricken dressmaker. DuBarry herself was almost illiterate, yet she all but ruled France under Louis XV. Theywere comforting, these historical precedents; and they helped to dignify the bachelor's desires.

This was Sunday. He turned the matter over in his mind all day Monday; and on Tuesday morning he rode over to the dirtfoor cabin that the Hanks tribe occupied and hired Lucy to be a servant in the farm-house on his plantation.

He already owned a number of slaves, and he didn't need another servant. Nevertheless he hired Lucy, gave her some light tasks about the house, and didn't ask her to associate with the slaves.

It was the custom of many of the wealthy families of Virginia at that time to educate their sons in England. Lucy's employer had attended Oxford, and he had brought back to America a collection of books that he cherished. One day he drifted into the library and found Lucy seated, dust-cloth in hand, poring over the illustrations in a history book.

That was an odd thing for a servant to be doing. But, instead of censuring her, he closed the library door and sat down and read her the captions underneath the pictures, and told her something of what they meant.

She listened with very evident interest; and finally, to his surprise, she confessed that she wanted to learn to read and write.

Just how astonishing that aspiration was in a servant-girl in the year of our Lord 1781, it is diffcult now to understand. Virginia at that time did not have any free schools; not half the property-owners of the State could sign their names to a deed, and virtually all of the women made their marks when transferring land.

Yet here was a servant-girl aspiring to read and write. The best people in Virginia would have called it dangerous, if not revolutionary. But the idea appealed to Lucy's employer, and he volunteered to be her tutor. That evening, after supper, he called her into the library and began teachingher the letters of the alphabet. A few evenings later he put his hand over hers as it grasped the quill, and showed her how to form the letters. For a long time after that he taught her, and to his credit let it be recorded that he did a very good job. There is one specimen of her handwriting still in existence, and it shows that she wrote with a bold, self-confdent fourish. There are spirit and personality and character in her handwriting; and she not only used the word “approbation,” but spelled it correctly. That was no little achievement at a time when the orthography of men like George Washington was not always fawless.

And when the reading and spelling lessons were finished for the evening Lucy and her tutor sat side by side in the library, looking at the dancing fames in the freplace, and watching the moon rise over the rim of the forest.

She fell in love with him, and trusted him; but she trusted him too far.... Then came weeks of anxiety. She couldn't eat. She hardly slept. She worried a haggard look into her face. When she could no longer deny the truth even to herself she told him. For a moment he considered marrying her. But only for a moment. Family. Friends. Social position. Complications. Unpleasant scenes.... No. Besides, he was begining to tire of her. So he gave her some money and sent her away.

As the months went by people pointed at Lucy and shunned her.

One Sunday morning she created a sensation by shamelessly bringing her baby to church. The good women of the congregation were indignant, and one stood up in the meeting-house and demanded that “that slut be sent away.”

That was enough. Lucy's father did not mean to have his daughter insulted any longer. So the Hanks tribe loaded their few earthly possessions into a wagon and traveled out over the Wilderness Road, through the Cumberland Gap, and settled at Fort Harrod, Kentucky. Noone knew them there: they could lie more effectively about the father of Lucy's child.

But in Fort Harrod Lucy was quite as pretty, quite as attractive to men as she had been back in Virginia. She was sought after, and nattered. She fell in love again. This time it was a little easier to stray. Somebody found it out. Somebody told somebody else. Then it was repeated at Ann McGinty's. And, as we have already recorded, the Grand Jury indicted Lucy for fornication. But the sheriff knew Lucy wasn't the kind of woman to have the law upon; so he stuck the summons in his pocket, and went off deer-hunting and left her alone.

That was in November. In March the court met again. And when it met, a certain woman appeared with further gossip and slander about Lucy and demanded that the hussy be haled into court and made to answer to the charges against her. So another summons was issued; but high-spirited Lucy tore it up and fung it into the face of the man who served it. In May the court would convene again; and Lucy would doubtless have been forced into court at that time, had not a remarkable young man appeared on the scene.

His name was Henry Sparrow. He rode into town, tied his horse in front of her cabin, and went in.

“Lucy,” he probably said to her, “I don't give a damn about what these women are saying about you. I love you and want you to be my wife.” At any rate, he did ask her to marry him.

However, she was not willing to marry immediately. She was not willing to have the gossips of the town say that Sparrow had been forced into matrimony.

“We'll wait a year, Henry,” she insisted. “During that time I want to prove to every one that I can live a decent life. If at the end of that time, you still want me, come; I'll be waiting for you.”

Henry Sparrow took out the license at once, April 26, 1790, and nothing more was heard of the summons. Almost a year later they were married.

That set the Ann McGinty crowd to shaking their heads and wagging their tongues: the marriage wouldn't last long, Lucy would be up to her old tricks again. Henry Sparrow heard this talk. Every one heard it. He wanted to shield Lucy. So he suggested that they move farther West and begin life all over again in kindlier surroundings. She refused that customary means of escape. She wasn't bad, she said; and she held her head high as she said it. She wasn't going to run away. She was determined to settle down there in Fort Harrod and fght it out.

And she did. She reared eight children and redeemed her name in the very community where it had once been a signal for coarse jests.

In time two of her sons became preachers; and one of her grandsons, the son of her illegitimate daughter, became President of the United States. His name was Abraham Lincoln.




I have told this story to show Lincoln's more immediate ancestry. He himself set great store by his well-bred Virginia grandfather.

William H. Herndon was Lincoln's law partner for twenty-one years. He probably knew Lincoln better than any other man who ever lived. Fortunately, he wrote a three-volume biography of Lincoln that appeared in 1888. It is one of the most important of the multitude of works on Lincoln. I quote now from pages 3 and 4 of Volume I:

On the subject of his ancestry and origin I only remember one time when Mr. Lincoln ever referred to it. It was about 1850, when he and I were driving in his one-horse buggy to the court in Menard county, Illinois. The suit we were going to try was one in which we were likely, either directly or collaterally, to touch upon the subject of hereditary traits. During the ride he spoke, for the first time in my hearing, of his mother, dwelling on her characteristics, and mentioning or enumerating what qualities he inherited from her. He said, among other things, that she was the illegitimate daughter of Lucy Hanks and a well-bred Virginia farmer or planter; and he argued that from this last source came his power of analysis, his logic, his mental activity, his ambition, and all the qualities that distinguished him from the other members and descendants of the Hanks family. His theory in discussing the matter of hereditary traits has been, that, for certain reasons, illegitimate children are oftentimes sturdier and brighter than those born in lawful wedlock; and in his case, he believed that his better nature and finer qualities came from this broad-minded, unknown Virginian. The revelation—painful as it was—called up the recollection of his mother, and, as the buggy jolted over the road, he added ruefully, “God bless my mother; all that I am or ever hope to be I owe to her,” and immediately lapsed into silence. Our interchange of ideas ceased, and we rode on for some time without exchanging a word. He was sad and absorbed. Burying himself in thought, and musing no doubt over the disclosure he had just made, he drew round him a barrier which I feared to penetrate. His words and melancholy tone made a deep impression on me. It was an experience I can never forget.

Lincoln's mother, Nancy Hanks, was brought up by her aunt and uncle, and probably had no schooling at all. We know she could not write, for she made her mark when signing a deed.

She lived deep in the somber woods and made few friends; and, when she was twenty-two, she married one of the most illiterate and lowly men in all Kentucky—a dull, ignorant daylaborer and deer-hunter. His name was Thomas Lincoln, but the people in the backwoods and canebrake settlements where he lived called him “Linkhorn.”

Thomas Lincoln was a rover, a drifter, a ne'er-do-well, floating about from one place to another, taking any kind of job he could get when hunger drove him to it. He worked on roads, cut brush, trapped bear, cleared land, plowed corn, built log cabins; and the old records show that on three different occasions he was employed to guard prisoners, with a shot-gun. In 1805 Hardin County, Kentucky, paid him six cents an hour for catching and whipping recalcitrant slaves.

He had no money sense whatever: he lived for fourteen years on one farm in Indiana, and during that period he was unable to save and pay as much as ten dollars a year on his land. At a time when he was so poor that his wife had to pin her dresses together with wild thorns, he went to a store in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, and bought a pair of silk suspenders for himself—and bought them on credit. Shortly after that, at an auction sale, he paid three dollars for a sword. Probably he wore his silk suspenders and carried his sword even when going barefoot.

Shortly after his marriage he moved to town and tried to make a living as a carpenter. He got a job building a mill, but he did not square his timbers or cut them the right length. So his employer sharply refused to pay him for his bungling efforts, and three lawsuits followed.

Tom Lincoln had come from the woods, and, dull as he was, he soon realized now that he belonged to the woods. He took his wife back to a poor, stony farm on the edge of the forest, and never again did he have the temerity to forsake the soil for the village.

Not far from Elizabethtown there was a vast stretch of treeless land known as “the barrens.” For generations the Indians had started fres there and burned away the forests and brush and undergrowth, so that the coarse prairie-grass could grow in the sun, and the buffaloes would come there to wallow and graze.

In December, 1808, Tom Lincoln purchased a farm on “the barrens” for sixty-six and two thirds cents per acre. There was a hunter's hut on it, a crude sort of cabin surrounded with wild crab-apple trees; and half a mile away fowed the South Fork of Nolin Creek, where the dogwood blossomed in the spring. In the summertime, hawks circled lazily in the blue overhead, and the tall grasses surged in the wind like an illimitable sea of green. Few people had had the poor judgment to settle there. So in the wintertime it was one of the most lonely and desolate regions in all Kentucky.

And it was in a hunter's hut on the edge of these lonely barrens, deep in the winter of 1809, that Abraham Lincoln came into the world. He was born on a Sunday morning—born on a bed of poles covered with corn husks. It was storming outside, and the February wind blew the snow through the cracks between the logs and drifted it across the bearskin that covered Nancy Hanks and her baby. She was destined to die nine years later, at the age of thirty-fve, worn out by the strain and hardships of pioneer life. She never knew much of happiness. Wherever she lived, she was hounded by gossip about her illegitimate birth. What a pity she could not have looked into the future that morning, and seen the marble temple that a grateful people have now erected on the spot which she then consecrated with her suffering!

The paper money in circulation at that time, in the wilderness, was often of very doubtful value. Much of it was worthless. So hogs, venison hams, whisky, coon-skins, bear-hides, and farm produce were much used asmediums of exchange. Even preachers sometimes took whisky as part pay for their services. In the autumn of 1816, when Abraham was seven years old, old Tom Lincoln bartered his Kentucky farm for about four hundred gallons of corn whisky, and moved his family into the gloom and solitude of the wild and desolate forests of Indiana. Their nearest neighbor was a bear-hunter; and all about them the trees and brush and grape-vines and undergrowth were so thick that a man had to cut and hack his way through it. This was the spot, “Rite in the Brush,” as Dennis Hanks described it, where Abraham Lincoln was to spend the next fourteen years of his life.

The first snow of winter was already falling when the family arrived; and Tom Lincoln hastily built what was then known as “a three-faced camp.” To-day it would be called a shed. It had no foor, no door, no windows—nothing but three sides and a roof of poles and brush. The fourth side was entirely open to wind and snow and sleet and cold. Nowadays an up-to-date farmer in Indiana wouldn't winter his cattle or hogs in such a crude shelter, but Tom Lincoln felt it was good enough for himself and his family all during the long winter of 1816—17, one of the severest and most violent winters in our history.

Nancy Hanks and her children slept there that winter like dogs, curled up on a heap of leaves and bearskins dumped on the dirt foor in a corner of the shed.

As for food, they had no butter, no milk, no eggs, no fruit, no vegetables, not even potatoes. They lived chiefy on wild game and nuts.

Tom Lincoln tried to raise hogs, but the bears were so hungry that they seized the hogs and ate them alive.

For years, there in Indiana, Abraham Lincoln endured more terrible poverty than did thousands of the slaves whom he would one day liberate.

Dentists were almost unknown in that region, and the nearest doctor was thirty-five miles away; so when Nancy Lincoln had a toothache, probably old Tom Lincoln did what the other pioneers did; he whittled out a hickory peg, set the end of it against the complaining molar, and hit the peg a hard blow with a rock. From the earliest times in the Middle West the pioneers suffered from a mysterious malady known as the “milk sick.” It was fatal to cattle, sheep, and horses, and sometimes carried off entire communities of people. No one knew what caused it, and for a hundred years it baffled the medical profession. It was not until the beginning of the present century that science showed that the poisoning was due to animals eating a plant known as white snakeroot. The poison was transmitted to humans through the milk of cows. White snakeroot thrives in wooded pastures and deeply shaded ravines, and to this day it continues to take its toll of human life. Every year the Department of Agriculture of the State of Illinois posts placards in the county court-houses, warning farmers that if they do not eradicate this plant, they may die.

In the autumn of 1818 this dreadful scourge came to the Buckhorn Valley of Indiana, wiping out many families. Nancy Lincoln helped nurse the wife of Peter Brooner, the bearhunter, whose cabin was only half a mile away. Mrs. Brooner died, and Nancy herself suddenly felt ill. Her head swam, and sharp pains shot through her abdomen. Vomiting severely, she was carried home to her wretched pallet of leaves and skins. Her hands and feet were cold, but her vitals seemed to be on fre. She kept calling for water. Water. Water. More water.

Tom Lincoln had a profound faith in signs and omens; so, on the second night of her illness, when a dog howled long and piteously outside the cabin, he abandoned all hope and said she was going to die.

Finally Nancy was unable even to raise her head from the pillow, and she could not talk above a whisper. Beckoning Abraham and his sister to her, she tried to speak. They bent over to catch her words: she pleaded with them to be good to each other, to live as she had taught them, and toworship God.

These were her last words, for her throat and entire intestinal tract were already in the first stages of paralysis. She sank into a prolonged coma, and fnally died on the seventh day of her illness, October 5, 1818.

Tom Lincoln put two copper pennies on her eyelids, to hold them shut; and then went out into the forest and felled a tree and cut it into rough, uneven boards and fastened these together with wooden pegs; and in this crude coffn he placed the tired, worn body of the sad-faced daughter of Lucy Hanks.

Two years before, he had brought her into this settlement on a sled; and now, again on a sled, he hauled her body to the summit of a thickly wooded hill, a quarter of a mile away, and buried her without service or ceremony.

So perished the mother of Abraham Lincoln. We shall probably never know what she looked like or what manner of woman she was, for she spent most of her short life in the gloomy forests, and made only a faint impression upon the few people who crossed her path.

Shortly after Lincoln's death one of his biographers set out to get some information about the President's mother. She had been dead then for half a century. He interviewed the few people living who had ever seen her, but their memories were as vague as a faded dream. They were unable to agree even as to her physical appearance. One described her as a “heavy built, squatty woman,” but another said she had a “spare, delicate form.” One man thought she had black eyes, another described them as hazel, another was sure they were bluish green. Dennis Hanks, her cousin, who had lived under the same roof with her for ffteen years, wrote that she had “lite hair.” After further refection, he reversed himself and said her hair was black.

For sixty years after her death there was not so much as a stone to mark her resting-place, so that to-day only the approximate position of hergrave is known. She is buried beside her aunt and uncle, who reared her; but it is impossible to say which of the three graves is hers.

A short time before Nancy's death Tom Lincoln had built a new cabin. It had four sides, but no floor, no windows, no door. A dirty bearskin hung over the entrance, and the interior was dark and foul. Tom Lincoln spent most of his time hunting in the woods, leaving his two motherless children to run the place. Sarah did the cooking, while Abraham kept the fire going and carried water from the spring a mile away. Having no knives and forks, they ate with their fngers, and with fingers that were seldom clean, for water was hard to get and they had no soap. Nancy had probably made her own soft lye soap, but the small supply that she left at her death had long since vanished, and the children didn't know how to make more; and Tom Lincoln wouldn't make it. So they lived on in their poverty and dirt.

During the long, cold winter months they made no attempt to wash their bodies; and few, if any, attempts to wash their soiled and ragged garments. Their beds of leaves and skins grew flthy. No sunlight warmed and purified the cabin. The only light they had was from the fireplace or from hog fat. We know from accurate descriptions of other cabins on the frontier what the womanless Lincoln cabin must have been like. It smelled. It was infested with feas, crawling with vermin.

After a year of this squalor even old Tom Lincoln could stand it no longer; he decided to get a new wife who would clean up.

Thirteen years before he had proposed to a woman in Kentucky named Sarah Bush. She had refused him then and married the jailer of Hardin County, but the jailer had since died and left her with three children and some debts. Tom Lincoln felt that the time was auspicious now for renewing his proposal; so he went to the creek, washed up, scrubbed his grimy hands and face with sand, strapped on his sword, andstarted back through the deep, dark woods to Kentucky.

When he reached Elizabethtown he bought another pair of silk suspenders, and marched whistling down the street.

That was in 1819. Things were happening, and people were talking of progress. A steamship had crossed the Atlantic Ocean!

When Lincoln was fifteen he knew his alphabet and could read a little but with diffculty. He could not write at all. That autumn—1824—a wandering backwoods pedagogue drifted into the settlement along Pigeon Creek and started a school. Lincoln and his sister walked four miles through the forests, night and morning, to study under the new teacher, Azel Dorsey. Dorsey kept what was known as a “blab” school; the children studied aloud. In that way the teacher believed he could tell whether or not they were applying themselves. He marched about the room, switch in hand, giving a cut to those who were silent. With such a premium on vociferousness, each pupil strove to out-blab the others. The uproar could often be heard a quarter of a mile away.

While attending this school Lincoln wore a cap of squirrelskin, and breeches made from the hide of a deer. The breeches failed by a considerable stretch to meet the top of his shoes, leaving several inches of sharp, blue shinbone exposed to the wind and snow.

The school was held in a crude cabin barely high enough for the teacher to stand up in. There were no windows; a log had been left out at each side, and the opening covered with greased paper to let in the light. The foor and seats were made of split logs.

Lincoln's reading lessons were chapters from the Bible; and in his writing exercises he took the chirography of Washington and Jefferson ashis models. His handwriting resembled theirs. It was unusually clear and distinct. People commented on it, and the illiterate neighbors walked for miles to have Abraham write their letters.

He was fnding a real tang and zest, now, in learning. The hours at school were all too short, he carried his studies home. Paper was scarce and high, so he wrote on a board with a charcoal stick. Sometimes he ciphered on the fat sides of the hewn logs that formed the cabin walls. Whenever a bare surface became covered with figures and writing he shaved them off with a drawing-knife and began anew.

Too poor to buy an arithmetic, he borrowed one and copied it on sheets of paper about the size of an ordinary letter-head. Then he sewed them together with twine, and so had a homemade arithmetic of his own. At the time of his death his stepmother still had portions of this book.

Now he began to exhibit a trait which sharply distinguished him from the rest of the backwoods scholars. He wanted to write out his opinions on various topics; at times he even broke into verse. And he took his verse and prose composition to William Wood, a neighbor, for criticism. He memorized and recited his rhymes, and his essays attracted attention. A lawyer was so impressed with his article on national politics that he sent it away and had it published. A newspaper in Ohio featured an article he wrote on temperance.

But this was later. His frst composition here in school was inspired by the cruel sports of his playmates. They used to catch terrapins and put burning coals on their backs. Lincoln pleaded with them to stop it, and ran and kicked off the coals with his bare feet. His frst essay was a plea for mercy to animals. Already the boy was showing that deep sympathy for the suffering which was to be so characteristic of the man.

Five years later he attended another school irregularly— “by littles,” as he phrased it.

Thus ended all his formal attempts at education, with a total of not more than twelve months of schooling.

When he went to Congress in 1847 and filled out a biographical blank, he came to the question, “What has been your education?” He answered it with one word: “Defective.”

After he was nominated for the Presidency he said: “When I came of age, I did not know much. Still, somehow, I could read, write, and cipher to the rule of three; but that was all. I have not been to school since. The little advance I now have upon this store of education, I have picked up from time to time under the pressure of necessity.”

And who had been his teachers? Wandering, benighted pedagogues who had faith in witches and believed that the world was fat. Yet, during these broken and irregular periods, he had developed one of the most valuable assets any man can have, even from a university education: a love of knowledge and a thirst for learning.

The ability to read opened up a new and magic world for him, a world he had never dreamed of before. It changed him. It broadened his horizon and gave him vision; and, for a quarter of a century, reading remained the dominant passion of his life. His stepmother had brought a little library of fve volumes with her: the Bible, Aesop's Fables, “Robinson Crusoe,” “the Pilgrim's Progress,” and “Sinbad the Sailor.” The boy pored over these priceless treasures. He kept the Bible and Aesop's Fables within easy reach and read them so often that they profoundly affected his style, his manner of talking, his method of presenting arguments.

But these books weren't enough. He longed for more things to read, but he had no money. So he began to borrow books, newspapers, anything in print. Walking down to the Ohio River, he borrowed a copy of the Revised Laws of Indiana from a lawyer. Then, for the frst time, he read the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States.He borrowed two or three biographies from a neighboring farmer for whom he had often grubbed stumps and hoed corn. One was the Life of Washington by Parson Weems. It fascinated Lincoln, and he read it at night as long as he could see; and, when he went to sleep, he stuck it in a crack between the logs so that he could begin it again as soon as daylight fltered into the hut. One night a storm blew up, and the book was soaked. The owner refused to take it back, so Lincoln had to cut and shock fodder for three days to pay for it.

But in all his book-borrowing expeditions, he never made a richer find than “Scott's Lessons.” This book gave him instruction in public speaking, and introduced him to the renowned speeches of Cicero and Demosthenes and those of Shakespeare's characters.

With “Scott's Lessons” open in his hand, he would walk back and forth under the trees, declaiming Hamlet's instructions to the players, and repeating Antony's oration over the dead body of Caesar: “Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears; I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.”

When he came across a passage that appealed especially to him, he would chalk it down on a board if he had no paper. Finally he made a crude scrap-book. In this he wrote all his favorites, using a buzzard's quill for a pen and pokeberry juice for ink. He carried the scrap-book with him and studied it until he could repeat many long poems and speeches by heart.

When he went out in the feld to work his book went with him. While the horses rested at the end of the corn row he sat on the top rail of a fence and studied. At noontime, instead of sitting down and eating with the rest of the family, he took a corn-dodger in one hand and a book in the other and, hoisting his feet higher than his head, lost himself in the lines of print.

When court was in session Lincoln would often walk ffteen miles to the river towns to hear the lawyers argue. Later, when he was out working in the felds with other men, he would now and then drop the grub-hoe orhay-fork, mount a fence, and repeat the speeches he had heard the lawyers make down at Rockport or Boonville. At other times he mimicked the shouting hard-shell Baptist preachers who held forth in the Little Pigeon Creek church on Sundays.

Abe often carried “Quinn's Jests,” a joke-book, to the fields; and when he sat astride a log and read parts of it aloud, the woods resounded with the loud guffaws of his audience; but the weeds throve in the corn rows and the wheat yellowed in the felds.

The farmers who were hiring Lincoln complained that he was lazy, “awful lazy.” He admitted it. “My father taught me to work,” he said, “but he never taught me to love it.”

Old Tom Lincoln issued peremptory orders: all this foolishness had to stop. But it didn't stop; Abe kept on telling his jokes and making his speeches. One day—in the presence of others—the old man struck him a blow in the face and knocked him down. The boy wept, but he said nothing. There was already growing up between father and son an estrangement that would last for the rest of their lives. Although Lincoln looked after his father fnancially in his old age, yet when the old man lay on his death-bed, in 1851, the son did not go to see him, “If we met now,” he said, “it is doubtful whether it would not be more painful than pleasant.”

In the winter of 1830 the “milk sick” came again, spreading death once more through the Buckhorn Valley of Indiana.

Filled with fear and discouragement, the roving and migratory Tom Lincoln disposed of his hogs and corn, sold his stump-infested farm for eighty dollars, made a cumbersome wagon—the first he had ever owned—loaded his family and furniture into it, gave Abe the whip, yelled at the oxen, and started out for a valley in Illinois which the Indians called the Sangamon, “the land of plenty to eat.”

For two weeks the oxen crept slowly forward as the heavy wagoncreaked and groaned over the hills and through the deep forests of Indiana and out across the bleak, desolate, uninhabited prairies of Illinois, carpeted then with withered yellow grass that grew six feet tall under the summer sun.

At Vincennes Lincoln saw a printing-press for the frst time; he was then twenty-one.

At Decatur the emigrants camped in the court-house square; and, twenty-six years later, Lincoln pointed out the exact spot where the wagon had stood.

“I didn't know then that I had sense enough to be a lawyer,” he said.

Herndon tells us:

Mr. Lincoln once described this journey to me. He said the ground had not yet yielded up the frosts of winter; that during the day the roads would thaw out on the surface and at night freeze over again, thus making travelling, especially with oxen, painfully slow and tiresome. There were, of course, no bridges, and the party were consequently driven to ford the streams, unless by a circuitous route they could avoid them. In the early part of the day the latter were also frozen slightly, and the oxen would break through a square yard of thin ice at every step. Among other things which the party brought with them was a pet dog, which trotted along after the wagon. One day the little fellow fell behind and failed to catch up till after they had crossed the stream. Missing him they looked back, and there, on the opposite bank, he stood, whining and jumping about in great distress. The water was running over the broken edges of the ice, and the poor animal was afraid to cross. It would not pay to turn the oxen and wagon back and ford the stream again in order to recover a dog, and so the majority, in their anxiety to move forward, decided to go on without him. “But I could not endure the idea of abandoning even a dog,” related Lincoln. “Pulling off shoes and socks I waded across the stream and triumphantly returned with the shivering animal under my arm. His frantic leaps of joy and other evidences of a dog's gratitude amply repaid me for all the exposure I had undergone.”

While the oxen were pulling the Lincolns across the prairies Congress was debating with deep and ominous emotion the question of whether or not a State had a right to withdraw from the Union; and during that debate Daniel Webster arose in the United States Senate and, in his deep, golden, bell-like voice, delivered a speech which Lincoln afterward regarded “as the grandest specimen of American oratory.” It is known as “Webster's Reply to Hayne” and ends with the memorable words which Lincoln later adopted as his own political religion: “Liberty and Union, now and forever, one and inseparable!”

This cyclonic issue of secession was to be settled a third of a century later, not by the mighty Webster, the gifted Clay, or the famous Calhoun, but by an awkward, penniless, obscure driver of oxen who was now heading for Illinois, wearing a coonskin cap and buckskin trousers, and singing with ribald gusto:

Hail Columbia, happy land,

If you ain't drunk, then I'll be damned.

The Lincolns settled near Decatur, Illinois, on a stretch of timber land running along a bluff overlooking the Sangamon River.

Abe helped to fell trees, erect a cabin, cut brush, clear the land, break ffteen acres of sod with a yoke of oxen, plant it to corn, split rails, and fence the property in.

The next year he worked as a hired man in the neighborhood, doing odd jobs for farmers: plowing, pitching hay, mauling rails, butchering hogs.

The frst winter Abe Lincoln spent in Illinois was one of the coldest the State had known. Snow drifted ffteen feet deep on the prairies; cattle died, the deer and wild turkey were almost exterminated, and even people were frozen to death.

During this winter Lincoln agreed to split a thousand rails for a pair of trousers made from brown jean cloth dyed with white-walnut bark. He had to travel three miles each day to work. Once, while crossing the Sangamon, his canoe was upset, he was thrown into the icy water, and before he could reach the nearest house, Major Warnick's, his feet froze. For a month he was unable to walk, and so he spent that time lying in front of the fireplace at Major Warnick's telling stories, and reading a volume of the Statutes of Illinois.

Prior to this, Lincoln had courted the major's daughter, but the major frowned on the idea. What? A daughter of his, a Warnick, married to this gawky, uneducated rail-splitter? A man without land, without cash, and without prospects? Never!

True, Lincoln didn't own any land; and that wasn't all—he didn't want to own any. He had spent twenty-two years on farms, and he had had enough of pioneer farming. He hated the grinding toil, the lonely monotony of the life. Longing for distinction, as well as for contact with other social beings, he wanted a job where he could meet people and gather a crowd around him and keep them roaring at his stories.

While living back in Indiana Abe had once helped foat a fatboat down the river to New Orleans, and what fun he had had! Novelty. Excitement.Adventure. One night while the boat was tied up to the shore at the plantation of Madame Duchesne, a gang of Negroes, armed with knives and clubs, climbed aboard. They meant to kill the crew, throw their bodies into the river, and foat the cargo down to the thieves' headquarters at New Orleans.

Lincoln seized a club, and with his long, powerful arms knocked three of the marauders into the river, then chased the others ashore; but, in the fght, one of the Negroes slashed Lincoln's forehead with a knife and left over his right eye a scar that he carried to his grave.

No, Tom Lincoln could not hold the boy Abe to a pioneer farm.

Having seen New Orleans once, Abe now got himself another river job. For ffty cents a day and a bonus he and his stepbrother and second cousin cut down trees, hewed logs, floated them to a sawmill, built a fatboat eighty feet long, loaded it with bacon, corn, and hogs, and foated it down the Mississippi.

Lincoln did the cooking for the crew, steered the boat, told stories, played seven-up, and sang in a loud voice:

The turbaned Turk that scorns the world

And struts about with his whiskers curled

For no other man but himself to see.

This trip down the river made a profound and lasting impression upon Lincoln. Herndon says:

In New Orleans, for the first time Lincoln beheld the true horrors of human slavery. He saw “negroes in chains—whipped and scourged.” Against this inhumanity his sense of right and justice rebelled, and his mind and conscience were awakened to a realization of what he had often heard and read. No doubt, as one of his companions has said, “Slavery ran the iron into him then and there.” One morning in their rambles over the city the trio passed a slave auction. A vigorous and comely mulatto girl was being sold. She underwent a thorough examination at the hands of the bidders; they pinched her flesh and made her trot up and down the room like a horse, to show how she moved, and in order, as the auctioneer said, that “bidders might satisfy themselves” whether the article they were offering to buy was sound or not. The whole thing was so revolting that Lincoln moved away from the scene with a deep feeling of “unconquerable hate.” Bidding his companions follow him he said, “By God, boys, let's get away from this. If ever I get a chance to hit that thing [meaning slavery], I'll hit it hard.”

Lincoln became very popular with Denton Offut, the man who hired him to go to New Orleans. Offut liked his jokes and stories and honesty. He employed the young man to go back to Illinois, fell trees, and build a log-cabin grocery store in New Salem, a tiny village composed of fifteen or twenty cabins perched on a bluff high above the winding Sangamon. Here Lincoln clerked in the store and also ran a grist and sawmill, and here he lived for six years—years that had a tremendous infuence on his future.

The village had a wild, pugnacious, hell-raising gang of ruffians called the Clary's Grove Boys, a crowd who boasted that they could drink more whisky, swear more profanely, wrestle better, and hit harder than any other group in all Illinois.

At heart they weren't a bad lot. They were loyal, frank, generous, and sympathetic, but they loved to show off. So when the loud-mouthed Denton Offut came to town and proclaimed the physical prowess of his grocery clerk, Abe Lincoln, the Clary's Grove Boys were delighted. Theywould show this upstart a thing or two.

But the showing was all the other way, for this young giant won their foot-races and jumping contests; and with his extraordinarily long arms he could throw a maul or toss a cannon-ball farther than any of them. Besides, he could tell the kind of funny stories they could understand; and he kept them laughing for hours at his back-woods tales.

He reached the high-water mark of his career in New Salem, as far as the Clary's Grove Boys were concerned, on the day all the town gathered under the white-oak trees to see him wrestle with their leader, Jack Armstrong. When Lincoln laid Armstrong out, he had arrived, he had achieved the ultimate. From that time on the Clary's Grove Boys gave him their friendship and crowned him with their allegiance. They appointed him judge of their horse-races and referee of their cock-fights. And when Lincoln was out of work and had no home, they took him into their cabins and fed him.

Lincoln found here in New Salem an opportunity he had been seeking for years, an opportunity to conquer his fears and learn to speak in public. Back in Indiana the only chance that he had had at this sort of thing had been in talking to little groups of laborers in the felds. But here in New Salem there was an organized “literary society” that met every Saturday night in the dining-room of the Rutledge tavern. Lincoln joined it with alacrity and took a leading part on its program, telling stories, reading verses that he had written himself, making extemporaneous talks on such subjects as the navigation of the Sangamon River, and debating the various questions of the day.

This activity was priceless. It widened his mental horizon and awakened his ambition. He discovered that he had an unusual ability to infuence other men by his speech. That knowledge developed his courage and self-confdence as nothing else had ever done.

In a few months Offut's store failed and Lincoln was out of a job. Anelection was coming on, the State was seething with politics, and so he proposed to cash in on his ability to speak.

With the aid of Mentor Graham, the local school-teacher, he toiled for weeks over his frst address to the public, in which he announced that he was a candidate for the State Legislature. He stated that he favored “internal improvements... the navigation of the Sangamon... better education... justice,” and so on.

In closing he said:

“I was born and have ever remained in the most humble walks of life. I have no wealthy or popular relatives or friends to recommend me.” And he concluded with this pathetic sentence: “But if the good people in their wisdom shall see ft to keep me in the background, I have been too familiar with disappointments to be very much chagrined.”

A few days later a horseman dashed into New Salem with the startling news that the great Sac Indian chief, Black Hawk, was on the war-path with his braves, burning homes, capturing women, massacring settlers, and spreading red terror along Rock River.

In a panic Governor Reynolds was calling for volunteers; and Lincoln, “out of work, penniless, a candidate for offce,” joined the forces for thirty days, was elected captain, and tried to drill the Clary's Grove Boys, who shouted back at his commands, “Go to the devil.”

Herndon says Lincoln always regarded his participation in the Black Hawk War “as a sort of holiday affair and chickenstealing expedition.” It was just about that.

Later, in the course of a speech in Congress, Lincoln declared that he didn't attack any redskins, but that he made “charges upon the wild onions.” He said he didn't see any Indians, but that he had “a good many bloody struggles with the mosquitoes.”

Returning from the war, “Captain Lincoln” plunged again into hispolitical campaign, going from cabin to cabin, shaking hands, telling stories, agreeing with every one, and making speeches whenever and wherever he could fnd a crowd.

When the election came he was defeated, although he received all but three of the two hundred and eight votes cast in New Salem.

Two years later he ran again, was elected, and had to borrow money to buy a suit of clothes to wear to the legislature.

He was reelected in 1836, 1838, and 1840.




There was living in New Salem at that time a ne'er-do-well whose wife had to take in boarders while he fished and played the fiddle and recited poetry. Most of the people in town looked down upon Jack Kelso as a failure. But Lincoln liked him, chummed with him, and was greatly infuenced by him. Before he met Kelso, Shakspere and Burns had meant little to Lincoln; they had been merely names, and vague names at that. But now as he sat listening to Jack Kelso reading “Hamlet” and reciting “Macbeth,” Lincoln realized for the frst time what symphonies could be played with the English language. What a thing of infnite beauty it could be! What a whirlwind of sense and emotion!

Shakspere awed him, but Bobby Burns won his love and sympathy. He felt even a kinship with Burns. Burns had been poor like Lincoln. Burns had been born in a cabin no better than the one that had seen Abe's birth. Burns too had been a plowboy. But a plowboy to whom the plowing up of the nest of a field-mouse was a tiny tragedy, an event worthy of being caught up and immortalized in a poem. Through the poetry of Burns and Shakspere, a whole new world of meaning and feeling and loveliness opened up to Abraham Lincoln.

But to him the most astounding thing of all was this: neither Shakspere nor Burns had gone to college. Neither of them had had muchmore schooling and education than he.

At times he dared to think that perhaps he too, the unschooled son of illiterate Tom Lincoln, might be ftted for fner things. Perhaps it would not be necessary for him to go on forever selling groceries or working as a blacksmith.

From that time on Burns and Shakspere were his favorite authors. He read more of Shakspere than of all other authors put together, and this reading left its imprint upon his style. Even after he reached the White House, when the burdens and worries of the Civil War were chiseling deep furrows in his face, he devoted much time to Shakspere. Busy as he was, he discussed the plays with Shaksperian authorities, and carried on a correspondence regarding certain passages. The week he was shot, he read “Macbeth” aloud for two hours to a circle of friends.

The infuence of Jack Kelso, the shiftless New Salem fsherman, had reached to the White House....

The founder of New Salem and the keeper of the tavern was a Southerner named James Rutledge, and he had a most attractive daughter, Ann. She was only nineteen when Lincoln met her—a beautiful girl with blue eyes and auburn hair. Despite the fact that she was already engaged to the richest merchant in town, Lincoln fell in love with her.

Ann had already promised to become the wife of John McNeil, but it was understood that they were not to be married until she had had two years of college.

Lincoln had not been in New Salem very long when a strange thing happened. McNeil sold his store and said that he was returning to New York State to bring his mother and father and family back to Illinois. But before leaving town he confessed something to Ann Rutledge that almost stunned her. However, she was young and she loved him, and she believed his story.

A few days later, he set out from Salem, waving good-by to Ann andpromising to write often.

Lincoln was postmaster of the village then. The mail arrived by stage-coach twice a week, and there was very little of it, for it cost from six and a quarter cents to twenty-fve to send a letter, depending on the distance it must travel. Lincoln carried the letters about in his hat. When people met him they would ask if he had any mail for them, and he would pull off his hat and look through his collection to see what he had.

Twice each week Ann Rutledge inquired for a letter. Three months passed before the first one arrived. McNeil explained that he had not written sooner because he had been taken sick with a fever while crossing Ohio, and had been in bed for three weeks—part of the time unconscious.

Three more months passed before the next letter came; and when it arrived it was almost worse than no letter at all. It was cold and vague. He said that his father was very ill, that he was being harassed by his father's creditors, and that he did not know when he would be back.

After that Ann watched the mail for months, hoping for more letters which never came. Had he ever really loved her at all? She had begun now to doubt it.

Lincoln, seeing her distress, volunteered to try to fnd McNeil.

“No,” she said, “he knows where I am, and if he doesn't care enough to write to me I am sure I do not care enough to have you try to fnd him.”

Then she told her father of the extraordinary confession that McNeil had made before he left. He had admitted that he had been living under an assumed name for years. His real name was not McNeil, as every one in New Salem believed, but McNamar.

Why had he practised this deception? His father, he explained, had failed in business, back in New York State, and had become heavily involved in debts. He, being the eldest son, had, without disclosing his destination, come West to make money. He feared that if he used his rightname, his family might learn of his whereabouts and follow him, and he would be obliged to support them all. He didn't want to be hampered by any such burden while struggling to make a start. It might delay his progress for years. So he took an assumed name. But now that he had accumulated property he was going to bring his parents to Illinois and let them share his prosperity.

When the story got abroad in the village it created a sensation. People called it a damn lie and branded him as an impostor. The situation looked bad and gossip made the worst of it. He was—well, there was no telling what he was. Perhaps he was already married. Maybe he was hiding from two or three wives. Who knew? Maybe he had robbed a bank. Maybe he had murdered somebody. Maybe he was this. Maybe he was that. He had deserted Ann Rutledge, and she ought to thank God for it.

Such was New Salem's verdict. Lincoln said nothing, but he thought much.

At last the chance for which he had hoped and prayed had come.

The Rutledge tavern was a rough, weather-beaten affair with nothing whatever to distinguish it from a thousand other log cabins along the frontier. A stranger would not have given it a second glance; but Lincoln could not keep his eyes off it now, nor his heart out of it. To him, it flled the earth and towered to the sky, and he never crossed the threshold of it without a quickening of his heart.

Borrowing a copy of Shakspere's plays from Jack Kelso, he stretched himself out on top of the store counter, and, turning over the pages, he read these lines again and again:

But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?

It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.

He closed the book. He could not read. He could not think. He lay there for an hour, dreaming, living over in memory all the lovely things Ann had said the night before. He lived now for only one thing—for the hours that he spent with her.

Quilting parties were popular in those days, and Ann was invariably invited to these affairs, where her slender fingers plied the needle with unusual swiftness and art. Lincoln used to ride with her in the morning to the place where the quilting was to be held, and call for her again in the evening. Once he boldly went into the house—a place where men seldom ventured on such occasions—and sat down beside her. Her heart throbbed, and a food of color rose to her face. In her excitement she made irregular and uncertain stitches, and the older and more composed women noticed it. They smiled. The owner kept this quilt for years, and after Lincoln became President she proudly displayed it to visitors and pointed out the irregular stitches made by his sweetheart.

On summer evenings Lincoln and Ann strolled together along the banks of the Sangamon, where whippoorwills called in the trees and frefies wove golden threads through the night. In the autumn they drifted through the woods when the oaks were faming with color and hickory-nuts were pattering to the ground. In the winter, after the snow had fallen, they walked through the forest, when—

Every oak and ash and walnut

Wore ermine too dear for an earl

And the poorest twig on the elm tree

Was ridged inch-deep with pearl.

For both of them, now, life had taken on a sacred tenderness, a new and strangely beautiful meaning. When Lincoln but stood and looked down into Ann's blue eyes her heart sang within her; and at the mere touch of her hands he caught his breath and was amazed to discover that there was so much felicity in all the world....

A short time before this, Lincoln had gone into business with a drunkard, a preacher's son, named Berry. The little village of New Salem was dying, all its stores were gasping for breath. But neither Lincoln nor Berry could see what was happening, so they bought the wrecks of three of these log-cabin groceries, consolidated them, and started an establishment of their own.

One day a mover who was driving out to Iowa halted his covered wagon in front of the Lincoln & Berry store. The roads were soft, his horses were tired, and the mover decided to lighten his load. So he sold Lincoln a barrel of household plunder. Lincoln didn't want the plunder, but he felt sorry for the horses; he paid the mover ffty cents, and without examining the barrel rolled it into the back room of the store.

A fortnight later he emptied the contents of the barrel out on the floor, idly curious to see what he had bought. There, at the bottom of the rubbish, he found a complete edition of Blackstone's Commentaries on Law; and started to read. The farmers were busy in their fields, and customers were few and far between, so he had plenty of time. And the more he read, the more interested he became. Never before had he been so absorbed in a book. He read until he had devoured all four volumes.

Then he made a momentous decision: he would be a lawyer. He would be the kind of man Ann Rutledge would be proud to marry. She approved his plans, and they were to be married as soon as he completed his law studies and established himself in the profession.

After finishing Blackstone he set out across the prairies for Springfield, twenty miles away, to borrow other law-books from an attorney he had met in the Black Hawk War. On his way home he carried an open book in one hand, studying as he walked. When he struck a knotty passage, he shuffed to a standstill, and concentrated on it until he had mastered the sense.

He kept on studying, until he had conquered twenty or thirty pages, kept on until dusk fell and he could no longer see to read.... The stars came out, he was hungry, he hastened his pace.

He pored over his books now incessantly, having heart for little else. By day he lay on his back, reading in the shade of an elm that grew beside the store, his bare feet angling up against the trunk of the tree. By night he read in the cooper's shop, kindling a light from the waste material lying about. Frequently he read aloud to himself, now and then closing the book and writing down the sense of what he had just read, revising, rephrasing it until it became clear enough for a child to comprehend.

Wherever Lincoln went now—on his rambles along the river, on his walks through the woods, on his way to labor in the felds—wherever he went, a volume of Chitty or Blackstone was under his arm. Once a farmer, who had hired him to cut frewood, came around the corner of the barn in the middle of the afternoon and found Lincoln sitting barefooted on top of the woodpile, studying law.

Mentor Graham told Lincoln that if he aspired to get ahead in politics and law he must know grammar.

“Where can I borrow one?” Lincoln asked.

Graham said that John Vance, a farmer living six miles out in the country, had a copy of Kirkham's Grammar; and Lincoln arose immediately, put on his hat, and was off after the book.

He astonished Graham with the speed with which he masteredKirkham's rules. Thirty years later this schoolmaster said he had taught more than fve thousand students, but that Lincoln was the “most studious, diligent, straightforward young man in the pursuit of knowledge and literature” he had ever met.

“I have known him,” said Mentor Graham, “to study for hours the best way of three to express an idea.”

Having mastered Kirkham's Grammar, Lincoln devoured next Gibbon's “Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire,” Rollin's “Ancient History,” a volume on American military biography, lives of Jefferson, Clay, and Webster, and Tom Paine's “Age of Reason.”

Dressed in “blue cotton roundabout coat, stoga shoes, and pale-blue casinet pantaloons which failed to make the connection with either coat or socks, coming about three inches below the former and an inch or two above the latter,” this extraordinary young man drifted about New Salem, reading, studying, dreaming, telling stories, and making “a host of friends wherever he went.”

The late Albert J. Beveridge, the outstanding Lincoln scholar of his time, says in his monumental biography:

Not only did his wit, kindliness and knowledge attract the people, but his strange clothes and uncouth awkwardness advertised him, the shortness of his trousers causing particular remark and amusement. Soon the name of “Abe Lincoln” became a household word.

Finally the grocery frm of Lincoln & Berry failed. This was to be expected, for, with Lincoln absorbed in his books and Berry half groggy with whisky, the end was inevitable. Without a dollar left to pay for his meals and lodging now, Lincoln had to do any kind of manual labor hecould fnd: he cut brush, pitched hay, built fences, shucked corn, labored in a sawmill, and worked for a while as a blacksmith.

Then, with the aid of Mentor Graham, he plunged into the intricacies of trigonometry and logarithms, prepared himself to be a surveyor, bought a horse and compass on credit, cut a grape-vine to be used as a chain, and started out surveying town lots for thirty-seven and a half cents apiece.

In the meantime the Rutledge tavern also had failed, and Lincoln's sweetheart had had to go to work as a servant in a farmer's kitchen. Lincoln soon got a job plowing corn on the same farm. In the evening he stood in the kitchen wiping the dishes which Ann washed. He was flled with a vast happiness at the very thought of being near her. Never again was he to experience such rapture and such content. Shortly before his death he confessed to a friend that he had been happier as a barefoot farm laborer back in Illinois than he had ever been in the White House.

But the ecstasy of the lovers was as short as it was intense. In August, 1835, Ann fell ill. At frst there was no pain, nothing but great fatigue and weariness. She tried to carry on her work as usual, but one morning she was unable to get out of bed. That day the fever came, and her brother rode over to New Salem for Dr. Allen. He pronounced it typhoid. Her body seemed to be burning, but her feet were so cold that they had to be warmed with hot stones. She kept begging vainly for water. Medical science now knows that she should have been packed in ice and given all the water she could drink, but Dr. Allen didn't know that.

Dreadful weeks dragged by. Finally Ann was so exhausted that she could no longer raise even her hands from the sheets. Dr. Allen ordered absolute rest, visitors were forbidden, and that night when Lincoln came even he was not permitted to see her. But the next day and the following day she kept murmuring his name and calling for him so pitifully that he was sent for. When he arrived, he went to her bedside immediately, thedoor was closed, and they were left alone. This was the last hour of the lovers together.

The next day Ann lost consciousness and remained unconscious until her death.

The weeks that followed were the most terrible period of Lincoln's life. He couldn't sleep. He wouldn't eat. He repeatedly said that he didn't want to live, and he threatened to kill himself. His friends became alarmed, took his pocket-knife away, and watched to keep him from throwing himself into the river. He avoided people, and when he met them he didn't speak, didn't even seem to see them, but appeared to be staring into another world, hardly conscious of the existence of this.

Day after day he walked fve miles to the Concord Cemetery, where Ann was buried. Sometimes he sat there so long that his friends grew anxious, and went and brought him home. When the storms came, he wept, saying that he couldn't bear to think of the rain beating down upon her grave.

Once he was found stumbling along the Sangamon, mumbling incoherent sentences. People feared he was losing his mind.

So Dr. Allen was sent for. Realizing what was wrong, he said Lincoln must be given some kind of work, some activity to occupy his mind.

A mile to the north of town lived one of Lincoln's closest friends, Bowling Greene. He took Lincoln to his home, and assumed complete charge of him. It was a quiet, secluded spot. Behind the house oak-covered bluffs rose and rolled back to the west. In front the fat bottom-lands stretched away to the Sangamon River, framed in trees. Nancy Greene kept Lincoln busy cutting wood, digging potatoes, picking apples, milking the cows, holding the yarn for her as she spun.

The weeks grew into months, and the months into years, but Lincoln continued to grieve. In 1837, two years after Ann's death, he said to afellow-member of the State Legislature:

“Although I seem to others to enjoy life rapturously at times, yet when I am alone I am so depressed that I am afraid to trust myself to carry a pocket-knife.”

From the day of Ann's death he was a changed individual. The melancholy that then settled upon him lifted at times for short intervals; but it grew steadily worse, until he became the saddest man in all Illinois.

Herndon, later his law partner, said:

“If Lincoln ever had a happy day in twenty years, I never knew of it.... Melancholy dripped from him as he walked.”

From this time to the end of his life, Lincoln had a fondness, almost an obsession, for poems dealing with sorrow and death. He would often sit for hours without saying a word, lost in reverie, the very picture of dejection, and then would suddenly break forth with these lines from “The Last Leaf:”

The mossy marbles rest

On the lips that he has prest

In their bloom;

And the names he loved to hear

Have been carved for many a year

On the tomb.

Shortly after Ann's death, he memorized a poem “Mortality” and beginning, “Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?” It became his favorite. He often repeated it to himself when he thought no one else was listening; repeated it to people in the country hotels of Illinois; repeated it in public addresses; repeated it to guests in the White House; wrote copies of it for his friends; and said:

“I would give all I am worth, and go in debt, to be able to write like that.”

He loved the last two stanzas best:

Yea! hope and despondency, pleasure and pain,

Are mingled together in sunshine and rain;

And the smile and the tear and the song and the dirge

Still follow each other, like surge upon surge.



Tis the wink of an eye, 'tis the draught of a breath,

From the blossom of health to the paleness of death,

From the gilded saloon to the bier and the shroud, —

Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?

The old Concord Cemetery, where Ann Rutledge was buried, is a peaceful acre in the midst of a quiet farm, surrounded on three sides by wheat-felds and on the fourth by a blue-grass pasture where cattle feed and sheep graze. The cemetery itself is overgrown now with brush and vines, and is seldom visited by man. In the springtime the quails make their nests in it and the silence of the place is broken only by the bleating of sheep and the call of the bob-white.

For more than half a century the body of Ann Rutledge lay there in peace. But in 1890 a local undertaker started a new cemetery in Petersburg, four miles away. Petersburg already had a beautiful and commodious burying-ground known as the Rose Hill Cemetery; so selling lots in the new one was slow and difficult. Consequently, the greedy undertaker, in an unholy moment, conceived the gruesome scheme of violating the grave of Lincoln's sweetheart, bringing her dust to his cemetery, and using its presence there as an argument to boost sales.

So “on or about the fifteenth of May, 1890—” to quote the exact words of his shocking confession—he opened her grave. And what did he fnd? We know, for there is a quiet old lady still living in Petersburg who told the story to the author of this volume, and made an affdavit to its veracity. She is the daughter of McGrady Rutledge, who was a first cousin of Ann Rutledge. McGrady Rutledge often worked with Lincoln in the felds, helped him as a surveyor, ate with him and shared his bed with him, and probably knew more about Lincoln's love for Ann than any other third person has ever known.

On a quiet summer evening this old lady sat in a rockingchair on her porch and told the author: “I have often heard Pa say that after Ann's death Mr. Lincoln would walk fve miles out to Ann's grave and stay there so long that Pa would get worried and fear something would happen to him, and go and bring him home.... Yes, Pa was with the undertaker when Ann's grave was opened, and I have often heard him tell that the only trace they could fnd of Ann's body was four pearl buttons from her dress.”

So the undertaker scooped up the four pearl buttons, and some dirt and interred them in his new Oakland Cemetery at Petersburg—and then advertised that Ann Rutledge was buried there.

And now, in the summer months, thousands of pilgrims motor there to dream over what purports to be her grave; I have seen them stand with bowed heads and shed tears above the four pearl buttons. Over those four buttons there stands a beautiful granite monument bearing this verse from Edgar Lee Masters' “Spoon River Anthology:”

Out of me unworthy and unknown

The vibrations of deathless music:

“With malice toward none, with charity for all.”

Out of me the forgiveness of millions toward millions,

And the beneficent face of a nation

Shining with justice and truth.

I am Ann Rutledge who sleep beneath these weeds,

Beloved in life of Abraham Lincoln,

Wedded to him, not through union,

But through separation.

Bloom forever, O Republic,

From the dust of my bosom!

But Ann's sacred dust remains in the old Concord Cemetery. The rapacious undertaker could not carry it away—she and her memories are still there. Where the bob-white calls and the wild rose blows, there is the spot that Abraham Lincoln hallowed with his tears, there is the spot where he said his heart lay buried, there would Ann Rutledge wish to be.





6


In March, 1837, two years after Ann's death, Lincoln turned his back on New Salem and rode into Springfeld on a borrowed horse, to begin what he called his “experiment as a lawyer.”

He carried in his saddle-bag all his earthly possessions. The only things he owned were several law-books and some extra shirts and some underwear. He also carried an old blue sock stuffed with six-and-a-quarter-cent and twelve-and-a-half-cent pieces—money that he had collected for postage before the post-offce “winked out” back in New Salem. During this frst year in Springfeld, Lincoln needed cash often, and he needed it badly. He could have spent this money and paid the Government out of his own pocket, but he would have felt that that was dishonest. So when the post-office auditor finally came around for a settlement, Lincoln turnedover to him not only the exact amount, but the exact coins he had taken in as post-master during the preceding year or two.

The morning that Lincoln rode into Springfield, he not only had no cash reserves of his own; but, to make matters worse, he was eleven hundred dollars in debt. He and Berry had lost that amount in their ill-fated grocery venture back in New Salem. Then Berry had drunk himself to death and left Lincoln to shoulder the obligations alone.

To be sure, Lincoln didn't have to pay; he could have pleaded divided responsibility and the failure of the business and have found a legal loophole of escape.

But that wasn't Lincoln's way. Instead, he went to his creditors and promised to pay them every dollar with interest, if they would only give him time. They all agreed, except one, Peter Van Bergen. He brought suit immediately, obtained a judgment, and had Lincoln's horse and surveying instruments sold at public auction. The others waited, however, and Lincoln scraped and saved and denied himself for fourteen years in order to keep faith with them. Even as late as 1848, when he was a member of Congress, he sent part of his salary home to pay off the last remnant of this old grocery debt.

The morning that Lincoln arrived in Springfield, he tied his horse in front of Joshua F. Speed's general store at the northwest corner of the public square; and here is the remainder of the story told in Speed's own words:

He had ridden into town on a borrowed horse, and engaged from the only cabinet-maker in the village a single bedstead. He came into my store, set his saddle-bags on the counter, and enquired what the furniture for a single bedstead would cost. I took slate and pencil, made a calculation, and found the sum for furniture complete would amount to seventeen dollars in all. Said he: “It is probably cheap enough; but I want to say that, cheap as it is, I have not the money to pay. But if you will credit me until Christmas and my experiment here as a lawyer is a success, I will pay you then. If I fail in that I will probably never pay you at all.” The tone of his voice was so melancholy that I felt for him. I looked up at him and I thought then, as I think now, that I never saw so gloomy and melancholy a face in my life. I said to him, “So small a debt seems to affect you so deeply, I think I can suggest a plan by which you will be able to attain your end without incurring any debt. I have a very large room and a very large double bed in it, which you are perfectly welcome to share with me if you choose.” “Where is your room?” he asked. “Upstairs,” said I, pointing to the stairs leading from the store to my room. Without saying a word he took his saddle-bags on his arm, went upstairs, set them down on the floor, came down again, and with a face beaming with pleasure and smiles, exclaimed, “Well, Speed, I'm moved.”

And so, for the next fve and a half years, Lincoln slept in the bed with Speed, over the store, without paying any rent at all.

Another friend, William Butler, took Lincoln into his home and not only boarded him for fve years, but bought many of his clothes for him.

Lincoln probably paid Butler a little something when, as, and if he could; but there was no specifc charge. The whole thing was a haphazard arrangement between friends.

And Lincoln thanked God that it was, for if it hadn't been for the help of Butler and Speed, he could never have made a go of the law.

He went into partnership with another attorney, named Stuart. Stuartdevoted most of his time to politics, and saddled the office routine on Lincoln. But there wasn't much routine to saddle, and there wasn't much of an office. The furnishings consisted of “a small, dirty bed, a buffalo robe, a chair, a bench” and a sort of bookcase containing a few legal volumes.

The offce records show that during the frst six months the frm took in only five fees: one was for two dollars and a half, two were for five dollars each, one was a ten-dollar fee, and they had to take an overcoat as part payment in another case.

Lincoln became so discouraged that he stopped one day at Page Eaton's carpenter shop in Springfeld and confessed that he had a notion to abandon law and go to work as a carpenter. A few years before that, while studying law back in New Salem, Lincoln had seriously thought of giving up his books and becoming a blacksmith.

That frst year in Springfeld was a lonely one for Lincoln. About the only people he met were the men who forgathered of an evening, in the back of Speed's store, to argue politics and kill time. Lincoln wouldn't go to church on Sundays, because, as he said, he wouldn't know how to act in fne churches like those in Springfeld.

Only one woman spoke to him during that frst year, and he wrote to a friend that she wouldn't have spoken “if she could have avoided it.”

But in 1839 a woman came to town who not only spoke to him, but courted him and determined to marry him. Her name was Mary Todd.

Somebody asked Lincoln once why the Todds spelled their name as they did, and he replied that he reckoned that one “d” was good enough for God, but that the Todds had to have two.

The Todds boasted of a genealogical chart extending back to the sixth century. Mary Todd's grandfathers and greatgrandfathers and great-uncles had been generals and governors, and one had been Secretary of the Navy.She, herself, had been educated in a snobbish French school in Lexington, Kentucky, conducted by Madame Victorie Charlotte Le Clere Mentelle and her husband—two French aristocrats who had fed from Paris during the Revolution in order to save their necks from the guillotine. They had drilled Mary to speak French with a Parisian accent, and had taught her to dance the cotillion and the Circassian Circle as the silken courtiers had danced them at Versailles.

Mary was possessed of a high and haughty manner, an exalted opinion of her own superiority, and an abiding conviction that she would one day marry a man who would become President of the United States. Incredible as it seems, she not only believed that, but she openly boasted of it. It sounded silly, and people laughed and said things; but nothing could shake her conviction and nothing could stop her boasting.

Her own sister, speaking of Mary, said she “loved glitter, show, pomp and power,” and was “the most ambitious woman I ever knew.”

Unfortunately, Mary had a temper that was frequently out of control; so one day in 1839, she quarreled with her stepmother, slammed the front door, and walked out of her father's home in a rage and came to live with her married sister in Springfeld.

If she was determined to marry a future President, she had certainly chosen the right place, for there wasn't another spot in all the world where her prospects would have been brighter than there in Springfeld, Illinois. At that time it was a dirty little frontier village, sprawling out over the treeless prairie, with no pavements, no lights, no sidewalks, no sewers. Cattle roamed about the town at will, hogs wallowed in the mud-holes of the principal streets, and piles of rotton manure filled the air with a stench. The total population of the town was only ffteen hundred; but two young men who were destined to be candidates for the Presidency in 1860 lived there in Springfield in 1839—Stephen A. Douglas, candidate forthe Northern wing of the Democratic party, and Abraham Lincoln for the Republicans.

Both of them met Mary Todd, both courted her at the same time, both held her in their arms, and she once stated that both of them had proposed.

When asked which suitor she intended to marry, Mary always answered, according to her sister's report, “Him who has the best prospects of being President.”

And that was tantamount to saying Douglas, for, just then, Douglas's political prospects seemed a hundred times brighter than Lincoln's. Although Douglas was only twenty-six, he had already been nicknamed “the Little Giant,” and he was already Secretary of the State, while Lincoln was only a struggling lawyer living in an attic over Speed's store and hardly able to pay a board bill.

Douglas was destined to become one of the mightiest political forces in the United States years and years before Abe Lincoln was even heard of outside his own State. In fact, two years before Lincoln became President, about the only thing that the average American knew about him was that he had once debated with the brilliant and powerful Stephen A. Douglas.

Mary's relatives all thought she cared more for Douglas than she did for Lincoln, and she probably did. Douglas was far more of a ladies' man; he had more personal charm, better prospects, better manners, and better social standing.

Besides, he had a deep golden voice, a wavy black pompadour, he waltzed superbly, and he paid Mary Todd lovely little compliments.

He was her beau-ideal of a man; and she looked in her mirror, whispering to herself, “Mary Todd Douglas.” It sounded beautiful, and she dreamed dreams and saw herself waltzing with him in the White House....

While Douglas was courting her he had a fght one day, right in the public square in Springfeld, with a newspaper editor—the husband ofone of Mary's dearest friends.

Probably she told him what she thought of that.

And probably she told him also what she thought of his getting drunk at a public banquet, climbing on top of a table and waltzing back and forth, shouting, singing, and kicking wineglasses and roast turkey, whisky bottles and gravy dishes onto the foor.

And if he took another girl to a dance while he was paying her attention, she made a disagreeable scene. The courtship came to nothing. Senator Beveridge says:

Although it was afterwards given out that Douglas had proposed to Mary and was refused because of his bad “morals,” that statement was obviously protective propaganda usual in such cases; for the shrewd, alert and, even then, worldly-wise Douglas never asked Miss Todd to marry him.

Immeasurably disappointed, she tried to arouse Douglas's jealousy by giving her ardent attention to one of his bitter political opponents, Abraham Lincoln. But that didn't bring back Douglas, and she laid her plans to capture Lincoln. Mrs. Edwards, Mary Todd's sister, afterward described the courtship in this fashion:

I have often happened in the room where they were sitting, and Mary invariably led the conversation. Mr. Lincoln would sit at her side and listen. He scarcely said a word, but gazed on her as if irresistibly drawn toward her by some superior and unseen power. He was charmed with her wit, and fascinated by her quick sagacity. But he could not maintain himself in a continued conversation with a lady reared as Mary was.

In July of that year the great gathering of Whigs which had been talked of for months swarmed down upon Springfeld and overwhelmed the town. They came from hundreds of miles around, with banners waving and bands playing. The Chicago delegation dragged half-way across the State a government yawl rigged as a two-masted ship. Music was playing on the ship, girls dancing, cannon belching into the air.

The Democrats had spoken of the Whig candidate, William Henry Harrison, as an old woman who lived in a log cabin and drank hard cider. So the Whigs mounted a log cabin on wheels and drew it through the streets of Springfeld, behind thirty yoke of oxen. A hickory tree swayed beside the cabin; coons were playing in the tree; a barrel of hard cider was on tap by the door.

At night, under the light of faming torches, Lincoln made a political speech.

At one meeting his party, the Whigs, had been accused of being aristocratic and wearing fne clothes while pleading for the votes of the plain people, Lincoln replied:

“I came to Illinois as a poor, strange, friendless, uneducated boy, and started working on a fatboat for eight dollars a month, and I had only one pair of breeches to my back, and they were buckskin. When buckskin gets wet and dried by the sun, it shrinks; and my breeches kept shrinking until they left several inches of my legs bare between the lower part of my breeches and the top of my socks. And while I was growing taller, the breeches were getting wet and becoming shorter and tighter until they left a blue streak around my legs that can be seen to this day. Now, if you call that being a fancily dressed aristocrat, I must plead guilty to the charge.”

The audience whistled and shouted and shrieked its approval.

When Lincoln and Mary reached the Edwards house, she told himhow proud she was of him, that he was a great speaker, and that some day he would be President.

He looked down at her, standing beside him in the moonlight, and her manner told him everything. Reaching over, he took her in his arms and kissed her tenderly....

The wedding-day was set for the frst of January, 1841.

That was only six months away, but many a storm was to brew and blow before then.

Mary Todd and Abraham Lincoln hadn't been engaged very long before she wanted to make him over. She didn't like the way he dressed. She often contrasted him with her father. Almost every morning for a dozen years she had seen Robert Todd walking down the streets of Lexington, carrying a goldheaded cane, clad in a blue broadcloth coat, and wearing white linen trousers strapped under his boots. But Lincoln in hot weather didn't wear a coat at all; and what was worse, sometimes he didn't wear even a collar. Usually he had only one gallus holding up his trousers, and when a button came off he whittled a peg and pinned things together with that.

Such crudeness irritated Mary Todd, and she told him so. But, unfortunately, she didn't use any tact or diplomacy or sweetness in her telling.

Though at Madame Victorie Charlotte Le Clere Mentelle's school back in Lexington she had been taught to dance the cotillion, she had been taught nothing about the fine art of handling people. So she took the surest way, the quickest way to annihilate a man's love: she nagged. She made Lincoln so uncomfortable that he wanted to avoid her. Insteadof coming to see her two or three nights a week now, as he had formerly done, he sometimes let ten days drift by without calling; and she wrote him complaining letters, censuring him for his neglect.

Presently Matilda Edwards came to town. Matilda was a tall, stately, charming blonde, a cousin of Ninian W. Edwards, Mary Todd's brother-in-law. She too took up her residence in the spacious Edwards mansion. And when Lincoln called to see Mary, Matilda contrived to be very much in evidence. She couldn't speak French with a Parisian accent or dance the Circassian Circle, but she knew how to handle men, and Lincoln grew very fond of her. When she swept into the room, Lincoln was so interested in watching her that he sometimes ceased to listen to what Mary Todd was saying. That made Mary indignant. Once he took Mary to a ball; but he didn't care for dancing, so he let her dance with other men while he sat in a corner talking to Matilda.

Mary accused him of being in love with Matilda, and he didn't deny it; she broke down and wept, and demanded that he cease even looking at Matilda.

What had once been a promising love-affair had now degenerated into a thing of strife and dissension and fault-fnding.

Lincoln now saw that he and Mary were opposites in every way: in training, in background, in temperament, in tastes, in mental outlook. They irritated each other constantly, and Lincoln realized that their engagement ought to be broken, that their marriage would be disastrous.

Mary's sister and brother-in-law both arrived at a similar conclusion. They urged Mary to abandon all thought of marrying Lincoln, warning her over and over that they were strikingly unft for each other, and that they could never be happy.

But Mary refused to listen.

Lincoln, after weeks of trying to screw up his courage to tell herthe painful truth, came into Speed's store one night, walked back to the freplace, drew a letter out of his pocket, and asked Speed to read it. Speed relates:

The letter was addressed to Mary Todd, and in it he made a plain statement of his feelings, telling her that he had thought the matter over calmly and with great deliberation, and now felt that he did not love her sufficiently to warrant her in marrying him. This letter he desired me to deliver. Upon my declining to do so he threatened to intrust it to some other person's hand. I reminded him that the moment he placed the letter in Miss Todd's hand, she would have the advantage over him. “Words are forgotten,” I said, “misunderstood, unnoticed in a private conversation, but once put your words in writing and they stand a living and eternal monument against you.” Thereupon I threw the unfortunate letter in the fire.

So we shall never know precisely what Lincoln said to her; but “we can form a good idea of what he wrote to Mary Todd,” says Senator Beveridge “by again reading his fnal letter to Miss Owens.”

The story of Lincoln's affair with Miss Owens can be told briefy. It had occurred four years earlier. She was a sister of Mrs. Bennett Abell, whom Lincoln knew in New Salem. In the autumn of 1836 Mrs. Abell returned to Kentucky to visit her family, saying that she would bring her sister back to Illinois with her if Lincoln would agree to marry her.

Lincoln had seen the sister three years before, and he said all right; and presto! the sister appeared. She had a beautiful face, refinement, education, and wealth; but Lincoln didn't want to marry her. He thought “she was a trife too willing.” Besides, she was a year older than he, andshort and very corpulent— “a fair match for Falstaff,” as Lincoln put it.

“I was not at all pleased with her,” said Lincoln, “but what could I do?”

Mrs. Abell “was very anxious,” to have Lincoln stick to his promise.

But he wasn't. He admits he was “continually repenting the rashness” which had led him to make it, and dreaded the thought of marrying her as “an Irishman does the halter.”

So he wrote to Miss Owens, frankly and tactfully telling her how he felt and trying to get out of the engagement.

Here is one of his letters. It was written in Springfeld on May 7, 1837, and I believe it gives us a very good idea of what he wrote to Mary Todd.




Friend Mary,

I have commenced two letters to send you before this, both of which displeased me before I got half done, and so I tore them up. The first I thought wasn't serious enough, and the second was on the other extreme. I shall send this, turn out as it may.

This thing of living in Springfield is rather a dull business after all—at least it is so to me. I am quite as lonesome here as [I] ever was anywhere in my life. I have been spoken to by but one woman since I've been here, and should not have been by her if she could have avoided it. I've never been to church yet, and probably shall not be soon. I stay away because I am conscious I should not know how to behave myself. I am often thinking of what we said of your coming to live at Springfield. I am afraid you would not be satisfied. There is a great deal of flourishing about in carriages here, which it would be your doom to see without sharing in it. You would have to be poor without the means of hiding your poverty. Do you believe you could bear that patiently? Whatever woman may cast her lot with mine, should anyone ever do so, it is my intention to do all in my power to make her happy and contented, and there is nothing I can imagine that would make me more unhappy than to fail in the effort. I know I should be much happier with you than the way I am, provided I saw no signs of discontent in you.

What you have said to me may have been in jest or I may have misunderstood it. If so, then let it be forgotten; if otherwise I much wish you would think seriously before you decide. For my part I have already decided. What I have said I will most positively abide by, provided you wish it. My opinion is you had better not do it. You have not been accustomed to hardship, and it may be more severe than you imagine. I know you are capable of thinking correctly on any subject; and if you deliberate maturely upon this before you decide, then I am willing to abide your decision.

You must write me a good long letter after you get this. You have nothing else to do, and though it might not seem interesting to you after you have written it, it would be a good deal of company in this busy wilderness. Tell your sister I don't want to hear any more about selling out and moving. That gives me the hypo whenever I think of it.

Yours, etc.

Lincoln

So much for Lincoln's affair with Mary Owens. To return to his affair with Mary Todd: Speed tossed into the fre the letter which Lincoln had written to Miss Todd, and, turning to his friend and room-mate, said:

“Now, if you have the courage of manhood, go see Mary yourself; tell her, if you do not love her, the facts, and that you will not marryher. Be careful not to say too much, and then leave at your earliest opportunity.”

“Thus admonished,” Speed relates, “he buttoned his coat, and with a rather determined look started out to perform the serious duty for which I had just given him explicit directions.”

Herndon says:

That night Speed did not go upstairs to bed with us, but under pretense of wanting to read, remained in the store below. He was waiting for Lincoln's return. Ten o'clock passed, and still the interview with Miss Todd had not ended. At length, shortly after eleven, he came stalking in. Speed was satisfied, from the length of Lincoln's stay, that his directions had not been followed.

“Well, old fellow, did you do as I told you and as you promised?” were Speed's first words.

“Yes, I did,” responded Lincoln, thoughtfully, “and when I told Mary I did not love her, she burst into tears and almost springing from her chair and wringing her hands as if in agony, said something about the deceiver being himself deceived.” Then he stopped.

“What else did you say?” inquired Speed, drawing the facts from him.

“To tell you the truth, Speed, it was too much for me. I found the tears trickling down my own cheeks. I caught her in my arms and kissed her.”

“And that's how you broke the engagement,” sneered Speed. “You not only acted the fool, but your conduct was tantamount to a renewal of the engagement, and in decency you cannot back down now.”

“Well,” drawled Lincoln, “if I am in again, so be it. It's done, and I shall abide by it.”

Weeks rolled on, and the marriage date drew near. Seamstresses were at work upon Mary Todd's trousseau. The Edwards mansion was freshly painted, the living-rooms were redecorated, the rugs renovated, and the furniture polished and shifted.

But, in the meantime, a dreadful thing was happening to Abraham Lincoln. One is at a loss to know how to describe it. Profound mental depression is not like grief of the normal type; it is a dangerous illness affecting both mind and body.

Lincoln was sinking day by day, now, into just such a state. His mind came very near being unbalanced; and it is doubtful whether he ever fully recovered from the effects of these awful weeks of unspeakable torture. Although he had defnitely agreed to the marriage, his whole soul rebelled against it. Without realizing it, he was seeking a way of escape. He sat for hours in the room above the store, with no desire to go to his offce or to attend the meetings of the legislature of which he was a member. Sometimes he arose at three o'clock in the morning, went down below, lighted a fre in the freplace, and sat staring at it until daybreak. He ate less, and began to lose weight. He was irritable, avoided people, and would talk to no one.

He had begun now to recoil with horror from his approaching marriage. His mind seemed to be whirling through a dark abyss, and he feared that he was losing his reason. He wrote a long letter to Dr. Daniel Drake of Cincinnati, the most eminent physician in the West, the head of the medical department of the College of Cincinnati, describing his case and asking the physician to recommend a course of treatment. ButDr. Drake replied that it would be impossible for him to do so without a personal examination.

The marriage was set for January 1, 1841. The day dawned bright and clear, and the aristocracy of Springfeld fourished about in sleighs, making their New Year's calls. Out of nostrils of horses issued breaths of steam, and the tinkle of tiny bells flled the air.

At the Edwards mansion the bustle and hurry of final preparation went on apace. Delivery boys hastened to the back door with this article and that that had been ordered at the last minute. A special chef had been hired for the occasion. The dinner was to be cooked, not in an old iron oven on the hearth, but in a new invention that had just been installed—a cooking stove.

The early evening of New Year's Day descended on the town, candles glowed softly, holly wreaths hung in the windows. The Edwards house was hushed with excitement, vibrant with expectation. At six-thirty happy guests began to arrive. At six forty-fve came the minister, the ritual of the Church under his arm. The rooms were banked with plants, colorful with flowers. Huge fires crackled and blazed on the hearths. The place resounded with pleasant and friendly chatter.

The clock struck seven.... Seven-thirty. Lincoln had not arrived.... He was late.

Minutes passed.... Slowly, inexorably, the grandfather's clock in the hallway ticked off a quarter of an hour. Half an hour.... Still there was no bridegroom. Going to the front door, Mrs. Edwards stared nervously down the driveway. What was wrong? Could he...? No! Unthinkable! Impossible!

The family withdrew.... Whisperings.... A hurried consultation.

In the next room, Mary Todd, bedecked with bridal veil, attired in silken gown, waited... waited... nervously toying with the fowers in herhair. She walked to the window constantly. She peered down the street. She couldn't keep her eyes off the clock. The palms of her hands grew wet, perspiration gathered on her brow. Another awful hour passed. He had promised... Surely...

At nine-thirty, one by one, the guests withdrew, softly, wonderingly, and with embarrassment.

When the last one had disappeared the bride-to-be tore her veil from her head, snatched the fowers from her hair, rushed sobbing up the stairway, and fung herself on the bed. She was rent with grief. Oh, God! what would people say? She would be laughed at. Pitied. Disgraced. Ashamed to walk the streets. Great waves of bitterness, of violence, swept over her. One moment, she longed to have Lincoln there to take her in his arms. The next, she longed to kill him for the hurt, for the humiliation, he had heaped upon her.

Where was Lincoln? Had he met with foul play? Had there been an accident? Had he run away? Had he committed suicide? No one knew.

At midnight men came with lanterns, and searching parties set out. Some explored his favorite haunts in town, others searched the roads leading out into the country.

The search continued all through the night, and shortly after daybreak Lincoln was found sitting in his offce, talking incoherently. His friends feared he was losing his mind. Mary Todd's relatives declared that he was already insane. That was the way they explained his failure to show up at the wedding.

Dr. Henry was called immediately. Lincoln threatened to commit suicide, so the doctor ordered Speed and Butler to watch over himconstantly. His knife was taken from him now and kept from him just as it had been after the death of Ann Rutledge.

Dr. Henry, wanting to keep his mind occupied, urged Lincoln to attend the sessions of the State Legislature. As the floor leader for the Whigs, he ought to have been there constantly. But the records show that he was present but four times in three weeks—and even then only for an hour or two. On January 19 John J. Hardin announced his illness to the House.

Three weeks after he had fed from his wedding Lincoln wrote to his law partner the saddest letter of his life:

I am now the most miserable man living. If what I feel were equally distributed to the whole human family, there would not be one cheerful face on earth. Whether I shall ever be any better, I cannot tell. I awfully forbode that I shall not. To remain as I am is impossible. I must die or be better, it seems to me.

As the late Dr. William E. Barton says in his well-known biography of Lincoln, this letter “can mean nothing else than that Abraham Lincoln was mentally distraught... that he had grave fears for his own sanity.”

He thought constantly of death, now, and longed for it and wrote a poem on suicide and had it published in the “Sangamo Journal.”

Speed feared that he was going to die; so Lincoln was taken to the home of Speed's mother, near Louisville. Here he was given a Bible and assigned a quiet bedroom looking out over a brook meandering through meadows to the forest a mile away. Each morning a slave brought Lincoln his coffee in bed.

Mrs. Edwards, Mary's sister, says that Mary, “to set herself right and to free Mr. Lincoln's mind, wrote a letter to Mr. Lincoln, stating that shewould release him from his engagement.”

But in releasing him, according to Mr. Edwards, “she left Lincoln the privilege of renewing it if he wished.” But that was the last thing in the world that he wished. He never wanted to see her again. Even a year after Lincoln had fed from his wedding, his good friend James Matheny “thought Lincoln would commit suicide.”

For almost two years after the “fatal frst of January,” 1841, Lincoln ignored Mary Todd completely, hoping that she would forget him, praying that she would interest herself in some other man. But she did not, for her pride was at stake, her precious self-respect. She was determined to prove to herself and to those who had scorned and pitied her that she could and would marry Abraham Lincoln.

And he was equally determined not to marry her.

In fact, he was so determined that he proposed within a year to another girl. He was thirty-two at the time, the girl he proposed to was half that age. She was Sarah Rickard, the little sister of Mrs. Butler, at whose house Lincoln had been boarding for four years.

Lincoln pleaded his case with her, arguing that since his name was Abraham and hers Sarah it was evident that they were meant for one another.

But she refused him, because, as she later confessed in writing to a friend:

I was young, only sixteen years old and I had not thought much about matrimony.... I airway liked him as a friend but you Know his peculiar manner and his General deportment would not be likely to fascinate a Young Girl just entering into the society world.... He seemed allmost like an older Brother being as it were one of my sister's family.

Lincoln frequently wrote editorials for the local Whig paper, “The Springfield Journal;” and the editor, Simeon Francis, was one of his closest friends. Francis's wife, unfortunately, had never learned the fne art of minding her own business. Childless, over forty, she was the self-appointed match-maker of Springfeld.

Early in October, 1842, she wrote Lincoln, asking him to call at her home the following afternoon. That was a strange request, and he went, wondering what it could mean. When he arrived, he was ushered into the parlor; and there, to his astonishment, he saw Mary Todd sitting before him.

What Lincoln and Mary Todd said, and how they said it, and what they did, that is not recorded. But of course the poor, tender-hearted fellow hadn't a chance to escape. If she cried—and of course she did—he probably delivered himself into her hands at once, and abjectly apologized for having gotten out of her hands.

They met often after that, but always secretly and behind closed doors in the Francis home.

At frst Mary didn't let even her sister know that Lincoln was seeing her again.

Finally, when her sister did fnd out, she asked Mary “why she was so secretive.”

And Mary replied “evasively that after all that had occurred, it was best to keep the courtship from all eyes and ears. Men and women of the world were uncertain and slippery, Mary continued, and if misfortune befell the engagement, all knowledge of it would be hidden from the world.”

In other words, to put it bluntly, having learned a little lesson, she resolved to keep even the courtship secret, this time, until she was positive that Lincoln would marry her.

What technique did Miss Todd now employ?

James Matheny declared that Lincoln often told him “that he was driven into the marriage, and that Miss Todd told him he was in honor bound to marry her.”

Herndon ought to have known if anybody did, and he said:

To me it has always seemed plain that Mr. Lincoln married Mary Todd to save his honor, and in doing that he sacrificed his domestic peace. He had searched himself subjectively, introspectively, thoroughly: he knew he did not love her, but he had promised to marry her. The hideous thought came up like a nightmare.... At last he stood face to face with the great conflict between honor and domestic peace. He chose the former, and with it years of self-torture, sacrificial pangs, and the loss forever of a happy home.

Before he was willing to proceed, he wrote Speed, who had gone back to Kentucky, asking him if he had found happiness in his marriage.

“Please answer quickly,” Lincoln urged, “as I am impatient to know.”

Speed replied that he was far happier than he had ever expected to be.

So the next afternoon, Friday, November 4, 1842, Lincoln, reluctantly and with an aching heart, asked Mary Todd to be his wife.

She wanted to have the ceremony performed that very night. He hesitated, surprised, and a little frightened at the celerity with which events were moving. Knowing she was superstitious, he pointed out that the day was Friday. But, remembering what had happened before, she feared nothing now so much as delay. She was unwilling to wait even twenty-four hours. Besides, it was her birthday, her twenty-fourth birthday, so they hurried to Chatterton's jewelry store, bought a wedding-ring, and had these words engraved inside it: “Love is eternal.”

Late that afternoon Lincoln asked James Matheny to be his best man, saying, “Jim, I shall have to marry that girl.”

While Lincoln was putting on his best clothes that evening at Butler's house, and blacking his boots, Butler's little boy rushed in and asked him where he was going.

Lincoln replied: “To hell, I suppose.”

In despair, Mary Todd had given away the trousseau that she had had made for the frst wedding date, so that now she had to be married in a simple white muslin dress. All arrangements were carried through with nervous haste.

Mrs. Edwards says she had only two hours' notice of the marriage and that the frosting on the wedding-cake which she hurriedly baked for the occasion was too warm to cut well when it was served.

As the Rev. Charles Dresser, clad in his clerical vestments, read the impressive Episcopal service, Lincoln seemed far from cheerful and happy. His best man testifed that he “looked and acted as if he were going to the slaughter.”

The only comment that Lincoln ever made in writing about his marriage was a postscript to a business letter that he wrote to Samuel Marshall about a week after the event. This letter is now in the possession of the Chicago Historical Society.

“Nothing new here,” writes Lincoln, “except my marriage which to me is a matter of profound wonder.”





PART TWO


9


While I was writing this book, out in New Salem, Illinois, my good friend Henry Pond, a local attorney, said to me a number of times:

“You ought to go and see Uncle Jimmy Miles, for one of his uncles, Herndon, was Lincoln's law partner, and one of his aunts ran a boarding-house where Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln lived for a while.”

That sounded like an interesting lead; so Mr. Pond and I climbed into his car one Sunday afternoon in July, and drove out to the Miles farm near New Salem—a farm where Lincoln used to stop and swap stories for a drink of cider while walking to Springfeld to borrow law-books.

When we arrived, Uncle Jimmy dragged a trio of rockingchairs out into the shade of a huge maple tree in the front yard; and there, while young turkeys and little ducks ran noisily through the grass about us, we talked for hours; and Uncle Jimmy related an illuminating and pathetic incident about Lincoln that has never been put into print heretofore. The story is this:

Mr. Miles's Aunt Catherine married a physician named Jacob M. Early. About a year after Lincoln arrived in Springfeld—during the night of March 11, 1838, to be exact—an unknown man on horseback rode up to Dr. Early's house, knocked, called the physician to the door, emptiedboth barrels of a shot-gun into his body, then leaped upon a horse and dashed away.

Small as Springfeld was at the time, no one was ever charged with the murder, and the killing remains a mystery to this day.

Dr. Early left a very small estate; so his widow was obliged to take in boarders to support herself; and, shortly after their marriage, Mr. and Mrs. Abraham Lincoln came to Mrs. Early's home to live.

Uncle Jimmy Miles told me that he had often heard his aunt, Dr. Early's widow, relate the following incident: One morning Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln were having breakfast when Lincoln did something that aroused the fiery temper of his wife. What, no one remembers now. But Mrs. Lincoln, in a rage, dashed a cup of hot coffee into her husband's face. And she did it in front of the other boarders.

Saying nothing, Lincoln sat there in humiliation and silence while Mrs. Early came with a wet towel and wiped off his face and clothes. That incident was probably typical of the married life of the Lincolns for the next quarter of a century.

Springfeld had eleven attorneys, and they couldn't all make a living there; so they used to ride horseback from one countyseat to another, following Judge David Davis while he was holding court in the various places throughout the Eighth Judicial District. The other attorneys always managed to get back to Springfeld each Saturday and spend the week-end with their families.

But Lincoln didn't. He dreaded to go home, and for three months in the spring, and again for three months in the autumn, he remained out on the circuit and never went near Springfeld.

He kept this up year after year. Living conditions in the country hotels were often wretched; but wretched as they were, he preferred them to his own home and Mrs. Lincoln's constant nagging and wild outburstsof temper. “She vexed and harassed the soul out of him—” that was what the neighbors said; and the neighbors knew, for they saw her, and they couldn't help hearing her.

Mrs. Lincoln's “loud shrill voice,” says Senator Beveridge, “could be heard across the street, and her incessant outbursts of wrath were audible to all who lived near the house. Frequently her anger was displayed by other means than words, and accounts of her violence are numerous and unimpeachable.”

“She led her husband a wild and merry dance,” says Herndon.

And Herndon felt he knew why “she unchained the bitterness of a disappointed and outraged nature.”

It was her desire for vengeance. “He had crushed her proud womanly spirit,” suggests Herndon, and “she felt degraded in the eyes of the world: Love fed at the approach of revenge.”

She was always complaining, always criticizing her husband; nothing about him was ever right: He was stoopshouldered, he walked awkwardly and lifted his feet straight up and down like an Indian. She complained that there was no spring to his step, no grace to his movements; and she mimicked his gait and nagged at him to walk with his toes pointed down, as she had been taught at Madame Mentelle's.

She didn't like the way his huge ears stood out at right angles from his head. She even told him that his nose wasn't straight, that his lower lip stuck out, that he looked consumptive, that his feet and hands were too large, his head too small.

His shocking indifference to his personal appearance grated on her sensitive nature, and made her woefully unhappy. “Mrs. Lincoln,” says Herndon, “was not a wildcat without cause.” Sometimes her husband walked down the street with one trouser leg stuffed inside his boot-top and the other dangling on the outside. His boots were seldom blackenedor greased. His collar often needed changing, his coat frequently needed brushing.

James Gourly, who lived next door to the Lincolns for years, wrote: “Mr. Lincoln used to come to our house, his feet encased in a pair of loose slippers, and with an old faded pair of trousers fastened with one suspender—” or “gallis” as Lincoln himself called it.

In warm weather he made extended trips “wearing a dirty linen duster for a coat, on the back of which the perspiration had splotched wide stains that resembled a map of the continent.”

A young lawyer who once saw Lincoln in a country hotel, getting ready for bed, and clad “in a home made yellow fannel night shirt” that reached “halfway between his knees and his ankles,” exclaimed, “He was the ungodliest fgure I ever saw.”

He never owned a razor in his life, and he didn't visit a barber as frequently as Mrs. Lincoln thought he should.

He neglected to groom his coarse, bushy hair, that stood out all over his head like horsehair. That irritated Mary Todd beyond words, and when she combed it, it was soon mussed again, by his bank-book, letters, and legal papers, which he carried in the top of his hat.

One day he was having his picture taken in Chicago, and the photographer urged him to “slick up” a bit. He replied that “a portrait of a slicked-up Lincoln wouldn't be recognized down in Springfeld.”

His table manners were large and free. He didn't hold his knife right, and he didn't even lay it on his plate right. He had no skill whatever in the art of eating fsh with a fork and a crust of bread. Sometimes he tilted the meat platter and raked or slid a pork chop off onto his plate. Mrs. Lincoln raised “merry war” with him because he persisted in using his own knife for the butter; and once when he put chicken bones on the side dish on which his lettuce had been served, she almost fainted.

She complained and scolded because he didn't stand up when ladies came into the room; because he didn't jump around to take their wraps, and didn't see callers to the door when they left.

He loved to read lying down. As soon as he came home from the offce, he took off his coat and shoes and collar and dropped his one “gallis” from his shoulder, turned a chair upside down in the hallway, padded its sloping back with a pillow, propped his head and shoulders against it, and stretched out on the foor.

In that position he would lie and read for hours—usually the newspapers. Sometimes he read what he considered a very humorous story about an earthquake, from a book entitled “Flush Times in Alabama.” Often, very often, he read poetry. And whatever he read, he read aloud. He had gotten the habit from the “blab” schools back in Indiana. He also felt that by reading aloud he could impress a thing on his sense of hearing as well as his sense of sight, and so remember it longer.

Sometimes he would lie on the floor and close his eyes and quote Shakspere or Byron or Poe; for example:

For the moon never beams without bringing me dreams

Of the beautiful Annabel Lee,

And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes

Of the beautiful Annabel Lee.

A lady—a relative—who lived with the Lincolns two years says that one evening Lincoln was lying down in the hall, reading, when company came. Without waiting for the servant to answer the door, he got up in his shirtsleeves, ushered the callers into the parlor, and said he would “trot the women folks out.”

Mrs. Lincoln from an adjoining room witnessed the ladies' entrance, and overheard her husband's jocose expression. Her indignation was so instantaneous she made the situation exceedingly interesting for him, and he was glad to retreat from the mansion. He did not return until very late at night, and then slipped quietly in at a rear door.

Mrs. Lincoln was violently jealous, and she had little use for Joshua Speed. He had been her husband's intimate friend, and she suspected that he might have infuenced Lincoln to run away from his wedding. Before his marriage, Lincoln had been in the habit of ending his letters to Speed with “Love to Fanny.” But, after the marriage, Mrs. Lincoln demanded that that greeting be tempered down to “Regards to Mrs. Speed.”

Lincoln never forgot a favor. That was one of his outstanding characteristics; so, as a little gesture of appreciation, he had promised that the frst boy would be named Joshua Speed Lincoln. But when Mary Todd heard it she burst out in a storm. It was her child, and she was going to name it! And, what was more, the name was not going to be Joshua Speed! It was going to be Robert Todd, after her own father... and so on and so on.

It is hardly necessary to add that the boy was named Robert Todd. He was the only one of the four Lincoln children to reach maturity. Eddie died in 1850 at Springfeld—age 4. Willie died in the White House—age 12. Tad died in Chicago in 1871—age 18. Robert Todd Lincoln died in Manchester, Vermont, July 26, 1926—age 83.

Mrs. Lincoln complained because the yard was without flowers, shrubs, or color. So Lincoln set out a few roses, but he took no interest in them and they soon perished of neglect. She urged him to plant a garden, and one spring he did, but the weeds overran it.

Though he was not much given to physical exertion, he did feed and curry “Old Buck” ; he also “fed and milked his own cow and sawed his own wood.” And he continued to do this, even after he was electedPresident, until he left Springfeld.

However, John Hanks, Lincoln's second cousin, once remarked that “Abe was not good at any kind of work except dreamin'.” And Mary Lincoln agreed with him.

Lincoln was absent-minded, often sank into curious spells of abstraction, and appeared to be entirely oblivious of the earth and everything that was on it. On Sundays, he would put one of his babies into a little wagon and haul the child up and down the rough sidewalk in front of his house. Sometimes the little chap happened to roll overboard. But Lincoln pulled steadily ahead, his eyes fxed on the ground, unconscious of the loud lamentations behind him. He never knew what had happened until Mrs. Lincoln thrust her head out at the door and yelled at him in a shrill, angry voice.

Sometimes he came into the house after a day at the office and looked at her and apparently didn't see her and didn't even speak. He was seldom interested in food; after she had prepared a meal, she frequently had hard work to get him into the dining-room. She called, but he seemed not to hear. He would sit down at the table and stare off dreamily into space, and forget to eat until she reminded him of it.

After dinner he sometimes stared into the freplace for half an hour at a time, saying nothing. The boys literally crawled all over him and pulled his hair and talked to him, but he seemed unconscious of their existence. Then suddenly he would come to and tell a joke or recite one of his favorite verses:

Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?

Like a swift-fleeting meteor, a fast-flying cloud,

A flash of the lightning, a break of the wave,

He passes from life to his rest in the grave.

Mrs. Lincoln criticized him for never correcting the children. But he so adored them that “he was blind and deaf to their faults.” “He never neglected to praise them for any of their good acts,” said Mrs. Lincoln, “and declared: It is my pleasure that my children are free and happy, and unrestrained by parental tyranny. Love is the chain whereby to bind a child to its parents.”

The liberties he allowed his children at times appear extraordinary. For example, once when he was playing chess with a judge of the Supreme Court, Robert came and told his father it was time to go to dinner. Lincoln replied, “Yes, yes.” But, being very fond of the game, he quite forgot that he had been called, and played on.

Again the boy appeared, with another urgent message from Mrs. Lincoln. Again Lincoln promised to come, again he forgot.

A third time Robert arrived with a summons, a third time Lincoln promised, and a third time he played on. Then, suddenly, the boy drew back and violently kicked the chess-board higher than the players' heads, scattering the chessmen in every direction.

“Well, Judge,” Lincoln said with a smile, “I reckon we'll have to fnish this game some other time.”

Lincoln apparently never even thought of correcting his son.

The Lincoln boys used to hide behind a hedge in the evening and stick a lath through the fence. As there were no street lights, passers-by would run into the lath and their hats would be knocked off. Once, in the darkness, the boys knocked off their father's hat by mistake. He didn't censure them, but merely told them that they ought to be careful, for they might make somebody mad.

Lincoln did not belong to any church, and avoided religious discussions even with his best friends. However, he once told Herndonthat his religious code was like that of an old man named Glenn, in Indiana, whom he had heard speak at a church meeting, and who said: “When I do good, I feel good, when I do bad I feel bad, and that's my religion.”

On Sunday mornings, as the children grew older, he usually took them out for a stroll, but once he left them at home and went to the First Presbyterian Church with Mrs. Lincoln. Half an hour later Tad came into the house and, missing his father, ran down the street and dashed into the church during the sermon. His hair was awry, his shoes unbuttoned, his stockings sagging down, and his face and hands were grimy with the black soil of Illinois. Mrs. Lincoln, herself elegantly attired, was shocked and embarrassed; but Lincoln calmly stretched out one of his long arms and lovingly drew Tad to him and held the boy's head close against his breast.

Sometimes on Sunday morning, Lincoln took the boys downtown to his offce. There they were permitted to run wild. “They soon gutted the shelves of books,” says Herndon, “rifed the drawers and riddled boxes, battered the point of my gold pen... threw the pencils into the spittoon, turned over the inkstands on the papers, scattered letters over the offce and danced on them.”

And Lincoln “never reproved them or gave them a fatherly frown. He was the most indulgent parent I have ever known,” Herndon concludes.

Mrs. Lincoln seldom went to the offce; but when she did, she was shocked. She had reason to be: the place had no order, no system, things were piled about everywhere. Lincoln tied up one bundle of papers and labeled it thus: “When you can't fnd it anywhere else, look in here.”

As speed said, Lincoln's habits were “regularly irregular.”

On one wall loomed a huge black stain, marking the place where one law student had hurled an inkstand at another one's head—and missed.

The office was seldom swept and almost never scrubbed. Some garden seeds that were lying on top of the bookcase had started to sprout and grow there, in the dust and dirt.

In most respects, there wasn't a more economical housewife in all Springfield than Mary Lincoln. She was extravagant chiefly in matters having to do with showing off. She bought a carriage when the Lincolns could ill afford it and paid a neighbor's boy twenty-fve cents an afternoon for driving her about town to make social calls. The place was a mere village, and she could have walked or hired a vehicle. But no, that would have been beneath her. And no matter how poor they were, she could always fnd money for clothes costing more than she could afford.

In 1844, the Lincolns paid ffteen hundred dollars for the home of the Rev. Charles Dresser who, two years before, had performed their marriage ceremony. The house had a livingroom, kitchen, parlor, bedrooms; and, in the back yard, there was a woodpile, an outhouse, and a barn where Lincoln kept his cow and Old Buck.

At frst the place seemed to Mary Lincoln an earthly paradise; and it was, in comparison with the bleak, bare rooms of the boarding-house she had just left. Besides, she had the new-found joy and pride of ownership. But its perfections soon began to fade, and she was forever fnding fault with the home. Her sister lived in a huge two-story house, and this one was only a story and a half high. She once told Lincoln that no man who ever amounted to much lived in a story-and-a-half house.

Usually, when she asked him for anything, he never inquired whether it was necessary. “You know what you want,” he would say, “so go and get it.” But in this instance, he rebelled: the family was small, and thehouse was entirely adequate. Besides, he was a poor man: he had only fve hundred dollars when they were married, and he had not added much to it since. He knew that they couldn't afford to enlarge the house; and she knew it also; but she kept on urging and complaining. Finally, in order to quiet her, he had a contractor estimate the cost, and Lincoln told him to make it high. He did, and Lincoln showed her the fgures. She gasped, and he imagined that settled the matter.

But he was too hopeful, for the next time he went away on the circuit she called in another carpenter, got a lower estimate, and ordered the work done at once.

When Lincoln returned to Springfeld and walked down Eighth Street, he hardly recognized his own house. Meeting a friend, he inquired with mock seriousness, “Stranger, can you tell me where Mr. Lincoln lives?”

His income from the law was not large; and he often had, as he put it, “hard scratching” to meet his bills. And now he had come home to fnd a large and unnecessary carpenter bill added to his burdens.

It saddened him, and he said so.

Mrs. Lincoln answered him in the only way that she knew how to react to a criticism—with an attack. She told him testily that he had no money sense, that he didn't know how to manage, that he didn't charge enough for his services.

That was one of her favorite grievances, and many people would have backed her stand on that. The other attorneys were constantly irritated and annoyed by Lincoln's trifing charges, declaring that he was impoverishing the whole bar.

As late as 1853, when Lincoln was forty-four years old and only eight years away from the White House, he handled four cases in the McLean Circuit Court for a total charge of thirty dollars.

Many of his clients, he said, were as poor as he, and he didn't havethe heart to charge them much.

Once a man sent him twenty-fve dollars; and Lincoln returned ten, saying he had been too liberal.

In another instance, he prevented a swindler from getting hold of ten thousand dollars' worth of property owned by a demented girl. Lincoln won the case in ffteen minutes. An hour later, his associate, Ward Lamon, came to divide their fee of two hundred and ffty dollars. Lincoln rebuked him sternly. Lamon protested that the fee had been settled in advance, that the girl's brother was entirely satisfed to pay it.

“That may be,” Lincoln retorted, “but I am not satisfed. That money comes out of the pocket of a poor, demented girl; and I would rather starve than swindle her in this manner. You return half this money at least, or I'll not take a cent of it as my share.”

In another instance, a pension agent had charged the widow of a Revolutionary soldier half the four hundred dollars to which her pension amounted, for getting her claim allowed. The old woman was bent with age, and in poverty. Lincoln had her sue the pension agent, won the case for her, and charged her nothing. Besides, he paid her hotel bill and gave her money to buy a ticket home.

One day the Widow Armstrong came to Lincoln in great trouble. Her son Duff was charged with having murdered a man in a drunken brawl, and she pleaded with Abe to come and save the boy. Lincoln had known the Armstrongs back in New Salem. In fact, he had rocked Duff to sleep when he was a baby in the cradle. The Armstrongs had been a wild, rough lot; but Lincoln liked them. Jack Armstrong, Duff's father, had been the leader of the Clary's Grove Boys, and the renowned athlete whom Lincoln vanquished in a wrestling-match that has gone down in history.

Old Jack was dead now. Lincoln gladly went before the jury and made one of the most moving and appealing addresses of his career, andsaved the boy from the gallows.

All the widowed mother had in the world was forty acres of land, which she offered to turn over to Lincoln.

“Aunt Hannah,” he said, “you took me in years ago when I was poor and homeless, and you fed me and mended my clothes, and I shan't charge you a cent now.”

Sometimes he urged his clients to settle out of court, and charged them nothing whatever for his advice. In one instance, he refused to take a judgment against a man, saying, “I am really sorry for him—poor and a cripple as he is.”

Such kindness and consideration, beautiful though it was, didn't bring in cash; so Mary Lincoln scolded and fretted. Her husband wasn't getting on in the world, while other lawyers were growing wealthy with their fees and investments. Judge David Davis, for example, and Logan. Yes, and Stephen A. Douglas. By investing in Chicago real estate, Douglas had amassed a fortune and even become a philanthropist, giving Chicago University ten acres of valuable land upon which to erect its buildings. Besides, he was now one of the most famous political leaders in the nation.

How often Mary Lincoln thought of him, and how keenly she wished she had married him! As Mrs. Douglas she would be a social leader in Washington, wear Paris clothes, enjoy trips to Europe, dine with queens, and some day live in the White House. So she probably pictured herself in vain day-dreams.

What was her future as Lincoln's wife? He would go on like this to the end: riding the circuit for six months out of the year, leaving her alone at home, lavishing no love on her, and giving her no attention.... How different, how poignantly different, the realities of life were from the romantic visions she had once dreamed at Madame Mentelle's in the long ago!

In most respects, as has been said, Mrs. Lincoln was economical, and took pride in the fact. She purchased supplies carefully and the table was set sparingly, very sparingly; there were just barely enough scraps left to feed the cats. The Lincolns had no dog.

She bought bottle after bottle of perfume, broke the seals, sampled them, and returned them, contending that they were inferior, that they had been misrepresented. She did this so often that the local druggist refused to honor her orders for more. His account-book may still be seen in Springfield with the penciled notations: “Perfume returned by Mrs. Lincoln.”

She frequently had trouble with the tradespeople. For example, she felt that Myers, the iceman, was cheating her with short weights; so she turned on him and berated him in such a shrill, loud voice that neighbors half a block away ran to their doors to look and listen.

This was the second time she had made this accusation, and he swore that he would see her sizzling in hell before he would sell her another piece of ice.

He meant it, and he stopped his deliveries. That was awkward. She had to have ice, and he was the only man in town who supplied it; so, for once in her life, Mary Lincoln humbled herself. But she didn't do it personally: she paid a neighbor a quarter to go downtown and salve over the wound and coax Myers to resume his deliveries.

One of Lincoln's friends started a little newspaper called “The Springfeld Republican.” He canvassed the town, and Lincoln subscribed for it. When the frst copy was delivered at the door, Mary Todd was enraged. What! Another worthless paper? More money thrown away when she was trying so hard to save every penny! She lectured and scolded; and, in orderto pacify her, Lincoln said that he had not ordered the paper to be delivered. That was literally true. He had merely said he would pay for a subscription. He hadn't specifcally said he wanted it delivered. A lawyer's fnesse!

That evening, unknown to her husband, Mary Todd wrote a fiery letter, telling the editor what she thought of his paper, and demanding that it be discontinued.

She was so insulting that the editor answered her publicly in a column of the paper, and then wrote Lincoln, demanding an explanation. Lincoln was so distressed by the publicity that he was positively ill. In humiliation, he wrote the editor, saying it was all a mistake, trying to explain as best he could.

Once Lincoln wanted to invite his stepmother to spend Christmas at his home, but Mary Todd objected. She despised the old folks, and held Tom Lincoln and the Hanks tribe in profound contempt. She was ashamed of them, and Lincoln feared that even if they came to the house she wouldn't admit them. For twenty-three years his stepmother lived seventy miles away from Springfeld, and he went to visit her, but she never saw the inside of his home.

The only relative of his that ever visited him after his marriage was a distant cousin, Harriet Hanks, a sensible girl with a pleasing disposition. Lincoln was very fond of her and invited her to live at his home while she attended school in Springfeld. Mrs. Lincoln not only made a servant of her but tried to turn her into a veritable household drudge. Lincoln rebelled at this, refused to countenance such rank injustice, and the whole thing resulted in a distressing scene.

She had incessant trouble with her “hired girls.” One or two explosions of her fery wrath, and they packed up and left, an unending stream of them. They despised her and warned their friends; so the Lincoln home was soon on the maids' black-list.

She fumed and fussed and wrote letters about the “wild Irish” she had to employ. But all Irish became “wild” when they tried to work for her. She openly boasted that if she outlived her husband, she would spend the rest of her days in a Southern State. The people with whom she had been brought up, back in Lexington, did not put up with any impudence from their servants. If a Negro did not mind, he was sent forthwith to the whipping-post in the public square, to be fogged. One of the Todds' neighbors fogged six of his Negroes until they died.

“Long Jake” was a well-known character in Springfeld at that time. He had a span of mules and an old dilapidated wagon, and he ran what he vaingloriously described as an “express service.” His niece, unfortunately, went to work for Mrs. Lincoln. A few days later, the servant and mistress quarreled; the girl threw off her apron, packed her trunk, and walked out of the house, slamming the door behind her.

That afternoon, Long Jake drove his mules down to the corner of Eighth and Jackson streets and told Mrs. Lincoln that he had come for his niece's baggage. Mrs. Lincoln few into a rage, abused him and his niece in bitter language, and threatened to strike him if he entered her house. Indignant, he rushed down to Lincoln's offce and demanded that the poor man make his wife apologize.

Lincoln listened to his story, and then said sadly:

“I regret to hear this, but let me ask you in all candor, can't you endure for a few moments what I have had as my daily portion for the last ffteen years?”

The interview ended in Long Jake's extending his sympathy to Lincoln and apologizing for having troubled him.

Once Mrs. Lincoln kept a maid for more than two years, and the neighbors marveled; they could not understand it. The explanation was very simple: Lincoln had made a secret bargain with this one. When she firstcame, he took her aside and told her very frankly what she would have to endure; that he was sorry, but it couldn't be helped. The girl must ignore it. Lincoln promised her an extra dollar a week, himself, if she would do so.

The outbursts went on as usual; but with her secret moral and monetary backing, Maria persisted. After Mrs. Lincoln had given her a tongue-lashing, Lincoln would watch his chance and steal out into the kitchen while the maid was alone and pat her on the shoulder, admonishing her:

“That's right. Keep up your courage, Maria. Stay with her. Stay with her.”

This servant afterward married, and her husband fought under Grant. When Lee surrendered, Maria hurried to Washington to obtain her husband's immediate release, for she and her children were in want. Lincoln was glad to see her, and sat down and talked to her about old times. He wanted to invite her to stay for dinner, but Mary Todd wouldn't hear of it. He gave her a basket of fruit and money to buy clothes, and told her to call again the next day and he would provide her with a pass through the lines. But she didn't call, for that night he was assassinated.

And so Mrs. Lincoln stormed on through the years, leaving in her wake a train of heartaches and hatred. At times she behaved as if insane.

There was something a trifle queer about the Todd family; and since Mary's parents were cousins, perhaps this queer streak had been accentuated by inbreeding. Some people—among others, her own physician—feared she was suffering from an incipient mental disease.

Lincoln bore it all with Christ-like patience, and seldom censured her. But his friends weren't so docile.

Herndon denounced her as a “wildcat” and a “she wolf.”

Turner King, one of Lincoln's warmest admirers, described her as “a hellion, a she devil,” and declared that he had seen her drive Lincoln outof the house time after time.

John Hay, as secretary to the President in Washington, called her a short, ugly name that it is best not to print.

The pastor of the Methodist Church in Springfield lived near the Lincoln house. He and Lincoln were friends; and his wife testifed that the Lincolns “were very unhappy in their domestic life, and that Mrs. Lincoln was seen frequently to drive him from the house with a broomstick.”

James Gourley, who lived next door for sixteen years, declared that Mrs. Lincoln “had the devil in her,” that she had hallucinations and carried on like a crazy woman, weeping and wailing until she could be heard all over the neighborhood, demanding that some one guard the premises, swearing that some rough character was going to attack her.

Her outbursts of wrath grew more frequent, more fiery, with the passing of time. Lincoln's friends felt deeply sorry for him. He had no home life, and he never invited even his most intimate companions to dine with him—not even men like Herndon and Judge Davis. He was afraid of what might happen. He himself avoided Mary as much as possible, spending his evenings spinning yarns with the other attorneys down at the law library or telling stories to a crowd of men in Diller's drugstore.

Sometimes he was seen wandering alone, late at night, through unfrequented streets, his head on his chest, gloomy and funereal. Sometimes he said, “I hate to go home.” A friend, knowing what was wrong, would take him to his house for the night.

No one knew more than Herndon about the tragic home life of the Lincolns; and this is what Herndon had to say on pages 430—434 of the third volume of his Lincoln biography:

Mr. Lincoln never had a confidant, and therefore never unbosomed himself to others. He never spoke of his trials to me or, so far as I knew, to any of his friends. It was a great burden to carry, but he bore it sadly enough and without a murmur. I could always realize when he was in distress, without being told. He was not exactly an early riser, that is, he never usually appeared at the office till about nine o'clock in the morning. I usually preceded him an hour. Sometimes, however, he would come down as early as seven o'clock—in fact, on one occasion I remember he came down before daylight. If, on arriving at the office, I found him in, I knew instantly that a breeze had sprung up over the domestic sea, and that the waters were troubled. He would either be lying on the lounge looking skyward, or doubled up in a chair with his feet resting on the sill of a back window. He would not look up on my entering, and only answered my “Good morning” with a grunt. I at once busied myself with pen and paper, or ran through the leaves of some book; but the evidence of his melancholy and distress was so plain, and his silence so significant, that I would grow restless myself, and finding some excuse to go to the court-house or elsewhere, would leave the room.

The door of the office opening into a narrow hallway was half glass, with a curtain on it working on brass rings strung on wire. As I passed out on these occasions I would draw the curtain across the glass, and before I reached the bottom of the stairs I could hear the key turn in the lock, and Lincoln was alone in his gloom. An hour in the clerk's office at the court-house, an hour longer in a neighboring store having passed, I would return. By that time either a client had dropped in and Lincoln was propounding the law, or else the cloud of despondency had passed away, and he was busy in the recital of an Indiana story to whistle off the recollections of the morning's gloom. Noon having arrived I would depart homeward for my dinner. Returning within an hour, I would find him still in the office, although his home stood but a few squares away, —lunching on a slice of cheese and a handful of crackers which, in my absence, he had brought up from a store below. Separating for the day at five or six o'clock in the evening, I would still leave him behind, either sitting on a box at the foot of the stairway, entertaining a few loungers, or killing time in the same way on the court-house steps. A light in the office after dark attested his presence there till late along in the night, when, after all the world had gone to sleep, the tall form of the man destined to be the nation's President could have seen strolling along in the shadows of trees and buildings, and quietly slipping in through the door of a modest frame house, which it pleased the world, in a conventional way, to call his home.

Some persons may insist that this picture is too highly colored. If so, I can only answer, they do not know the facts.

Once Mrs. Lincoln attacked her husband so savagely, and kept it up so long, that even he— “with malice toward none; with charity for all” —even he lost his self-control, and seizing her by the arm, he forced her across the kitchen and pushed her toward the door, saying: “You're ruining my life. You're making a hell of this home. Now, damn you, you get out of it.”

If Lincoln had married Ann Rutledge, in all probability he would havebeen happy, but he would not have been President. He was slow in thought and movement, and she was not the type that would have driven him to achieve political distinction. But Mary Todd, obsessed with an undying determination to live in the White House, was no sooner married to Lincoln than she had him out running for the Whig nomination for Congress.

The battle was a ferce one; and, incredible as it seems, his political enemies accused him of being an infdel because he belonged to no church, and denounced him as a tool of wealth and aristocracy because he had affiliated himself through marriage with the haughty Todd and Edwards families. Ridiculous as the charges were, Lincoln realized that they might hurt him politically. So he answered his critics: “Only one of my relatives has ever visited me since I came to Springfeld, and that one, before he got out of town, was accused of stealing a jew's-harp. Now, if that is being a member of a proud, aristocratic family, then I am guilty of the offense.”

When the election came, Lincoln was defeated. It was the first political setback of his career.

Two years later he ran again and won. Mary Lincoln was ecstatic; believing that his political triumphs had just begun, she ordered a new evening gown and polished up her French verbs. As soon as her husband reached the capital, she addressed her letters to “The Honorable A. Lincoln.” But he put a stop to that at once.

She wanted to live in Washington, too, she longed to bask in the social prestige that she was sure awaited her. But when she came East to join him, she found things vastly different from what she had anticipated. Lincoln was so poor that he had had to borrow money from Stephen A. Douglas to pay his expenses until he got his first salary check from the Government; so Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln stopped at Mrs. Spriggs's boardinghouse in Duff Green's Row. The street in front of Mrs. Spriggs's establishment was unpaved, the sidewalk was made of ashes and gravel, the rooms were bleak, and there was no plumbing. In her back yard Mrs. Spriggs had an outhouse, a goose-pen, and a garden; and, as the neighbors' hogs were constantly breaking in to eat her vegetables, her little boy had to run out at intervals with a club to drive the animals away.

The city of Washington did not trouble in those days to collect the garbage; so Mrs. Spriggs dumped her refuse in the back alley, and depended upon the cows, pigs, and geese that wandered about the streets at will, to come and devour it.

Mrs. Lincoln found the door to the exclusive society of Washington shut tightly against her. She was ignored, and left alone to sit in her bleak boarding-house bedroom, with her spoiled children and a headache—listening to Mrs. Spriggs's boy, shouting to drive the hogs out of the cabbage-patch.

Disappointing as that was, it was nothing in comparison with the political disaster that lurked around the corner. When Lincoln entered Congress, the country had been waging a war against Mexico for twenty months—a shameful war of aggression, deliberately provoked by the slave power in Congress in order that the nation might acquire more territory where slavery would flourish and from which pro-slavery senators would be elected.

America accomplished two things in that war. Texas had once belonged to Mexico and then seceded. We forced Mexico to renounce all of her claims to Texas; and, in addition, we deliberately robbed Mexico of half of all the territory she owned and carved it up into the States of New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and California.

Grant said it was one of the wickedest wars in all history, and that he could never forgive himself for having fought in it. A great many of the American soldiers rebelled and went over to the enemy; one famous battalion in Santa Anna's army was composed entirely of American deserters.

Lincoln stood up in Congress and did what many other Whigs had already done: he attacked the President for having started “a war of rapine and murder, a war of robbery and dishonor,” and declared that the God of heaven had “forgotten to defend the weak and innocent, and permitted the strong band of murderers and demons from hell to kill men, women, and children and lay waste and pillage the land of the just.”

The capital paid no attention whatever to this speech, for Lincoln was unknown. But back in Springfield, it raised a hurricane. Illinois had sent six thousand men to fight, as they believed, for the holy cause of liberty; and now their representative was standing up in Congress and calling their soldiers demons from hell, and accusing them of murder. In a rage, excited partizans held public meetings and denounced Lincoln as “base...” “dastardly...” “infamous...” “a reasonable guerilla...” “a second Benedict Arnold.”

At one meeting resolutions were adopted declaring that never until then had they “known disgrace so black.” ... “Such black odium and infamy heaped upon the living brave and illustrious dead can but excite the indignation of every true Illinoisan.”

The hatred was so bitter that it smoldered for more than a decade; and when Lincoln was running for the Presidency thirteen years later these denunciations were again hurled at his head.

“I have committed political suicide,” Lincoln confessed to his law partner.

He dreaded to go back home now and face his resentful constituents; so he tried to secure a position that would keep him in Washington, and maneuvered to secure an appointment as Commissioner of the Land Office, but he failed.

Then he tried to have himself named Governor of the Territory of Oregon, with the hope that he might be one of the first senators when it came into the Union, but he failed in that too.

So he returned to Springfield and his dirty law office. Once more he hitched up Old Buck to his ramshackle buggy, and again he started driving over the circuit of the Eighth Judicial District—one of the most dejected men in all Illinois.

He was determined now to forget all about politics, and devote himself to his profession. He realized that he had no method in his work, that he lacked mental discipline; and so, to train himself to reason more closely and to demonstrate a proposition, he bought a geometry and carried it with him as he rode the circuit.

Herndon records in his biography:

At the little country inns, we usually occupied the same bed. In most cases the beds were too short for Lincoln, and his feet would hang over the footboard, thus exposing a limited expanse of shin bone. Placing a candle on a chair at the head of the bed, he would read and study for hours. I have known him to study in this position until two o'clock in the morning. Meanwhile, I and others who chanced to occupy the same room would be safely and soundly asleep. On the circuit in this way he studied Euclid until he could with ease demonstrate all the propositions in the six books.

After he had mastered geometry, he studied algebra, then astronomy, then he prepared a lecture on the origin and growth of languages. But no other study interested him as did Shakspere. The literary tastes that Jack Kelso had nurtured in New Salem still persisted.

The most striking characteristic of Abraham Lincoln, from this time on to the end of his life, was a sadness so profound, a melancholy so deep that mere words can hardly convey its depths.

When Jesse Weik was helping Herndon prepare his immortal biography, he felt that surely the reports of Lincoln's sadness must be exaggerated. So he went and discussed this point at length with the men who had been associated with Lincoln for years—men such as Stuart, Whitney, Matheny, Swett, and Judge Davis.

Then Weik was firmly convinced “that men who never saw Lincoln could scarcely realize his tendency to melancholy,” and Herndon, agreeing with him, went farther, making the statement from which I have already quoted: “If Lincoln ever had a happy day in twenty years, I never knew of it. A perpetual look of sadness was his most prominent feature. Melancholy dripped from him as he walked.”

When he was riding the circuit he would frequently sleep in the same room with two or three other attorneys. They would be awakened early in the morning by the sound of his voice and find him sitting on the edge of the bed, mumbling incoherently to himself. Getting up, he would start a fire and sit for hours, staring into the blaze. Frequently, on such occasions, he would recite “Oh, why should the spirit of mortal be proud?”

Sometimes as he walked down the street, he was so deep in despair that he took no notice of those who met him and spoke to him. Occasionally he shook hands with people without knowing what he was doing.

Jonathan Birch, who all but worshiped Lincoln's memory, says:

When attending court at Bloomington, Lincoln would keep his hearers in the court room, office or on the street convulsed with laughter at one hour and the next hour be so deeply submerged in speculation that no one dared arouse him.... He would sit in a chair tilted against the wall, his feet on the lower rung, legs drawn up and knees level with his chin, hat tipped forward, hands clasped about knees, eyes infinitely sad, the very picture of dejection and gloom. Thus absorbed I have seen him sit for hours at a time, defying the interruption of even his closest friends.

Senator Beveridge, after studying Lincoln's career perhaps more exhaustively than any one else has ever done, came to the conclusion that “the dominant quality in Lincoln's life from 1849 to the end was a sadness so profound that the depths of it cannot be sounded or estimated by normal minds.”

Yet Lincoln's inexhaustible humor, his amazing capacity for telling stories, were as striking and inseparable a part of his personality as his sadness.

At times Judge Davis even stopped court to listen to his boisterous humor.

“Crowds thronged about him, crowds of two hundred and three hundred,” says Herndon, holding their sides and laughing the hours away.

One eye-witness declares that when Lincoln reached the “nub” of a good story, men “whooped” and rolled off their chairs.

Those who knew Lincoln intimately agreed that “his abysmal sadness” was caused by two things: his crushing political disappointments and his tragic marriage.

And so the poignant years of apparently permanent political oblivion dragged by—six of them—and then suddenly an event occurred that altered the whole course of Lincoln's life, and started him toward the White House.

The instigator and moving spirit behind this event was Mary Lincoln's old sweetheart, Stephen A. Douglas.

In 1854, a tremendous thing happened to Lincoln. It came about as a result of the repeal of the Missouri Compromise. The Missouri Compromise, in brief, was this:

In 1819, Missouri had wanted to come into the Union as a slave State. The North had opposed its doing so and the situation became serious. Finally, the ablest public men of that day arranged what is now known as the Missouri Compromise. The South got what it wanted: the admission of Missouri as a slave State. The North got what it wanted: thereafter slavery was never to be permitted in the West anywhere north of the southern boundary of Missouri.

People thought that would stop the quarreling about slavery, and it did—for a while. But now, a third of a century later, Stephen A. Douglas secured the repeal of the Compromise, and made it possible for a new area lying west of the Mississippi and equal in size to the original thirteen States, to be blighted with the curse of slavery. He fought long and hard in Congress for the repeal. The struggle lasted for months. Once during the bitter debates in the House of Representatives, members leaped on top of their desks, knives flashed, and guns were drawn. But finally, after an impassioned plea by Douglas, lasting from midnight until almost dawn, the Senate passed his bill on March 4, 1854. It was a tremendous event. Messengers ran through the streets of the slumbering city of Washington, shouting the news. Cannon in the Navy Yard boomed to salute the dawn of a new era—a new era that was to be drenched in blood.

Why did Douglas do it? No one seems to know. Historians in skullcaps are still arguing about it. Of this much, however, we are certain: Douglas hoped to be elected President in 1856. He knew this repeal would help him in the South.

But what of the North?

“By God, I know it will raise a hell of a storm there,” he declared.

He was right. It did. It raised a regular tornado that blew both the great parties into bits, and eventually whirled the nation into civil war.

Meetings of protest and indignation flared up spontaneously in hundreds of cities and villages and hamlets. Stephen Arnold Douglas was denounced as the “traitor Arnold.” People said that he had been named after Benedict Arnold. He was branded as a modern Judas, and presented with thirty pieces of silver. He was given a rope and told to hang himself.

The churches leaped into the fight with a holy frenzy. Three thousand and fifty clergymen in New England wrote a protest “in the name of Almighty God and in His presence,” and laid it before the Senate. Fiery and indignant editorials fed the flames of public indignation. In Chicago even the Democratic papers turned upon Douglas with vindictive fierceness.

Congress adjourned in August, and Douglas started home. Amazed at the sights that met his eyes, he declared afterward that he could have traveled all the way from Boston to Illinois by the light of burning effigies of himself hanging by the neck.

Daring and defiant, he announced that he was going to speak in Chicago. The hatred against him there, in his own home town, amounted to nothing less than fanaticism. The press assailed him, and wrathful ministers demanded that he never again be permitted to “pollute the pure air of Illinois with his perfidious breath.” Men rushed to the hardware stores, and, by sundown, there wasn't another revolver left for sale in all the city. His enemies swore that he should never live to defend his infamous deeds.

The moment Douglas entered the city, boats in the harbor lowered their flags to half-mast; and bells in a score of churches tolled, mourning the death of Liberty.

The night that he spoke was one of the hottest Chicago had ever known. Perspiration rolled down the faces of men as they sat idling in their chairs. Women fainted as they struggled to get out to the shore of the lake where they could sleep on the cool sands. Horses fell in their harness and lay dying in the streets.

But notwithstanding the heat, thousands of excited men, guns in their pockets, flocked to hear Douglas. No hall in Chicago could hold the throng. They packed a public square, and hundreds stood on balconies and sat astride the roofs of near-by houses.

The very first sentence that Douglas uttered was greeted with groans and hisses. He continued to talk—or, at least, he continued to try—and the audience yelled and booed and sang insulting songs and called him names that are unprintable.

His excited partizans wanted to start a fight. Douglas begged them to be quiet. He would tame the mob. He kept on trying, but he kept on failing. When he denounced the “Chicago Tribune,” the great gathering cheered the paper. When he threatened to stand there all night unless they let him speak, eight thousand voices sang: “We won't go home until morning. We won't go home until morning.”

It was a Saturday night. Finally, after four hours of futility and insult, Douglas took out his watch and shouted at the howling, bellowing, milling mob: “It is now Sunday morning, I'll go to church. And you can go to hell.”

Exhausted, he gave up and left the speaker's stand. The Little Giant had met humiliation and defeat for the first time in his life.

The next morning the papers told all about it; and down in Springfield, a proud, plump brunette, trembling on the brink of middle age, read it with peculiar satisfaction. Fifteen years before, she had dreamed of being Mrs. Douglas. For years she had watched him mount on wings until he had become the most popular and powerful leader in the nation, while her husband had gone down in humiliating defeat; and, deep in her heart, she resented it.

But now, thank God, the haughty Douglas was doomed. He had split his own party in his own State. And just before the election. This was Lincoln's chance. And Mary Lincoln knew it—his chance to win back the public favor that he had lost in 1848, his chance to reinstate himself politically, his chance to be elected to the United States Senate. True, Douglas still had four more years to serve. But his colleague was coming up for reelection in a few months.

And who was his colleague? A swaggering, pugnacious Irishman named Shields. Mary Lincoln had an old score to settle with Shields, too. Back in 1842, largely because of insulting letters that she herself had written, Shields had challenged Lincoln to a duel; and the two of them, armed with cavalry swords and accompanied by their seconds, had met on a sand-bar in the Mississippi River, prepared to kill each other. But, at the last moment, friends interceded and prevented bloodshed. Since that time, Shields had gone up in politics, but Lincoln had gone down.

But now Lincoln had struck bottom, and had started to rebound. The repeal of the Missouri Compromise had, as he said, “aroused” him. He could no longer remain quiet. He was determined to strike with all the vigor and conviction of his soul.

So he began preparing his speech, working for weeks in the State library, consulting histories, mastering facts, classifying, clarifying, studying all the hot debates that had been thundered back and forth across the Senate chamber during the stormy passage of this bill.

On October 3 the State Fair opened at Springfield. Thousands of farmers poured into town; men bringing their prize hogs and horses, their cattle and corn; women fetching their jellies and jam, their pies and preserves. But these displays were all but forgotten in the excitement of another attraction. For weeks it had been advertised that Douglas was to speak the opening day of the fair, and political leaders from all parts of the State had thronged there to hear him.

That afternoon he spoke for more than three hours, going over his record, explaining, defending, attacking. He hotly denied that he was trying either “to legislate slavery into a territory or to exclude it therefrom.” Let the people in a territory do whatever they pleased about slavery.

“Surely,” he shouted, “if the people of Kansas and Nebraska are able to govern themselves, surely they are able to govern a few miserable Negroes.”

Lincoln sat near the front, listening to every word, weighing every argument. When Douglas finished, Lincoln declared: “I'll hang his hide on the fence to-morrow.”

The next morning handbills were scattered all over town and the fair-grounds, announcing that Lincoln would reply to Douglas. The public interest was intense, and before two o'clock every seat was occupied in the hall where the speaking was to take place. Presently Douglas appeared and sat on the platform. As usual, he was immaculately attired and faultlessly groomed.

Mary Lincoln was already in the audience. Before leaving the house that morning she had vigorously brushed Lincoln's coat, had laid out a fresh collar and carefully ironed his best tie. She was anxious to have him appear to advantage. But the day was hot, and Lincoln knew the air in the hall would be oppressive. So he strode onto the platform without a coat, without a vest, without a collar, without a tie. His long, brown, skinny neck rose out of the shirt that hung loosely on his gaunt frame. His hair was disordered, his boots rusty and unkempt. One single knitted “gallis” held up his short, ill-fitting trousers.

At the first sight of him, Mary Lincoln flushed with anger and embarrassment. She could have wept in her disappointment and despair.

No one dreamed of it at the time, but we know now that this homely man, whose wife was ashamed of him, was starting out that hot October afternoon on a career that was to give him a place among the immortals.

That afternoon, he made the first great speech of his life. If all the addresses that he had made previously were collected and placed in one book, and those that he made from that afternoon on were placed in another volume, you could hardly believe that the same man was the author of them all. It was a new Lincoln speaking that day—a Lincoln stirred to the depths by a mighty wrong, a Lincoln pleading for an oppressed race, a Lincoln touched and moved and lifted up by moral grandeur.

He reviewed the history of slavery, and gave five fiery reasons for hating it.

But with lofty tolerance, he declared: “I have no prejudice against the Southern people. They are just what we would be in their situation. If slavery did not now exist among them, they would not introduce it. If it did now exist among us, we should not instantly give it up. When Southern people tell us they are no more responsible for the origin of slavery than we are, I acknowledge the fact. When it is said that the institution exists, and that it is very difficult to get rid of it in any satisfactory way, I can understand and appreciate the saying. I surely will not blame them for not doing what I should not know how to do myself. If all earthly power were given me, I should not know what to do with the existing institution.”

For more than three hours, with the perspiration rolling down his face, he continued to answer Douglas, revealing the senator's sophistry, showing the utter falseness of his position.

It was a profound speech, and it made a profound impression. Douglas winced and writhed under it. Time after time he rose to his feet and interrupted Lincoln.

The election wasn't far off. Progressive young Democrats were already bolting the ticket and attacking Douglas, and when the voters of Illinois cast their ballots, the Douglas Democrats were overwhelmed.

Senators were chosen in those days by the State legislatures; and the Illinois Legislature met in Springfield on February 8, 1855, for that purpose. Mrs. Lincoln had bought a new dress and hat for the occasion and her brother-in-law, Ninian W. Edwards, had with sanguine anticipation arranged for a reception to be given that night in Senator Lincoln's honor.

On the first ballot, Lincoln led all the other candidates, and came within six votes of victory. But he steadily lost after that; and on the tenth ballot he was definitely defeated, and Lyman W. Trumbull was elected.

Lyman Trumbull had married Julia Jayne, a young woman who had been bridesmaid at Mary Lincoln's wedding and probably had been the most intimate friend that Mrs. Lincoln ever had. Mary and Julia sat side by side in the balcony of the Hall of Representatives that afternoon, watching the senatorial election; and when the victory of Julia's husband was announced, Mrs. Lincoln turned in a temper and walked out of the building. Her anger was so fierce, and her jealousy was so galling, that from that day on, to the end of her life, she never again spoke to Julia Trumbull.

Saddened and depressed, Lincoln returned to his dingy law office with the ink-stain on the wall and the garden seeds sprouting in the dust on top of the bookcase.

A week later he hitched up Old Buck and once more started driving over the unsettled prairies, from one country courthouse to another. But his heart was no longer in the law. He talked now of little else but politics and slavery. He said that the thought of millions of people held in bondage continually made him miserable. His periods of melancholy returned now more frequently than ever; and they were more prolonged and more profound.

One night he was sharing a bed with another lawyer in a country tavern. His companion awoke at dawn and found Lincoln sitting in his nightshirt on the edge of the bed, brooding, dejected, mumbling to himself, lost in unseeing abstraction. When at last he spoke, the first words were:

“I tell you this nation cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.”

Shortly after this a colored woman in Springfield came to Lincoln with a pitiful story. Her son had gone to St. Louis and taken a job on a Mississippi steamboat. When he arrived in New Orleans he was thrown into jail. He had been born free, but he had no papers to prove it. So he was kept in prison until his boat left. Now he was going to be sold as a slave to pay the prison expenses.

Lincoln took the case to the Governor of Illinois. The governor replied that he had no right or power to interfere. In response to a letter, the Governor of Louisiana replied that he couldn't do anything, either. So Lincoln went back to see the Governor of Illinois a second time, urging him to act, but the governor shook his head.

Lincoln rose from his chair, exclaiming with unusual emphasis: “By God, Governor, you may not have the legal power to secure the release of this poor boy, but I intend to make the ground in this country too hot for the foot of a slave-owner.”

The next year Lincoln was forty-six, and he confided to his friend Whitney that he “kinder needed” glasses; so he stopped at a jewelry store and bought his first pair—for thirty-seven and a half cents.





14


We have now come to the summer of 1858, and we are about to watch Abraham Lincoln making the first great fight of his life. We shall see him emerge from his provincial obscurity and engage in one of the most famous political battles in United States history.

He is forty-nine now—and where has he arrived after all his years of struggle?

In business, he has been a failure.

In marriage, he has found stark, bleak unhappiness.

In law, he is fairly successful, with an income of three thousand a year; but in politics and the cherished desires of his heart, he has met with frustration and defeat.

“With me,” he confessed, “the race of ambition has been a failure, a flat failure.”

But from now on events move with a strange and dizzying swiftness. In seven more years he will be dead. But in those seven years he will have achieved a fame and luster that will endure to the remotest generations.

His antagonist in the contest we are to watch is Stephen A. Douglas. Douglas is now a national idol. In fact, he is worldrenowned.

In the four years that had elapsed since the repeal of the Missouri Compromise, Douglas had made one of the most amazing recoveries in history. He had redeemed himself by a dramatic and spectacular political battle. It came about in this way:

Kansas knocked at the door of the Union, asking to be admitted as a slave State. But should she be so admitted? Douglas said “no,” because the legislature that had framed her constitution was not a real legislature. Its members had been elected by chicanery and shot-guns. Half the settlers in Kansas—men who had a right to vote—were never registered, and so couldn't vote. But five thousand pro-slavery Democrats who lived in western Missouri and had not the shadow of a legal right to cast ballots in Kansas went to a United States arsenal, armed themselves, and, on election day, marched over into Kansas with flags flying and bands playing—and voted for slavery. The whole thing was a farce, a travesty on justice.

And what did the free-State men do? They prepared for action. They cleaned up their shot-guns, oiled their rifles, and began banging away at signs on trees and knot-holes in barn doors, to improve their marksmanship. They were soon marching and drilling and drinking. They dug trenches, threw up breastworks, and turned hotels into forts. If they couldn't win justice with ballots, they would win it with bullets!

In almost every town and village throughout the North, professional orators harangued the citizenry, passed hats, and collected money to buy arms for Kansas. Henry Ward Beecher, pounding his pulpit in Brooklyn, cried that guns would do more for the salvation of Kansas than Bibles. From that time on, Sharp's rifles were known as “Beecher's Bibles.” They were shipped from the East in boxes and barrels labeled as “Bibles,” as “Crockery,” as “Revised Statutes.”

After five free-State settlers had been murdered, an old sheepraiser, a religious fanatic who cultivated grapes and made wine on the side, rose up on the plains of Kansas and said: “I have no choice. It has been decreed by Almighty God that I should make an example of these pro-slavery men.”

His name was John Brown, and he lived at Osawatomie.

One night in May he opened the Bible, read the Psalms of David to his family, and they knelt in prayer. Then after the singing of a few hymns, he and his four sons and a son-in-law mounted their horses and rode across the prairie to a pro-slavery man's cabin, dragged the man and his two boys out of bed, chopped off their arms, and split their heads open with an ax. It rained before morning, and the water washed some of the brains out of the dead men's skulls.

From that time on, both sides slew and stabbed and shot. The term “Bleeding Kansas” was written on the pages of history.

Now, Stephen A. Douglas knew that a constitution framed by a bogus legislature in the midst of all that fraud and treachery was not worth the blotting-paper that it took to dry it.

So Douglas demanded that the people of Kansas be permitted to vote at an honest and peaceful election on the question of whether Kansas should be admitted as a slave or a free State.

His demand was altogether right and proper. But the President of the United States, James Buchanan, and the haughty pro-slavery politicians in Washington wouldn't tolerate such an arrangement.

So Buchanan and Douglas quarreled.

The President threatened to send Douglas to the political shambles, and Douglas retaliated: “By God, sir, I made James Buchanan; and by God, sir, I'll unmake him.”

As Douglas said that, he not only made a threat, but he made history. In that instant, slavery had reached the apex of its political power and arrogance. From that moment on, its power declined with a swift and dramatic abruptness.

The battle that followed was the beginning of the end, for in that fight Douglas split his own party wide open and prepared the way for Democratic disaster in 1860, and so made the election of Lincoln not only possible but inevitable.

Douglas had staked his own political future on what he believed, and on what almost every one in the North believed, was an unselfish fight for a magnificent principle. And Illinois loved him for it. He had now come back to his home State, the most admired and idolized man in the nation.

The same Chicago that had hooted and lowered the flags to half-mast and tolled the church bells as he entered the city in 1854—that same Chicago now despatched a special train with brass bands and reception committees to escort him home. As he entered the city, one hundred and fifty cannon in Dearborn Park roared a welcome, hundreds of men fought to shake his hand, and thousands of women tossed flowers at his feet. People named their first-born in his honor; and it is probably no exaggeration to say that some of his frenzied followers would actually have died for him on the scaffold. Forty years after his death men still boasted that they were “Douglas Democrats.”

A few months after Douglas made his triumphal entry into Chicago the people of Illinois were scheduled to elect a United States Senator. Naturally the Democrats nominated Douglas. And whom did the Republicans put up to run against him? An obscure man named Lincoln.

During the campaign that followed, Lincoln and Douglas met in a series of fiery debates, and these debates made Lincoln famous. They fought over a question charged with emotional dynamite, public excitement rose to fever heat. Throngs such as had never been known before in the history of the United States rushed to hear them. No halls were large enough to accommodate them; so the meetings were held in the afternoon in groves or out on the prairies. Reporters followed them, newspapers played up the sensational contests, and the speakers soon had a nation for their audience.

Two years later, Lincoln was in the White House.

These debates had advertised him, they had paved the way.

For months before the contest began Lincoln had been preparing; as thoughts and ideas and phrases formed in his mind, he wrote them down on stray scraps of paper—on the backs of envelopes, on the margins of newspapers, on pieces of paper sacks. These he stored in his tall silk hat and carried about wherever he went. Finally he copied them on sheets of paper, speaking each sentence aloud as he wrote it, constantly revising, recasting, improving.

After completing the final draft of his first speech, he invited a few intimate friends to meet him one night in the library of the State House. There, behind locked doors, he read his speech, pausing at the end of each paragraph, asking for comments, inviting criticisms. This address contained the prophetic words that have since become famous:

“A house divided against itself cannot stand.”

“I believe this government cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.

“I do not expect the Union to be dissolved—I do not expect the house to fall—but I do expect it will cease to be divided.

“It will become all one thing or all the other.”

As he read that, his friends were astonished and alarmed. It was too radical, they said; it was “a damn fool utterance,” it would drive voters away.

Finally Lincoln rose slowly and told the group of the intense thought that he had given the subject, and ended the conference by declaring that the statement “A house divided against itself cannot stand” was the truth of all human experience.

“It has been true,” said Lincoln, “for six thousand years. And I want some universally known figure, expressed in a simple language, that will arouse men to the peril of the times. The time has come when this truth should be uttered, and I am determined neither to change nor modify my assertion. I am willing, if necessary, to perish with it. If it is decreed that I should go down because of this speech, then let me go down linked to the truth. Let me die in the advocacy of what is just and right.”




The first of the great debates was held on the twenty-first day of August in the little farming town of Ottawa, seventy-five miles out of Chicago. Crowds began arriving the night before. Soon the hotels, private houses, and livery-stables were filled to capacity; and for a mile up and down the valley camp-fires blazed on bluffs and bottom-lands as if the town were surrounded by an invading army.

Before daybreak the tide set in again; and the sun rose that morning over the Illinois prairies to look down on country roads filled with buggies and wagons, with pedestrians, and with men and women on horseback. The day was hot, the weather had been dry for weeks. Huge clouds of dust arose and drifted over the corn-fields and meadows.

At noon a special train of seventeen cars arrived from Chicago; seats were packed, aisles jammed, and eager passengers rode on the roofs.

Every town within forty miles had brought its band. Drums rolled, horns tooted, there was the tramp, tramp of parading militia. Quack doctors gave free snake-shows and sold their painkillers. Jugglers and contortionists performed in front of saloons. Beggars and scarlet women plied their trades. Firecrackers exploded, cannon boomed, horses shied and ran away.

In some towns, the renowned Douglas was driven through the streets in a fine carriage drawn by six white horses. A mighty hurrah arose. The cheering was continuous.

Lincoln's supporters, to show their contempt for this display and elegance, drove their candidate through the street on a decrepit old hay-rack drawn by a team of white mules. Behind him came another hay-rack filled with thirty-two girls. Each girl bore the name of a State, and above them rose a huge motto:

Westward the star of empire takes its way.

The girls link on to Lincoln as their mothers linked to Clay.

The speakers, committees, and reporters wedged and squeezed their way through the dense crowd for half an hour before they could reach the platform.

It was protected from the broiling sun by a lumber awning. A score of men climbed on the awning; it gave way under their weight; boards tumbled down on the Douglas committee.

In almost every way the two speakers differed sharply.

Douglas was five feet four. Lincoln was six feet four.

The big man had a thin tenor voice. The little man had a rich baritone.

Douglas was graceful and suave. Lincoln was ungainly and awkward. Douglas had the personal charm of a popular idol. Lincoln's sallow wrinkled face was filled with melancholy, and he was entirely lacking in physical magnetism.

Douglas was dressed like a rich Southern planter, in ruffled shirt, dark-blue coat, white trousers, and a white broad-brimmed hat. Lincoln's appearance was uncouth, grotesque: the sleeves of his rusty black coat were too short, his baggy trousers were too short, his high stovepipe hat was weather-beaten and dingy.

Douglas had no flair for humor whatever, but Lincoln was one of the greatest story-tellers that ever lived.

Douglas repeated himself wherever he went. But Lincoln pondered over his subject ceaselessly, until he said he found it easier to make a new speech each day than to repeat an old one.

Douglas was vain, and craved pomp and fanfare. He traveled on a special train draped in flags. On the rear of the train was a brass cannon mounted on a box-car. As he approached a town, his cannon fired time after time, to proclaim to the natives that a mighty man was at their gates.

But Lincoln, detesting what he called “fizzlegigs and fireworks,” traveled in day-coaches and freight-trains and carried a battered old carpet-bag, and a green cotton umbrella with the handle gone and a string tied around the middle to keep it from flapping open.

Douglas was an opportunist. He had no “fixed political morals,” as Lincoln said. To win—that was his goal. But Lincoln was fighting for a great principle, and it mattered to him very little who won now, if only justice and mercy triumphed in the end.

“Ambition has been ascribed to me,” he said. “God knows how sincerely I prayed from the first that this field of ambition might not be opened. I claim no insensibility to political honors; but to-day, could the Missouri Compromise be restored, and the whole slavery question replaced on the old ground of ‘toleration’ by necessity where it exists, with unyielding hostility to the spread of it, on principle, I would, in consideration, gladly agree that Judge Douglas should never be out, and I never in, an office, so long as we both or either, live.

“It makes little difference, very little difference, whether Judge Douglas or myself is elected to the United States Senate; but the great issue which we have submitted to you to-day is far above and beyond any personal interests or the political fortunes of any man. And that issue will live, and breathe, and burn, when the poor, feeble, stammering tongues of Judge Douglas and myself are silent in the grave.”

During these debates Douglas maintained that any State, anywhere, at any time, had a right to have slavery if the majority of its citizens voted for it. And he didn't care whether they voted it up or down. His celebrated slogan was this: “Let each State mind its own business and let its neighbors alone.”

Lincoln took directly the opposite stand.

“Judge Douglas's thinking slavery is right,” he explained, “and my thinking it wrong, is the precise fact upon which depends the whole controversy.

“He contends that whatever community wants slaves has a right to have them. So they have, if it is not a wrong. But if it is a wrong, he cannot say people have a right to do wrong.

“He cares as little whether a State shall be slave or free as whether his neighbor shall plant his farm with tobacco or stock it with horned cattle. But the great mass of mankind differ with Judge Douglas: they consider slavery a great moral wrong.”

Douglas went up and down the State, crying out time after time that Lincoln favored giving Negroes social equality.

“No,” retorted Lincoln, “all I ask for the Negro is that, if you do not like him, you let him alone. If God gave him but little, let him enjoy that little. He is not my equal in many respects, but in his right to enjoy ‘life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness,’ in his right to put into his mouth the bread that his hands have earned, he is my equal and the equal of Judge Douglas and the equal of every living man.”

In debate after debate Douglas accused Lincoln of wanting the whites to “hug and marry the blacks.”

And time after time, Lincoln was forced to deny it: “I object to the alternative which says that because I do not want a Negro woman for a slave, I must want her for a wife. I have lived until my fiftieth year, and have never had a Negro woman either for a slave or a wife. There are enough white men to marry all the white women; and enough Negro men to marry all the Negro women; and, for God's sake, let them be so married.”

Douglas tried to dodge and befog the issues. His arguments, Lincoln said, had got down to the point where they were as thin as “soup made by boiling the shadow of a pigeon that had starved to death.” He was using “specious and fantastic arrangements of words, by which a man can prove a horse-chestnut to be a chestnut horse.”

“I can't help feeling foolish,” continued Lincoln, “in answering arguments that are no arguments at all.”

Douglas said things that weren't true. He knew that they were falsehoods, and so did Lincoln.

“If a man,” responded Lincoln, “will stand up and assert, and repeat and reassert, that two and two do not make four, I know nothing that will stop him. I cannot work an argument into the consistency of a mental gag and actually close his mouth with it. I don't like to call Judge Douglas a liar, but when I come square up to him, I don't know what else to call him.”

And so the fight raged on, week after week. Day after day Lincoln continued his attacks. Others leaped into the fray. Lyman Trumbull called Douglas a liar, and declared that he had been guilty of “the most damnable effrontery that ever man put on.” Frederick Douglas, the famous Negro orator, came to Illinois and joined in the assault. The Buchanan Democrats waxed vicious and ferocious in their denunciation of Douglas. Carl Schurz, the fiery German-American reformer, indicted him before the foreign voters. The Republican press in screaming head-lines branded him as “a forger.” With his own party divided, and himself hounded and harassed on every side, Douglas was fighting against tremendous odds. In desperation, he wired his friend Usher F. Linder “The hell-hounds are on my track. For God's sake, Linder, come and help me fight them.”

The operator sold a copy of the telegram to the Republicans, and it was head-lined in a score of papers.

Douglas's enemies screamed with delight, and from that day on as long as he lived, the recipient of the telegram was called “For God's Sake Linder.”




On election night, Lincoln remained in the telegraph office, reading the returns. When he saw that he had lost, he started home. It was dark and rainy and gloomy. The path leading to his house had been worn pig-backed and was slippery. Suddenly, one foot shot from under and hit the other. Quickly he recovered his balance. “It's a slip,” he said, “and not a fall.”

Shortly after that he read an editorial about himself in an Illinois paper. It said:

Hon. Abe Lincoln is undoubtedly the most unfortunate politician that has ever attempted to rise in Illinois. In everything he undertakes, politically, he seems doomed to failure. He has been prostrated often enough in his political schemes to have crushed the life out of any ordinary man.

The vast crowds that had rushed to hear him debate with Douglas encouraged Lincoln to believe that he might make a little money now by giving lectures; so he prepared to talk on “Discoveries and Inventions,” rented a hall in Bloomington, stationed a young lady at the door to sell tickets—and not one solitary person came to hear him. Not one!

So once more he returned to his dingy office with the inkstain on the wall and the garden seeds sprouting on top of the bookcase.

It was high time he was getting back, for he had been away from his law practice for six months, earning nothing. Now he was out of funds entirely; he didn't have enough cash on hand even to pay his butcher's and grocer's bills.

So again he hitched up Old Buck to his ramshackle buggy, and again he started driving over the prairie circuit.

It was November, and a cold snap was coming. Across the gray sky above him wild geese flew southward, honking loudly; a rabbit darted across the road; off in the woods somewhere a wolf howled. But the somber man in the buggy neither saw nor heard what was going on about him. Hour after hour, he rode on, his chin on his breast, lost in speculation, submerged in despair.

When the newly formed Republican party met in Chicago in the spring of 1860 to nominate a Presidential candidate, few people dreamed that Abraham Lincoln had a chance. A short time before that, he himself had written to a newspaper editor: “I must in all candor say I do not think myself fit for the presidency.”

It was generally accepted in 1860 that the nomination honors were going to the handsome William H. Seward of New York. There could hardly be any question about that, for straw ballots were taken on the trains carrying the delegates to Chicago, and they gave Seward twice as many votes as all the other candidates combined. On many of the trains there was not a single ballot cast for Abraham Lincoln. It is possible that some of the delegates did not even know that such a man existed.

The convention met on Seward's fifty-ninth birthday. How fitting! He was positive that he would receive the nomination as a birthday present. He was so confident of it that he said good-by to his colleagues in the United States Senate and invited his intimate friends to attend a great feast of celebration at his home in Auburn, New York; and a cannon was rented, hauled into his front yard, loaded, and cocked up in the air, ready to boom the joyous news to the town.

If the convention had started balloting on Thursday night, that cannon would have been fired, and the story of a nation would have been changed; but the voting could not begin until the printer delivered the papers necessary for keeping the tally. And the printer, on his way to the convention, probably stopped for a glass of beer. At any rate, he was late, and consequently there was nothing for the convention to do that Thursday evening but sit and wait for him.

Mosquitoes were bad in the hall, the place was hot and stuffy, and the delegates hungry and thirsty; so some one stood up and moved that the convention adjourn until ten o'clock the next morning. A motion to adjourn is always in order; it takes precedence over all other motions and it is nearly always popular. This one carried with a rush of enthusiasm.

Seventeen hours elapsed before the convention assembled again. That is not a long time, but it was long enough for Seward's career to be wrecked, and Lincoln's made.

The person largely responsible for the wrecking was Horace Greeley, a grotesque-looking man with a head as round as a cantaloupe; with thin, silky hair as light as an albino's; and with a string necktie that usually worked itself out of place until the bow was approximately under his left ear.

Greeley was not even advocating the nomination of Lincoln, but he was determined with all the bitterness of his soul to even up an old score with William H. Seward and Seward's manager, Thurlow Weed.

The trouble was this: For fourteen years, Greeley had fought side by side with these men; he had helped make Seward Governor of New York and then United States Senator; and he had aided Weed tremendously in his battle to become and remain political boss of the State.

And what had Greeley gotten out of all this struggle and combat? Very little but neglect. He had wanted to be made State printer, and Weed had taken that place for himself. He had longed to be appointed postmaster of New York City, and Weed did not offer to recommend him. He had aspired to be governor, or even lieutenant-governor, and Weed not only said “no,” but said it in a way that hurt and rankled.

Finally, when he could stand no more, Greeley sat down and wrote a long, stinging letter to Seward. It would fill seven pages of this book, and every paragraph of it was seared with bitterness.

That fiery message had been written on Saturday night, November 11, 1854.... And this was 1860. Greeley had waited six long years for an opportunity to get his revenge, but at last it had arrived, and he made the most of it. He didn't go to bed at all, that fateful Thursday night while the Republican nominating convention was having a recess in Chicago; but from sundown until long after dawn, he hurried from delegation to delegation, reasoning, arguing, pleading. His paper, the “New York Tribune,” was read all over the North; and it influenced public opinion as no other paper had ever done. He was a famous man, voices were hushed whenever he appeared, and the delegates listened to him with respect.

He hurled all kinds of arguments against Seward. He pointed out that Seward had repeatedly denounced the Masonic order; that in 1830 he had been elected to the State Senate on the anti-Mason ticket, and, as a consequence had aroused bitter, widespread, and undying resentment.

Later, when he was Governor of New York, Seward had favored the destruction of the common-school fund and the establishment of separate schools for foreigners and Catholics, and thus had stirred up another hornet's nest of fiery hatred.

Greeley pointed out that the men who had made up the once powerful Know Nothing party were violently opposed to Seward and would vote for a hound dog in preference to him.

And that wasn't all. Greeley pointed out that this “arch agitator” had been too radical, that his “bloody program” and talk of a higher law than the Constitution had frightened the border States, and that they would turn against him.

“I will bring you the men who are candidates for governor in these States,” Greeley promised, “and they will confirm what I say.”

He did, and the excitement was intense.

With clenched fists and blazing eyes, the gubernatorial candidates in Pennsylvania and Indiana declared that Seward's nomination meant inevitable defeat in their States, inevitable disaster.

And the Republicans felt that, to win, they must carry those States.

So, suddenly, the flood-tide that had been running toward Seward began to recede. And Lincoln's friends rushed about from delegation to delegation, trying to persuade those who were opposed to Seward to concentrate on Lincoln. Douglas was sure to be nominated by the Democrats, they said, and no man in the country was better equipped to fight Douglas than Lincoln. To him, it was an old job; he was used to it. Besides, Lincoln was born a Kentuckian, and he could win votes in the doubtful border States. Furthermore, he was the kind of candidate the Northwest wanted—a man who had fought his way up from splitting rails and breaking sod, a man who understood the common people.

When arguments like these didn't succeed, they used others. They won Indiana's delegates by promising Caleb B. Smith a place in the Cabinet, and they won Pennsylvania's fifty-six votes with the assurance that Simeon Cameron would sit at Lincoln's right hand.

On Friday morning the balloting began. Forty thousand people had poured into Chicago, eager for excitement. Ten thousand wedged into the convention hall, and thirty thousand packed the streets outside. The seething mob reached for blocks.

Seward led on the first ballot. On the second, Pennsylvania cast her fifty-two votes for Lincoln, and the break began. On the third, it was all but a stampede.

Inside the hall, ten thousand people, half crazed with excitement, leaped upon the seats, shouting, yelling, smashing their hats on one another's heads. A cannon boomed on the roof—and thirty thousand people in the streets raised a shout.

Men hugged one another and danced about wildly, weeping and laughing and shrieking.

One hundred guns at the Tremont House belched and barked their volleys of fire; a thousand bells joined in the clamor; while whistles on railway engines, on steamboats, on factories, were opened and tied open for the day.

For twenty-four hours the excitement raged.

“No such uproar,” declared the “Chicago Tribune,” “has been heard on earth since the walls of Jericho fell down.” In the midst of all this rejoicing, Horace Greeley saw Thurlow Weed, the erstwhile “maker of Presidents,” shedding bitter tears. At last, Greeley had his sweet revenge.

In the meantime what was happening down in Springfield? Lincoln had gone to his law office as usual that morning and tried to work on a case. Too restless to concentrate, he soon tossed the legal papers aside and went out and pitched ball for a while back of a store, then played a game or two of billiards, and finally went to the “Springfield Journal” to hear the news. The telegraph office occupied the room above. He was sitting in a big arm-chair, discussing the second ballot, when suddenly the operator burst down the stairway, crying: “Mr. Lincoln, you are nominated! You are nominated!”

Lincoln's lower lip trembled slightly, his face flushed. For a few seconds he stopped breathing.

It was the most dramatic moment of his life.

After nineteen years of desolating defeats, he had been suddenly whirled to the dizzy heights of victory.

Men rushed up and down the streets shouting the news. The mayor ordered the firing of a hundred guns.

Scores of old friends flocked about Lincoln, half laughing, half crying, shaking his hands, tossing their hats into the air, yelling in mad excitement.

“Excuse me, boys,” he pleaded; “there is a little woman down on Eighth Street who will want to hear this.”

And away he dashed, his coat-tails sailing behind him.

The streets of Springfield were rosy all that night with the light of bonfires fed by tar-barrels and rail fences, and the saloons never closed their doors.

It wasn't long before half of the nation was singing:

Old Abe Lincoln came out of the wilderness,

Out of the wilderness, out of the wilderness;

Old Abe Lincoln came out of the wilderness,

Down in Illinois.

Stephen A. Douglas did more than any one else to elevate Lincoln to the White House, for Douglas split the Democratic party and put three candidates in the field against Lincoln instead of one.

With the opposition hopelessly divided, Lincoln realized, early in the contest, that he would be victorious; but, nevertheless, he feared that he would not be able to carry his own precinct or his home town. A committee made a house-to-house canvass in advance, to find out how the people in Springfield were going to ballot. When Lincoln saw the result of this canvass, he was astonished: all except three of the twenty-three ministers and theological students in town were against him, and so were many of their stanchest followers. Lincoln commented bitterly: “They pretend to believe in the Bible and be God-fearing Christians; yet by their ballots they are demonstrating that they don't care whether slavery is voted up or down. But I know God cares and humanity cares, and if they don't, surely they have not read their Bibles aright.”

It is surprising to discover that all of Lincoln's relatives on his father's side, and all except one on his mother's side, voted against him. Why? Because they were Democrats.

Lincoln was elected by a minority of the votes of the nation. His opponents had approximately three votes to his two. It was a sectional triumph, for of his two million votes only twenty-four thousand came from the South. A change of only one vote in twenty would have given the Northwest to Douglas and thrown the election into the House of Representatives, where the South would have won.

In nine Southern States no one cast a Republican ballot. Think of it. In all Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas not one man voted for Abraham Lincoln. This was ominous.

To appreciate what happened immediately after Lincoln's election, we must review the story of a movement that had raged over the North like a hurricane. For thirty years a fanatical group, obsessed by a holy zeal for the destruction of slavery, had been preparing the country for war. During all that time an unbroken stream of vitriolic pamphlets and bitter books had flowed from their presses; and paid lecturers had visited every city, town, and hamlet in the North, exhibiting the tattered, filthy garments worn by slaves, displaying their chains and manacles, holding up bloodstained whips and spiked collars and other instruments of torture. Escaped slaves themselves were pressed into service and toured the country, giving inflammatory accounts of brutalities they had seen and atrocities they had endured.

In 1839 the American Anti-Slavery Society issued a booklet entitled “American Slavery As It Is—The Testimony of 1,000 Witnesses.” In this pamphlet, eye-witnesses related specific instances of cruelties they had observed: slaves had had their hands plunged into boiling water, they had been branded with red-hot irons, their teeth had been knocked out, they had been stabbed with knives, their flesh had been torn by bloodhounds, they had been whipped until they died, had been burned at the stake. Shrieking mothers had had their children torn from them forever and sold in the slave-pen and on the auction-block. Women were whipped because they did not bear more children, and strong white men with big bones and large muscles were offered twenty-five dollars for cohabiting with black women, since light-colored children sold for more money, especially if they were girls.

The favorite and most flaming indictment of the Abolitionist was miscegenation. Southern men were accused of cherishing negro slavery because of their love of “unbridled licentiousness.”

“The South,” cried Wendell Phillips, “is one great brothel where half a million women are flogged to prostitution.”




Tales of sensuality so revolting that they could not be reprinted now, were broadcast in Abolition pamphlets then. Slaveowners were accused of violating their own mulatto daughters and selling them to be the mistresses of other men.

Stephen S. Foster declared that the Methodist Church in the South had fifty thousand black female members who were forced with whips to lead immoral lives, and he declared that the sole reason why Methodist preachers of that region favored slavery was because they wanted concubines for themselves.

Lincoln himself, during his debates with Douglas, declared that in 1850 there were 405,751 mulattoes in the United States, and that nearly all had sprung from black slaves and white masters.

Because the Constitution protected the rights of slave-owners, the Abolitionists cursed it as “a covenant with death and an agreement with hell.”

As a climax to all Abolition literature, the wife of a povertystricken professor of theology sat down at her dining-room table and wrote a book which she called “Uncle Tom's Cabin.” Sobbing as she wrote, she told her story in a storm of feeling. Finally she said God was writing the story. It dramatized and made real the tragedies of slavery as nothing else had ever done. It stirred the emotions of millions of readers and achieved a greater sale and exerted a more profound influence than any other novel that has ever been written.

When Lincoln was introduced to Harriet Beecher Stowe, the author, he called her the little woman that started the big war.

And what was the result of this well-meant but fanatical campaign of overstatement waged by the Abolitionists of the North? Did it convince the Southerners that they were wrong? Far from it. The effect was such as might have been expected. The hatred stirred up by the Abolitionists did what hatred always does: it bred hatred in return. It made the South wish to part company with its insolent, meddlesome critics. Truth seldom flourishes in an atmosphere of politics or of emotion, and on both sides of the Mason and Dixon's Line tragic error had grown to its bloody blossom time.

When the “black Republicans” elected Lincoln in 1860, the Southerners were firmly convinced that slavery was doomed, and that they had to choose at once between abolition and secession. So why not secede? Didn't they have a right to?

That question had been hotly debated back and forth for half a century, and various States at one time or another had threatened to leave the Union. For example: during the War of 1812 the New England States talked very seriously of forming a separate nation; and the Connecticut Legislature passed a resolution declaring that “the state of Connecticut is a free, sovereign and independent state.”

Even Lincoln himself had once believed in the right of secession. He had said during a speech in Congress: “Any people anywhere, being inclined and having the power, have the right to rise up and shake off the existing government, and form a new one that suits them better. That is a most valuable, a most sacred right—a right which we hope and believe is to liberate the world. Nor is the right confined to cases in which the whole people of an existing government may choose to exercise it. Any portion of such people that can, may revolutionize and make their own of so much of the territory as they inhabit.”

He had said that in 1848. This, however, was 1860, and he no longer believed it. But the South did. Six weeks after Lincoln's election South Carolina passed an Ordinance of Secession. Charleston celebrated the new “Declaration of Independence” with martial music and bonfires and fireworks and dancing in the streets. Six other States followed in rapid succession; and two days before Lincoln left Springfield for Washington, Jefferson Davis was elected President of a new nation, founded upon what was called “the great truth... that slavery is the negro's natural and normal condition.”

The outgoing administration of Buchanan, honeycombed with disloyalty, did nothing whatever to prevent all this; so Lincoln was obliged to sit helplessly in Springfield for three months, and watch the Union dissolving and the republic tottering on the verge of ruin. He saw the Confederacy buying guns and building forts and drilling soldiers; and he realized that he would have to lead a people through a civil war—bitter and bloody.

He was so distressed that he couldn't sleep at night. He lost forty pounds in weight, from worry.

Lincoln, who was superstitious, believed that coming events cast their shadow through dreams and omens. The day after his election in 1860 he went home in the afternoon and threw himself down on a haircloth sofa. Opposite him was a bureau with a swinging mirror; and, as he looked into the mirror, he saw himself reflected with one body but with two faces—one very pale. He was startled, and he got up, but the illusion vanished. He lay down again, and there was the ghost, plainer than before. The thing worried and haunted him; and he told Mrs. Lincoln about it. She was sure it was a sign that he would be elected to a second term of office, but that the death pallor of one face meant he would not live through the second term.

Lincoln himself soon came to believe very strongly that he was going to Washington to die. He received scores of letters with sketches of gibbets and stilettoes; and almost every mail brought him threats of death.




After the election, Lincoln said to a friend:

“I am worrying to know what to do with my house. I don't want to sell myself out of a home, but if I rent it, it will be pretty well used up by the time I get back.”

But finally he found a man who he thought would take care of the place and keep it in repair; so Lincoln rented it to him for ninety dollars a year; and then inserted this notice in the “Springfield Journal:”

The furniture consisting of Parlor and Chamber Sets, Carpets, Sofas, Chairs, Wardrobes, Bureaus, Bedsteads, Stoves, China, Queensware, Glass, etc., at the residence on the corner of Eighth and Jackson Street is offered at private sale without reserve. For particulars apply at the premises at once.

The neighbors came and looked things over. One wanted a few chairs and a cook-stove, another asked the price of a bed.

“Take whatever you want,” Lincoln probably replied, “and pay me what you think it is worth.”

They paid him little enough.

Mr. L. L. Tilton, superintendent of the Great Western Railway, bought most of the furniture; and later took it with him to Chicago, where it was destroyed in the great fire of 1871.

A few pieces remained in Springfield; and years afterward a bookseller purchased as much of it as possible and took it to Washington and installed it in the rooming-house where Lincoln died. That house stands almost directly across the street from Ford's Theater, and is now the property of the United States Government—a national shrine and museum.

The second-hand chairs that Lincoln's neighbors could have bought for a dollar and a half piece, are to-day worth more than their weight in gold and platinum. Everything that Lincoln touched intimately has now taken on value and glory. The black walnut rocking-chair in which he sat when Booth shot him, sold in 1929 for two thousand five hundred dollars. And a letter that he wrote appointing Major-General Hooker Commander-in-Chief of the Army of the Potomac recently sold at public auction for ten thousand dollars, while a collection of four hundred and eighty-five telegrams that he sent during the war, now owned by Brown University, are valued at a quarter of a million dollars. An unsigned manuscript of one of his unimportant talks was recently purchased for eighteen thousand dollars, and a copy of the Gettysburg address in Lincoln's handwriting brought hundreds of thousands.

The people of Springfield in 1861 little realized what caliber of man Lincoln was, and what he was destined to become.

For years the future great President had been walking down their streets almost every morning with a market-basket over his arm, a shawl about his neck, going to the grocery store and butcher's shop and carrying home his provisions. For years he had been going out each evening to a pasture on the edge of town and cutting out his cow from the rest of the herd and driving her home and milking her, grooming his horse, cleaning the stable, and cutting the firewood and carrying it in for the kitchen stove.




Three weeks before he left for Washington, Lincoln began the preparation of his first inaugural address. Wanting solitude and seclusion, he locked himself in an upstairs room over a general store and set to work. He owned very few books himself; but his law partner had something of a library, and Lincoln asked Herndon to bring him a copy of the Constitution, Andrew Jackson's Proclamation against Nullification, Henry Clay's great speech of 1850, and Webster's Reply to Hayne. And so amidst a lot of plunder in dingy, dusty surroundings, Lincoln wrote the famous speech ending with this beautiful plea to the Southern States:

I am loath to close. We are not enemies but friends. We must not be enemies. Though passion may have strained, it must not break our bonds of affection. The mystic chords of memory, stretching from every battlefield and patriot's grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land, will swell the chorus of the Union when again touched, as surely they will be, by the better angel of our nature.

Before leaving Illinois he traveled seventy miles to Charleston, in that State, to say farewell to his stepmother. He called her “Mamma,” as he had always done; and she clung to him, saying between her sobs: “I didn't want you to run for President, Abe, and I didn't want to see you elected. My heart tells me that something will happen to you, and that I'll never see you again till we meet in heaven.”

During those last days in Springfield, he thought often of the past and New Salem and Ann Rutledge, dreaming once again the dreams that had proved to be far beyond all earthly realities. A few days before he left for Washington he talked at length about Ann, to a New Salem pioneer who had come to Springfield to reminisce and say farewell. “I loved her deeply,” Lincoln confessed, “and I think of her now very, very often.”

The night before he left Springfield forever Lincoln visited his dingy law office for the last time and settled a few business details. Herndon tells us:

After these things were all disposed of, he crossed to the opposite side of the room and threw himself down on the old office sofa, which, after many years of service, had been moved against the wall for support. He lay for some moments, his face toward the ceiling, without either of us speaking. Presendy he inquired, “Billy, how long have we been together?”

“Over sixteen years,” I answered.

“We've never had a cross word during all that time, have we?” to which I returned a vehement, “No, indeed we have not.”

He then recalled some incidents of his early practice and took great pleasure in delineating the ludicrous features of many a lawsuit on the circuit.... He gathered a bundle of books and papers he wished to take with him and started to go; but before leaving he made the strange request that the sign-board which swung on its rusty hinges at the foot of the stairway should remain. “Let it hang there undisturbed,” he said, with a significant lowering of his voice. “Give our clients to understand that the election of a President makes no change in the firm of Lincoln and Herndon. If I live I'm coming back some time, and then we'll go right on practising law as if nothing had ever happened.”

He lingered for a moment as if to take a last look at the old quarters, and then passed through the door into the narrow hallway. I accompanied him downstairs. On the way he spoke of the unpleasant features surrounding the Presidential office. “I am sick of office-holding already,” he complained, “and I shudder when I think of the tasks that are still ahead.”

Lincoln probably was worth about ten thousand dollars at the time; but he was so short of cash then that he had to borrow money from his friends to pay for his trip to Washington.

The Lincolns spent their last week in Springfield at the Chenery House. The night before they left, their trunks and boxes were brought down to the hotel lobby and Lincoln himself roped them. Then he asked the clerk for some of the hotel cards, turned them over, and wrote on the back: “A. Lincoln, Executive Mansion, Washington, D.C.,” and tacked them on his baggage.

The next morning, at half-past seven, the dilapidated old bus backed up to the hotel, and Lincoln and his family got in and jolted away to the Wabash station, where a special train was waiting to take them to Washington.

It was dark and rainy, but the station platform was crowded with a thousand or fifteen hundred of his old neighbors. They formed a line and slowly filed by Lincoln, shaking his great bony hand. Finally the ringing of the engine bell warned him that it was time to go aboard. He entered his private car by the front steps and a minute later appeared on the rear platform.

He had not intended to make a speech. He had told the newspaper reporters that it would not be necessary for them to be at the station, as he would have nothing to say. However, as he looked for the last time into the faces of his old neighbors, he felt he must say something. The words he uttered that morning in the falling rain are not to be compared with those he spoke at Gettysburg, or placed beside the sublime spiritual masterpiece that he pronounced on the occasion of his second inauguration. But this farewell speech is as beautiful as one of the Psalms of David, and it contains perhaps more of personal emotion and pathos than any other of Lincoln's addresses.

There were only two times in his life that Lincoln wept when trying to speak. This morning was one of them:

“My friends: No one, not in my situation, can appreciate my feeling of sadness at this parting. To this place, and the kindness of these people, I owe everything. Here I have lived a quarter of a century, and have passed from a young to an old man. Here my children have been born, and one is buried. I now leave, not knowing when or whether ever I may return, with a task before me greater than that which rested upon Washington. Without the assistance of that Divine Being who ever attended him, I cannot succeed. With that assistance, I cannot fail. Trusting in Him, who can go with me, and remain with you, and be everywhere for good, let us confidently hope that all will yet be well. To His care commending you as I hope in your prayers you will commend me, I bid you an affectionate farewell.”

While Lincoln was en route to Washington for his inauguration, both the United States Secret Service and private detectives discovered what they believed was a plot to assassinate him as he passed through Baltimore.

In alarm Lincoln's friends pleaded with him to abandon the schedule that had been announced, and urged him to slip into Washington incognito by night.

That sounded cowardly, and Lincoln knew it would raise a storm of scoffs and sneers. He was decidedly against it. But finally, after hours of pleading, he bowed to the wishes of his trusted advisers, and prepared to make the rest of the trip secretly.

As soon as Mrs. Lincoln heard about the altered arrangements she insisted that she would go with him, and when she was told most emphatically that she must come on a later train she lost her temper and protested so loudly that she all but gave the plan away.

It had been announced that Lincoln would speak in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on February 22, spend the night there, and then leave the next morning for Baltimore and Washington.

He made his speech in Harrisburg according to schedule; but, instead of spending the night there, he slipped out of the back door of the hotel that evening at six and, disguised in an old threadbare overcoat and a soft wool hat such as he had never worn before, he was driven to an unlighted railway coach, and a few minutes later an engine was whirling him away to Philadelphia, and the telegraph wires in Harrisburg were cut at once so that the information would not be relayed to the would-be assassins.

At Philadelphia, his party had to wait for an hour to change trains and stations. In order to prevent recognition during that time, Lincoln and Allan Pinkerton, the famous detective, drove about the streets of the city in a darkened cab.

At 10:55, leaning on Pinkerton's arm and stooping so as not to draw attention to his height, Lincoln entered the station by a side door. He carried his head bent forward and had his old traveling shawl drawn close so that it almost covered his face. In that guise, he crossed the waiting-room and made his way to the rear section of the last sleeping-car on the train, which one of Pinkerton's aides, a woman, had had cut off from the rest of the car by a heavy curtain and reserved for her “invalid brother.”

Lincoln had received scores of threatening letters, declaring that he would never live to enter the White House, and General Winfield Scott, Commander-in-Chief of the Army, feared that Lincoln would be shot during the inaugural address—and so did thousands of others.

Many people in Washington were afraid to attend the ceremony.

So old General Scott had sixty soldiers stationed under the platform at the east portico of the Capitol from which Lincoln read his inaugural address; and he had soldiers standing on guard in the Capitol behind the President, and soldiers encircling the audience in front of him. And after the ceremony, the new President stepped into a carriage and rode back through Pennsylvania Avenue under the protection of buildings covered with sharpshooters in green coats, and between rows of infantrymen with bristling bayonets.

When he finally reached the White House without a bullet in his heart, many people were surprised.

Others were disappointed.




For several years prior to 1861 the nation had been struggling under a financial depression. Suffering had been so intense that the Government had been compelled to send troops to New York City to prevent hungry mobs from breaking into the sub-Treasury.

Thousands of gaunt, desperate men were still looking for work when Lincoln was inaugurated; and they knew that the Republicans, coming into power for the first time, would dismiss all Democratic office-holders, even down to the ten-dollar-aweek clerks.

Scores of applicants were scrambling for every job; and Lincoln had not been in the White House two hours when he was overwhelmed by them. They rushed through the halls; jammed the corridors; took entire possession of the East Room; and invaded even the private parlors.

Beggars came, importuning him for the price of a lunch. One man wanted Lincoln to give him an old pair of pants.

A widow came, seeking an appointment for a man who had promised to marry her provided she could get him an office that would support a family.

Hundreds came merely to get his autograph. An Irishwoman who kept a boarding-house rushed to the White House to implore Lincoln to help her collect a board bill from a government clerk.

As soon as an office-holder became seriously ill, dozens of applicants flocked to Lincoln, asking for the appointment “in case he should die.”

Every one was armed with testimonials, but of course Lincoln couldn't read a tenth of them. One day when two applicants for the same post-office thrust huge bundles of letters into his hands he simplified matters by tossing both packages unopened onto the scales, and appointed the man who had the heavier one.

Scores came to see Lincoln again and again, demanding jobs and abusing him savagely because he refused. Many were loafers without a shred of merit. One woman came asking for an appointment for her husband, admitting he was too drunk to come himself.

Their sordid selfishness, their voracious greed, appalled Lincoln. They intercepted him on his way to lunch. They rushed up to his carriage as he drove through the streets, presenting their credentials, begging for jobs. Even after Lincoln had been President for a year and the nation had been at war for ten months, the milling mob still hounded him.

“Will they never cease?” he exclaimed.

The mad onslaught of office-seekers had killed Zachary Taylor before he had been President a year and a half. The worry of it killed “Tippecanoe” Harrison in four weeks. But Lincoln had to endure the office-seekers and run a war at the same time. Finally, however, even his iron constitution all but broke under the strain. Stricken with an attack of smallpox, he said:

“Tell all the office-seekers to come at once, for now I have something I can give to all of them.”

Lincoln hadn't been in the White House twenty-four hours when he was confronted with a grave and momentous problem. The garrison holding Fort Sumter, in the harbor at Charleston, South Carolina, was almost out of food. The President had to decide whether to provision the fort or surrender it to the Confederates.

His army and navy advisers said: “Don't try to send food. If you do, it will mean war.”

Six of the seven members of his Cabinet said the same thing. But Lincoln knew that he couldn't evacuate Sumter without virtually recognizing secession and encouraging it, and dissolving the Union.

In his inaugural address he had declared that he had the most solemn oath “registered in heaven” to “preserve, protect, and defend” the Union. He intended to keep his oath.

So he gave the orders, and away sailed the U.S.S. Powhatan, carrying bacon and beans and bread for Fort Sumter. But no guns, no men, no ammunition.

When Jefferson Davis heard the news he telegraphed General Beauregard to attack Fort Sumter if he thought it necessary.

Major Anderson, in command of the fortress, sent word to General Beauregard that, if he would wait only four days, the garrison would be compelled to evacuate through starvation, for they were already living on nothing but salt pork.

Why didn't Beauregard wait?

Perhaps it was because a few of his advisers felt that “unless blood were sprinkled in the faces of the people,” some of the seceding States might return to the Union.

Shooting a few Yankees would arouse enthusiasm and cement the Confederacy.

So Beauregard issued his tragic orders; and, at half-past four on the morning of April 12, a shell screamed through the air and fell hissing into the sea near the walls of the fort.

For thirty-four hours, the bombardment continued.

The Confederates turned the affair into a social event. Brave young men, gay in their new uniforms, fired their cannon to the applause of fashionable society women promenading the wharves and the Battery.

On Sunday afternoon the Union soldiers surrendered the fort and four barrels of salt pork; and, with the Stars and Stripes flying, and the band playing “Yankee Doodle,” they sailed away, bound for New York.

For a week Charleston abandoned itself to joy. A Te Dewn was sung with great pomp in the cathedral; and crowds paraded the streets, drinking and singing and carousing in tap rooms and taverns.

Judged by the loss of life, the bombardment of Sumter was nothing. Neither side lost a man. But judged by the train of events which it set in motion, few battles have been more momentous. It was the beginning of the bloodiest war the world had ever known up to that time.





PART THREE


18


Lincoln issued a call for seventy-five thousand men, and threw the country into a frenzy of patriotic fervor. Mass-meetings were held in thousands of halls and public squares, bands played, flags waved, orators harangued, fireworks were set off; and men, leaving the plow and the pencil, flocked to the flag.

In ten weeks, a hundred and ninety thousand recruits were drilling and marching and singing:

John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave,

But his soul goes marching on.

But who was to lead these troops to victory? There was one recognized military genius in the army then—and only one. His name was Robert E. Lee. He was a Southerner; but, nevertheless, Lincoln offered him the command of the Union Army. If Lee had accepted, the whole history of the war would have been vastly different. For a time he did think seriously of accepting: thought about it, read his Bible, and got down on his knees and prayed about it, and paced the floor of his bedchamber all night, trying honestly to come to a righteous decision.

He agreed with Lincoln on many things. He hated slavery as Lincoln hated it; Lee had freed his own negroes long ago. He loved the Union almost as Lincoln loved it; he believed that it was “perpetual,” that secession was “revolution,” that “no greater calamity” could befall the nation.

But—and this was the trouble—he was a Virginian, a proud Virginian, a Virginian who put State above Nation. For two hundred years his forebears had been mighty factors in the destiny, first of the Colony, and then of the State. His father, the famous “Light Horse Harry” Lee, had helped Washington chase the redcoats of King George; after that, he had been Governor of Virginia; and he had taught his son, Robert E., to love the State more than the Union.

So when Virginia cast her lot with the South, Lee quietly announced: “I cannot lead a hostile army against my relatives, my children and my home. I go to share the miseries of my people.”

That decision probably lengthened the Civil War by two or three years.

To whom could Lincoln now turn for help and guidance? General Winfield Scott was then in command of the army. Scott was an old man. He had won a notable victory at Lundy's Lane in the War of 1812. And this was 1861. Forty-nine years later. He was weary, now, in body and mind. His youthful initiative and courage had long since perished.

Besides, he was suffering from a spinal affliction. “For more than three years,” he wrote, “I have been unable to mount a horse or walk more than a few paces at a time, and that with much pain.”

In addition, he now had “other and new infirmities—dropsy and vertigo.”

Such was the man to whom Lincoln had to look to lead the nation to victory: a broken old soldier who ought to have been in the hospital, with a nurse and a water mattress.

Lincoln had called in April for seventy-five thousand men to serve for three months. Their enlistments would expire in July; so, in the last part of June, a great hue and cry arose for action! Action! Action!

Day after day Horace Greeley kept “The Nation's War Cry” standing in bold type at the head of the “Tribune's” editorial columns: “Forward to Richmond!”

Business was bad. The banks were afraid to extend credit. Even the Government had to pay twelve per cent for borrowed money. People were disturbed. “Now, look here,” they said, “there is no use fooling any longer. Let's strike one sharp blow, capture Lee's army, and have this nasty mess over and done with once and for all.”

That sounded attractive, and every one agreed.

Every one except the military authorities: they knew the army wasn't ready. But the President, bowing to public clamor, finally ordered an advance.

So, on a hot, brilliant July day, McDowell, with his “Grand Army,” thirty thousand strong, marched away to attack the Confederates at Bull Run, a creek in Virginia. No American general then living had ever before commanded so large a body of men.

What an army it was! Raw. Half trained. Several of the regiments had arrived within the last ten days, and had no idea of discipline.

“With all my personal effort,” said Sherman, who commanded a brigade, “I could not prevent the men from straggling for water, blackberries, and anything on the way that they fancied.”

The Zouaves and Turcos in those days were regarded as mighty warriors; so many soldiers aspired to dress like them and act like them. Consequently, thousands of the troops marched away to Bull Run, that day, with their heads in scarlet turbans, their legs in red baggy breeches. They looked more like a comicopera troupe than men marching to death.

Several silk-hatted Congressmen drove out to watch the battle, taking with them their wives and pet dogs, and baskets of sandwiches and bottles of Bordeaux.

Finally, at ten o'clock on a broiling day in late July, the first real battle of the Civil War began.

What happened?

As soon as some of the inexperienced troops saw cannonballs crashing through the trees, heard men shrieking, and saw them pitching forward on the ground with blood running out of their mouths—as soon as they saw this, the Pennsylvania regiment and the New York Battery happened to recall that their ninety-day term of enlistment had expired; and they insisted on being mustered out of service. Then and there! Quick! And, as McDowell reports, they “moved to the rear to the sound of the enemy's cannon.”

The rest of the troops fought surprisingly well until about half-past four in the afternoon. Then suddenly the Confederates, throwing twenty-three hundred fresh men into the assault, took the field by storm.

From mouth to mouth ran the report, “Johnston's army has come.”

A panic ensued.

Twenty-five thousand soldiers, refusing to obey orders, broke from the field in mad confusion. McDowell and scores of officers made frantic efforts to stem the rout, but it was useless.

Quickly the Confederate artillery shelled the road, already jammed with fleeing soldiers and commissariat wagons and ambulances and the carriages of silk-hatted, sightseeing Congressmen. Women screamed and fainted. Men shouted and cursed and trampled on one another, A wagon was upset on a bridge. The highway was clogged. Plunging and kicking horses were cut from wagons and ambulances and artillery pieces; and frightened men in red turbans and yellow trousers leaped upon them and dashed away, the traces trailing in the dust, the harness dragging at their heels.

They imagined that the Confederate cavalry was in close pursuit. The cry of “the cavalry! the cavalry!” convulsed them with fear.

The grand debacle had now become a terror-stricken mob.

Nothing like it had ever before been witnessed on any American battle-field.

Maddened men threw away their guns, coats, caps, belts, bayonets, and fled as if driven by some unknown fury. Some sank on the road in utter exhaustion and were crushed beneath the oncoming horses and wagons.

The day was Sunday, and the distant roar of the cannon twenty miles away reached Lincoln's ears as he sat in church. At the close of the services, he rushed to the War Department, to read the telegrams that had already begun to pour in from different parts of the field. Fragmentary and incomplete as they were, Lincoln was eager to discuss them with General Scott; so he hurried to the old general's quarters, and found him taking a nap.

General Scott awoke, yawned, rubbed his eyes; but he was so infirm he couldn't get up without help. “He had some sort of harness with a pulley arrangement attached to the ceiling of the room; and, grasping the strap, he pulled his vast bulk into an upright position and swung his feet off the lounge upon the floor.”

“I don't know,” he said, “how many men are in the field, where they are, how they are armed, how they are equipped, or what they are capable of doing. Nobody comes to tell me, and I am in ignorance about it.”

And he was the head of all the Union armies!

The old general looked at a few telegrams that were coming in from the battle-field, told Lincoln there was nothing to worry about, complained of his aching back, and went to sleep again.

At midnight the broken army, in a riot of disorder, began to stagger across the Long Bridge and pour over the Potomac into Washington.

Tables were quickly set up on the sidewalks, wagon-loads of bread suddenly appeared from somewhere, and society women stood over wash-boilers of steaming soup and coffee, dispensing food.

McDowell, utterly exhausted, had fallen asleep under a tree while writing a despatch, his pencil still in his hand, a sentence half finished. His soldiers were too weary now to care for anything, so they threw themselves on the sidewalks and slept, inert as dead men, in the steadily falling rain—some still clutching their muskets as they slept.

Lincoln sat that night until long after dawn, listening to the stories of the newspaper correspondents and silk-hatted civilians who had witnessed the debacle.

Many public men were thrown into a panic. Horace Greeley wanted to end the war at once, on any terms. He was positive the South could never be conquered.

London bankers were so certain that the Union would be destroyed that their agent in Washington rushed to the Treasury Department on Sunday afternoon, demanding that the United States Government give security immediately for forty thousand dollars that was owing them.

He was told to come back on Monday, that the United States Government would probably still be doing business at the old stand then.

Failure and defeat were not new experiences to Lincoln. He had known them all his life; they did not crush him; his faith in the ultimate triumph of his cause remained firm, his confidence unshaken. He went among the disheartened soldiers, shaking hands with them, and saying over and over: “God bless you. God bless you.” He cheered them, sat down and ate beans with them, revived their drooping spirits, and talked of brighter to-morrows.

It was to be a long war. He saw that now. So he asked Congress for a levy of four hundred thousand men. Congress raised him a hundred thousand, and authorized half a million to serve for three years.

But who could lead them? Old Scott, unable to walk, unable to get out of bed without a harness and pulley, and snoring the afternoon away during a battle? Absolutely not. He was slated for the discard.

And there now gallops into the limelight one of the most charming and disappointing generals that ever sat in a saddle.

Lincoln's troubles were not over. They were just beginning.





19


During the first few weeks of the war a handsome young general named McClellan marched into West Virginia with twenty cannon and a portable printing-press, and whipped a few Confederates. His battles didn't amount to much—mere skirmishes. That was all. But they were the first victories of the North, so they seemed important. McClellan saw to that; he dashed off scores of dramatic and bombastic despatches on his portable press, proclaiming his achievements to the nation.

A few years later his absurd antics would have been laughed at; but the war was new then, people were confused and eager for some kind of leader to appear; so they took this boastful young officer at his own valuation. Congress offered him a resolution of thanks, people called him “the Young Napoleon,” and after the defeat at Bull Run Lincoln brought him to Washington and made him commander of the Army of the Potomac.

He was a born leader of men. His troops would burst into applause when they saw him galloping toward them on his white charger. Besides, he was a hard and conscientious worker; he took the army that had been crushed at Bull Run, drilled it, renewed its self-confidence, and built up its morale. No one could excel him at that sort of thing; and by the time October came he had one of the largest and best-trained armies that had ever been seen in the Western world. His troops were not only trained to fight; they were eager for the fray.

Every one was crying for action—every one but McClellan. Lincoln repeatedly urged him to strike a blow. But he wouldn't do it. He held parades and talked a lot about what he was going to do; but that was all it amounted to—talk.

He delayed, he procrastinated, he gave all manner of excuses. But go forward he would not.

Once he said he couldn't advance because the army was resting. Lincoln asked him what it had done to make it tired.

Another time—after the Battle of Antietam—an amazing thing happened. McClellan had far more men than Lee. Lee had been defeated; and had McClellan pursued him, he might have captured his army and ended the war. Lincoln kept urging him for weeks to follow Lee—urging by letter, by telegram, and by special messenger. Finally McClellan said he couldn't move because his horses were fatigued and had sore tongues!

It you ever visit New Salem, you will see a depression about a rod down the hillside from Offut's grocery where Lincoln worked as a clerk. The Clary's Grove Boys used to have their cock-fights there, and Lincoln acted as referee. For weeks Bab McNab had been boasting of a young rooster that could whip anything in Sangamon County. But when this fowl was finally put into the pit, he turned tail and refused to fight. Bab, in disgust, grabbed him and tossed him high into the air. The rooster alighted on a pile of firewood near by, then strutted and ruffled up his feathers and crowed defiantly.

“Yes, damn you!” said McNab. “You're great on dressparade, but you are not worth a cuss in a fight.”

Lincoln said that McClellan reminded him of Bab McNab's rooster.

Once, during the Peninsular Campaign, General Magruder with five thousand men held up McClellan with a hundred thousand. McClellan, afraid to attack, threw up breastworks and kept nagging Lincoln for more men, more men, more men.

“If by magic,” said Lincoln, “I could reinforce McClellan with a hundred thousand men, he would go into ecstasy, thank me, and tell me he would go to Richmond to-morrow; but when to-morrow came, he would telegraph that he had certain information that the enemy had four hundred thousand men and that he could not advance without reinforcements.”

“If McClellan had a million men,” said Stanton, Secretary of War, “he would swear that the enemy had two million, and then sit down in the mud and yell for three million.”

“The Young Napoleon” had bounded into fame with one leap, and it had gone to his head like champagne. His egotism was boundless. He described Lincoln and his Cabinet as “hounds”... “wretches”... “some of the greatest geese I have ever seen.”

He was positively insulting to Lincoln; and when the President came to see him, McClellan kept him waiting for half an hour in the anteroom.

Once the general got home at eleven o'clock at night and his servant informed him that Lincoln had been waiting there for hours to see him. McClellan passed the door of the room where the President sat, ignored him, went on upstairs, and sent down word that he had gone to bed.

The newspapers played up incidents like these, and they became the gossip and scandal of Washington. With tears rolling down her cheeks, Mrs. Lincoln implored the President to remove “that awful wind-bag,” as she called him.

“Mother,” he replied, “I know he doesn't do right, but I mustn't consider my feelings at a time like this. I am willing to hold McClellan's hat, if he will only bring us victories.”




The summer drifted into autumn; autumn passed into winter; spring was almost at hand; and still McClellan did nothing but drill men and have dress-parades, and talk.

The nation was aroused, and Lincoln was being condemned and criticized on all sides for McClellan's inaction.

“Your delay is ruining us,” cried Lincoln, as he issued an official order for an advance.

McClellan had to move now or resign. So he rushed to Harper's Ferry, ordering his troops to follow immediately. He planned to invade Virginia from that point, after bridging the Potomac with boats which were to be brought through the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. But, at the last moment, the whole project had to be abandoned because the boats were six inches too wide to float through the canal locks.

When McClellan told Lincoln of this fiasco and said that the pontoons were not ready, the patient, long-suffering President lost his temper at last; and, lapsing into the phraseology of the hay-fields of Pigeon Creek Valley, Indiana, he demanded, “Why, in the hell, ain't they ready?”

The nation was asking the same question in about the same tone.

At last, in April, “the Young Napoleon” made a grand speech to his soldiers, as the older Napoleon used to do, and then started off with one hundred and twenty thousand men singing “The Girl I Left Behind Me.”

The war had been going on for a year. McClellan boasted that he was going to clean up the whole thing now, at once, and let the boys get home in time to plant a little late corn and millet.

Incredible as it seems, Lincoln and Stanton were so optimistic that they wired the governors of the various States to accept no more volunteers, to close the recruiting-places, and to sell the public property belonging to these organizations.

One of the military maxims of Frederick the Great was: “Know the man you are fighting.” Lee and Stonewall Jackson appreciated full well the kind of a weak-kneed Napoleon they had to deal with—a timid, cautious, whining Napoleon who was never on the battle-field, because he couldn't endure the sight of blood.

So Lee let him spend three months crawling up to Richmond. McClellan got so close that his men could hear the clocks in the church towers striking the hour.

Then the inspired Lee crashed upon him in a series of terrific onslaughts, and, in seven days, forced him back to the shelter of his gunboats and killed fifteen thousand of his men.

Thus the “en grande affair,” as McClellan called it, ended in one of the bloodiest failures of the war.

But, as usual, McClellan blamed it all on “those traitors in Washington.” The old story: they hadn't sent him enough men. Their “cowardice and folly” made his “blood boil.” He hated Lincoln and the Cabinet, now, more than he despised the Confederates. He denounced their actions as “the most infamous thing history has ever recorded.”

McClellan had more troops than his enemies—usually far more. He was never able to use at one time all that he then possessed. But he kept on demanding more. More. He asked for an additional ten thousand, then for fifty thousand, finally for a hundred thousand. They were not to be had. He knew it, and Lincoln knew that he knew it. Lincoln told him his demands were “simply absurd.”

McClellan's telegrams to Stanton and the President were fiery and insulting. They sounded like the ravings of a madman. They accused Lincoln and Stanton of doing their best to destroy his army. They made charges so grave that the telegraph operator refused to deliver them.

The nation was appalled, Wall Street was seized with panic, the country was submerged in gloom.

Lincoln grew thin and haggard. “I am as nearly inconsolable,” he said, “as one can be and live.”

McClellan's father-in-law and chief of staff, P. B. Marcy, said there was nothing to do now but capitulate.

When Lincoln heard this, he flushed with anger, sent for Marcy, and said:

“General, I understand you have used the word ‘capitulate.’ That is a word not to be used in connection with our army.”





20


Lincoln had learned, back in New Salem, that it was easy to rent a building and stock it with groceries; but to make it pay required qualities which neither he nor his drunken partner possessed.

He was destined to discover, through years of heartbreak and bloodshed, that it was easy to get a half million soldiers who were willing to die, and a hundred million dollars to equip them with rifles and bullets and blankets; but to win victories required a kind of leadership which it was almost impossible to find.

“How much in military matters,” exclaimed Lincoln, “depends on one master mind!”

So, time and again, he went down on his knees, asking the Almighty to send him a Robert E. Lee or a Joseph E. Johnston or a Stonewall Jackson.

“Jackson,” he said, “is a brave, honest, Presbyterian soldier. If we only had such a man to lead the armies of the North, the country would not be appalled with so many disasters.”

But where in all the Union forces was another Stonewall Jackson to be found? Nobody knew. Edmund Clarence Stedman published a famous poem every verse of which ended with the plea, “Abraham Lincoln, give us a Man.”

It was more than the refrain of a poem. It was the cry of a bleeding and distraught nation.

The President wept as he read it.

For two years he tried to find the leader for whom the nation was crying. He would give the army to one general who would lead it to futile slaughter, and set ten or thirty or forty thousand widows and orphans weeping and wailing throughout the land. Then this discredited commander would be relieved; and another, equally inept, would try his hand and get ten thousand more slaughtered; and Lincoln, clad in dressing-gown and carpet-slippers, would pace the floor all night as the reports came in, crying over and over:

“My God! What will the country say? My God! What will the country say?”

Then another general would assume command, and the futile slaughter would go on.

Some military critics now hold that McClellan, with all his astounding faults and amazing incapacity, was probably the best commander the Army of the Potomac ever had. So imagine, if you can, what the others must have been!

After McClellan's failure, Lincoln tried John Pope. Pope had done splendid work out in Missouri, had captured an island in the Mississippi and several thousand men.

He was like McClellan in two ways: he was handsome, and he was boastful. He declared that his headquarters was “in the saddle;” and he issued so many bombastic announcements that he was soon called “Proclamation Pope.”

“I have come to you from the West, where we have always seen the backs of our enemies.” With that blunt, tactless sentence, he opened his first address to the army. He then proceeded to rebuke the troops for their inaction in the East, and insinuated that they were infernal cowards; and ended by boasting of the military miracles he would perform.

This proclamation made the new commander about as popular as a diamond-backed rattlesnake in dog-days: officers and men alike detested him.

McClellan's hatred for him was intense. Pope had come to take his place. Nobody realized that better than did McClellan—he was already writing for a position in New York—and he was consumed with jealousy, was bitter with envy and resentment.

Pope led the army into Virginia; a great battle was imminent; he needed every man he could get; so Lincoln showered McClellan with telegrams, ordering him to rush his men to Pope's aid with all possible celerity.

But did McClellan obey? He did not. He argued, he delayed, he protested, he telegraphed excuses, he recalled corps that he had sent ahead, and he “exhausted all the resources of a diabolical ingenuity in order to keep Pope from receiving reinforcements.” “Let Mr. Pope,” said he, contemptuously, “get out of his own scrape.”

Even after he heard the roar of the Confederate artillery, he still managed to keep thirty thousand of his troops from going to the aid of his obnoxious rival.

So Lee overwhelmed Pope's army on the old battle-field of Bull Run. The slaughter was terrible. The Federal soldiers again fled in a panic.

It was the story of the first Bull Run over again: once more a bloody and beaten mob poured into Washington.

Lee pursued them with his victorious troops. And even Lincoln believed the capital was lost. Gunboats were ordered up the river, and all the clerks in Washington—civilian and government alike—were called to arms to defend the city.

Stanton, Secretary of War, in a wild panic, telegraphed the governors of half a dozen States, imploring them to send all their militia and volunteer forces by special trains.

Saloons were closed, church bells tolled; men fell on their knees, beseeching Almighty God to save the city.

The old people and the women and children fled in terror. The streets resounded with the hoofs of hurrying horses, with the rattle of carriages dashing away to Maryland.

Stanton, preparing to transfer the Government to New York, ordered the arsenal stripped and all its supplies shipped North.

Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, ordered the nation's silver and gold transferred in feverish haste to the sub-Treasury in Wall Street.

Lincoln, weary and discouraged, exclaimed with a mingled groan and sigh:

“What shall I do?... What shall I do?... The bottom is out of the tub, the bottom is out of the tub.”

People believed that McClellan, in order to get revenge, had longed to see “Mr. Pope” defeated and his army crushed.

Even Lincoln had already called him to the White House and told him that people were accusing him of being a traitor, of wanting to see Washington captured and the South triumphant.

Stanton stormed about in a rage, his face fiery with indignation and hatred. Those who saw him said that if McClellan had walked into the war-office then, Stanton would have rushed at him and knocked him down.

Chase was even more bitter. He didn't want to hit McClellan. He said the man ought to be shot.

And the pious Chase wasn't speaking figuratively. Neither was he exaggerating. He literally wanted McClellan blindfolded, backed up against a stone wall, and a dozen bullets sent crashing through his heart.

But Lincoln, with his understanding nature and Christ-like spirit, condemned no one. True, Pope had failed, but hadn't he done his best? Lincoln, himself, had met defeat too often to blame any one else for failure.

So he sent Pope out to the Northwest to subdue an uprising of Sioux Indians, and gave the army back to McClellan. Why? Because, Lincoln said: “There is no man in the army who can lick these troops of ours into shape half as well as he.... If he can't fight, himself, he excels in making others ready to fight.” The President knew that he would be condemned for restoring “little Mac” to command. And he was—bitterly. Even by his Cabinet. Stanton and Chase actually declared that they would rather have Washington captured by Lee than to see the traitorous and contemptible McClellan given command of the army again.

Lincoln was so hurt at their violent opposition that he said he would resign if the Cabinet wished it.

A few months later, after the Battle of Antietam, McClellan absolutely refused to obey Lincoln's orders to follow Lee and attack him, so the army was taken away from him again; and his military career was ended forever.

The Army of the Potomac must have another leader. But who was he? Where was he? No one knew.

In desperation, Lincoln offered the command to Burnside. He wasn't fit for it, and he knew it. He refused it twice; and, when it was forced upon him, he wept. Then he took the army and made a rash attack on Lee's fortifications at Fredericksburg, and lost thirteen thousand men. Men uselessly butchered, for there wasn't the faintest hope of success.

Officers as well as privates began to desert in large numbers.

So Burnside, in turn, was relieved, and the army given to another braggart, “Fighting Joe” Hooker.

“May God have mercy on Lee,” he vaunted, “for I shall not.”

He led what he called “the finest army on the planet” against Lee. He had twice as many men as the Confederates, but Lee hurled him back across the river at Chancellorsville and destroyed seventeen thousand of his troops.

It was one of the most disastrous defeats of the war.

It occurred in May, 1863; and the President's secretary records that he heard the tramp of Lincoln's feet during all the terrible hours of sleepless nights as he paced up and down his room, crying, “Lost! Lost! All is lost!” Finally, however, he went down to Fredericksburg to cheer up “Fighting Joe” and encourage the army.

Lincoln was denounced bitterly for all this futile slaughter; and gloom and discouragement settled over the nation.

And quickly on top of these military sorrows, came a domestic tragedy. Lincoln was inordinately fond of his two little sons, Tad and Willie. He often stole away, on a summer evening, to play “town ball” with them, his coat-tails flying out behind him as he ran from base to base. Sometimes, he would shoot marbles with them all the way from the White House to the war-office. At night he loved to get down on the floor and roll and romp with them. On bright, warm days he would sometimes go out back of the White House and play with the boys and their two goats.

Tad and Willie kept the White House in an uproar, organizing minstrel shows, putting the servants through military drill, running in and out among the office-seekers. If they took a fancy to a certain applicant, they would see that he got in to see “Old Abe” immediately. If they couldn't get him in the front way, they knew of back entrances.

With as little respect for ceremony and precedent as their father had, they dashed in and interrupted a Cabinet meeting once to inform the President that the cat in the basement had just had kittens.

On another occasion the stern Salmon P. Chase was irritated and disgusted because Tad climbed all over his father and finally perched on his shoulder and sat astride of his neck while Chase was discussing the grave financial situation that confronted the country.

Some one gave Willie a pony. He insisted on riding it in all kinds of winter weather; so he got wet and chilled and came down with a severe cold. Soon it had become a serious fever. Night after night Lincoln sat for hours by his bedside; and when the little fellow passed away, his father, choking with sobs, cried:

“My poor boy! My poor boy! He was too good for this earth. God has called him home. It is hard, hard to have him die.”

Mrs. Keckley, who was in the room at the time, says:

He buried his head in his hands, and his tall frame was convulsed with emotion.... The pale face of her dead boy threw Mrs. Lincoln into convulsions. She was so completely overwhelmed with sorrow she did not attend the funeral.

After Willie's death Mrs. Lincoln could not bear to look upon his picture. Mrs. Keckley tells us:

She could not bear the sight of anything he loved, not even a flower. Costly bouquets were presented to her, but she turned from them with a shudder, and either placed them in a room where she could not see them, or threw them out of the window. She gave away all of Willie's toys... and, after his death, she never again crossed the threshold of the Guests' Room in which he died or the Green Room in which he was embalmed.

In a frenzy of grief Mrs. Lincoln called in a so-called spiritualist who masqueraded under the title of “Lord Colchester.” This unmitigated impostor was exposed later and ordered out of town under a threat of imprisonment. But Mrs. Lincoln, in her distress, received “Lord Colchester” in the White House; and there, in a darkened room, she was persuaded that the scratching on the wainscoting, the tapping on the wall, and the rapping of the table, were loving messages from her lost boy.

She wept as she received them.

Lincoln, prostrate with grief, sank into a listless despair. He could hardly discharge his public duties. Letters, telegrams lay on his desk unanswered. His physician feared that he might never rally, that he might succumb entirely to his desolation.

The President would sometimes sit and read aloud for hours, with only his secretary or his aide for an audience. Generally it was Shakspere he read. One day he was reading “King John” to his aide, and when he came to the passage in which Constance bewails her lost boy, Lincoln closed the book, and repeated these words from memory:

And, father cardinal, I have heard you say

That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:

If that be true, I shall see my boy again.

“Colonel, did you ever dream of a lost friend,” the President asked, “and feel that you were holding sweet communion with him, and yet have a sad consciousness that it was not a reality? I often dream of my boy Willie like that.” And dropping his head on the table, Lincoln sobbed aloud.





21


When Lincoln turned to his Cabinet, he found there the same quarrels and jealousy that existed in the army.

Seward, Secretary of State, regarded himself as the “Premier,” snubbed the rest of the Cabinet, meddled in their affairs, and aroused deep resentment.

Chase, Secretary of the Treasury, despised Seward; detested General McClellan; hated Stanton, Secretary of War; and loathed Blair, the Postmaster-General.

Blair, in turn, went around “kicking over beehives,” as Lincoln put it, and boasting that when he “went in for a fight” he “went in for a funeral.” He denounced Seward as “an unprincipled liar,” and refused to have any dealings with him whatever; and as for Stanton and Chase, he wouldn't condescend even to speak to those scoundrels—not even at a Cabinet meeting.

Blair went in for so many fights that finally he went in for his own funeral—as far as politics were concerned. The hatred that he aroused was so fiery and widespread that Lincoln had to ask him to resign.

There was hatred everywhere in the Cabinet.

The Vice-President, Hannibal Hamlin, wouldn't speak to Gideon Welles, Secretary of the Navy; and Welles, topped with an elaborate wig and decorated with a vast growth of white whiskers, kept a diary, and from almost every page of it, he “hurls the shafts of his ridicule and contempt” at well-nigh all his colleagues.

Welles especially detested Grant, Seward, and Stanton.

And as for the violent, insolent Stanton, he was the most prodigious hater of all. He despised Chase, Welles, Blair, Mrs. Lincoln, and apparently almost every one else in creation.

“He cared nothing for the feeling of others,” wrote Grant, “and it gave him more pleasure to refuse a request than to grant it.”

Sherman's hatred for the man was so fierce that he humiliated Stanton on a reviewing-stand before a vast audience, and rejoiced about it ten years later as he wrote his Memoirs.

“As I approached Mr. Stanton,” says Sherman, “he offered me his hand, but I declined it publicly, and the fact was universally noticed.”

Few men who ever lived have been more savagely detested than Stanton.




Almost every man in the Cabinet considered himself superior to Lincoln.

After all, who was this crude, awkward, story-telling Westerner they were supposed to serve under?

A political accident, a “dark horse” that had got in by chance and crowded them out.

Bates, the Attorney-General, had entertained high hopes of being nominated for President, himself, in 1860; and he wrote in his diary that the Republicans made a “fatal blunder” in nominating Lincoln, a man who “lacks will and purpose,” and “has not the power to command.”

Chase, too, had hoped to be nominated instead of Lincoln; and, to the end of his life, he regarded Lincoln with “a sort of benevolent contempt.”

Seward also was bitter and resentful. “Disappointment? You speak to me of disappointment,” he once exclaimed to a friend as he paced the floor, “to me who was justly entitled to the Republican nomination for the Presidency and who had to stand aside and see it given to a little Illinois lawyer!

“You speak to me of disappointment!”

Seward knew that if it hadn't been for Horace Greeley, he himself would have been President. He knew how to run things, he had had twenty years of experience in handling the vast affairs of state.

But what had Lincoln ever run? Nothing except a log-cabin grocery store in New Salem, and he had “run that in the ground.”

Oh, yes, and he had had a post-office once, which he carried around in his hat.

That was the extent of the executive experience of this “prairie politician.”

And now here he sat, blundering and confused, in the White House, letting things drift, doing nothing, while the country was on a greased chute headed straight for disaster.

Seward believed—and thousands of others believed—that he had been made Secretary of State in order to rule the nation, that Lincoln was to be a mere figurehead. People called Seward the Prime Minister. He liked it. He believed that the salvation of the United States rested with him and him alone.

“I will try,” he said when accepting his appointment, “to save freedom and my country.”

Before Lincoln had been in office five weeks Seward sent him a memorandum that was presumptuous. Amazing. It was more than that. It was positively insulting. Never before in the history of the nation had a Cabinet member sent such an impudent, arrogant document to a President.

“We are at the end of a month's administration,” Seward began, “and yet without a policy either domestic or foreign.” Then with a calm assumption of superior wisdom, he proceeded to criticize this ex-grocery, store keeper from New Salem and inform him how the Government ought to be run.

He ended by brazenly suggesting that from now on Lincoln ought to sit in the background where he belonged, and let the suave Seward assume control and prevent the country from going to hell.

One of Seward's suggestions was so wild and erratic as to stun Lincoln. Seward didn't like the way France and Spain had been carrying on lately in Mexico. So he proposed to call them to account. Yes, and Great Britain and Russia, too. And if “satisfactory explanations are not received—” what do you suppose he intended to do?

Declare war. Yes. One war wasn't enough for this statesman. He was going to have a nice little assortment of wars going full blast at the same time.

He did prepare an arrogant note which he proposed sending to England—a note bristling with warnings, threats, and insults. If Lincoln hadn't deleted the worst passages and toned the others down, it might have caused war.

Seward took a pinch of snuff and declared that he would love to see a European power interfere in favor of South Carolina, for then the North would “pitch into that power,” and all the Southern States would help fight the foreign foe.

And it very nearly became necessary to fight England. A Northern gunboat held up a British mail-steamer on the high seas, took off two Confederate commissioners destined for England and France, and lodged them behind prison bars in Boston.

England began preparing for war, shipped thousands of troops across the Atlantic, landed them in Canada, and was ready to attack the North.

Although Lincoln admitted it was “the bitterest pill he had ever swallowed,” nevertheless he had to surrender the Confederate commissioners and apologize.

Lincoln was utterly astounded by some of Seward's wild ideas. From the outset Lincoln had keenly realized that he, himself, was inexperienced in handling the vast and cruel responsibilities that confronted him. He needed help—and wisdom, and guidance. He had appointed Seward hoping to get just that. And see what had happened!

All Washington was talking about Seward's running the administration. It touched Mrs. Lincoln's pride, and aroused her boiling wrath. With fire in her eye, she urged her humble husband to assert himself.

“I may not rule myself,” Lincoln assured her, “but certainly Seward shall not. The only ruler I have is my conscience and my God and these men will have to learn that yet.”

The time came when all of them did.




Salmon P. Chase was the Chesterfield of the Cabinet: strikingly handsome, six feet two inches tall, looking the part of a man born to rule, cultured, a classical scholar, master of three languages, and father of one of the most charming and popular hostesses in Washington society. Frankly, he was shocked to see a man in the White House who didn't know how to order a dinner.

Chase was pious, very pious: he attended church three times on Sunday, quoted the Psalms in his bathtub, and put the motto “In God We Trust” on our national coins. Reading his Bible and a book of sermons every night before retiring, he was utterly unable to comprehend a President who took to bed with him a volume of Artemus Ward or Petroleum Nasby.

Lincoln's flair for humor, at almost all times and under nearly all circumstances, irritated and annoyed Chase.

One day an old crony of Lincoln's from Illinois called at the White House. The doorkeeper, looking him over with a critical eye, announced that the President couldn't be seen, that a Cabinet meeting was in session.

“That don't make no difference,” the caller protested. “You just tell Abe that Orlando Kellogg is here and wants to tell him the story of the stuttering justice. He'll see me.”

Lincoln ordered him shown in at once, and greeted him with a fervent handshake. Turning to the Cabinet, the President said:

“Gentlemen: This is my old friend, Orlando Kellogg, and he wants to tell us the story of the stuttering justice. It is a very good story, so let's lay all business aside now.”

So grave statesmen and the affairs of the nation waited while Orlando told his yarn and Lincoln had his loud guffaw.

Chase was disgusted. He feared for the future of the nation. He complained that Lincoln “was making a joke out of the war,” that he was hurrying the country on to “the abyss of bankruptcy and ruin.”

Chase was as jealous as a member of a high-school sorority. He had expected to be made Secretary of State. Why hadn't he? Why had he been snubbed? Why had the post of honor gone to the haughty Seward? Why had he been made a mere Secretary of the Treasury? He was bitter and resentful.

He had to play third fiddle now. Yes, but he would show them; 1864 was coming. There would be another election then, and he was determined to occupy the White House himself after that. He thought of little else now. He threw his whole heart and soul into what Lincoln called “Chase's mad hunt for the Presidency.”

To Lincoln's face, he pretended to be his friend. But the moment he was out of sight and out of hearing, Chase was the President's ceaseless, bitter, and sneaking foe. Lincoln was frequently compelled to make decisions that offended influential people. When he did, Chase hurried to the disgruntled victim, sympathized with him, assured him that he was right, whipped up his resentment toward Lincoln, and persuaded him that if Salmon P. Chase had been running things he would have been treated fairly.

“Chase is like the blue-bottle fly,” said Lincoln; “he lays his eggs in every rotten place he can find.”

For months Lincoln knew all of this; but with a magnanimous disregard of his own rights, he said:

“Chase is a very able man, but on the subject of the Presidency, I think he is a little insane. He has not behaved very well lately, and people say to me, ‘Now is the time to crush him out.’ Well, I'm not in favor of crushing anybody out. If there is anything that a man can do and do it well, I say, let him do it. So I am determined, so long as he does his duty as head of the Treasury Department, to shut my eyes to his attack of the White House fever.”

But the situation grew steadily worse. When things didn't go Chase's way, he sent in his resignation. He did this five times, and Lincoln went to him and praised him and persuaded him to resume his duties. But finally even the long-suffering Lincoln had enough of it. There had now developed such ill feeling between them that it was unpleasant for them to meet each other. So the next time, the President took Chase at his word and accepted his resignation.

Chase was amazed. His bluff had been called.

The Senate Committee on Finance hurried to the White House in a body. They protested. Chase's going would be a misfortune, a calamity. Lincoln listened, and let them talk themselves out. He then related his painful experiences with Chase; said that Chase always wanted to rule, and resented his (Lincoln's) authority.

“He is either determined to annoy me,” said Lincoln, “or that I shall pat him on the shoulder and coax him to stay. I don't think I ought to do it. I will take him at his word. His usefulness as a Cabinet officer is at an end. I will no longer continue the association. I am willing, if necessary, to resign the office of President. I would rather go back to a farm in Illinois and earn my bread with a plow and an ox than to endure any longer the state I have been in.”

But what was Lincoln's estimate of the man who had humiliated and insulted him? “Of all the great men I have ever known, Chase is equal to about one and a half of the best of them.”

Despite all the ill feeling that had been stirred up, Lincoln then performed one of the most beautiful and magnanimous acts of his career. He conferred upon Chase one of the highest honors a President of the United States can bestow: he made him Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court.




Chase, however, was a docile kitten in comparison with the stormy Stanton. Short, heavy-set, with the build of a bull, Stanton had something of that animal's fierceness and ferocity.

All his life he had been rash and erratic. His father, a physician, hung a human skeleton in the barn where the boy played, hoping that he too would become a doctor. The young Stanton lectured to his playmates about the skeleton, Moses, hell fire, and the flood; and then went off to Columbus, Ohio, and became a clerk in a book-store. He boarded in a private family, and one morning shortly after he left the house, the daughter of the family fell ill with cholera, and was dead and in her grave when Stanton came home for supper that night.

He refused to believe it.

Fearing that she had been buried alive, he hurried to the cemetery, found a spade, and worked furiously for hours, digging up her body.

Years later, driven to despair by the death of his own daughter, Lucy, he had her body exhumed after she had been buried thirteen months, and kept her corpse in his bedroom for more than a year.

When Mrs. Stanton died, he put her nightcap and nightgown beside him in bed each night and wept over them.

He was a strange man. Some people said that he was half crazy.

Lincoln and Stanton had first met during the trial of a patent case in which they, together with George Harding of Philadelphia, had been retained as counsel for the defendant. Lincoln had studied the case minutely, had prepared with extraordinary care and industry, and wanted to speak. But Stanton and Harding were ashamed of him; they brushed him aside with contempt, humiliated him, and refused to let him say a word at the trial.

Lincoln gave them a copy of his speech, but they were sure it was “trash” and didn't bother to look at it.

They wouldn't walk with Lincoln to and from the courthouse; they wouldn't invite him to their rooms; they wouldn't even sit at a table and eat with him. They treated him as a social outcast.

Stanton said—and Lincoln heard him say it:

“I will not associate with such a damned, gawky, long-armed ape as that. If I can't have a man who is a gentleman in appearance with me in the case, I will abandon it.”

“I have never before been so brutally treated as by that man Stanton,” Lincoln said. He returned home, mortified, sunk once more in terrible melancholy.

When Lincoln became President, Stanton's contempt and disgust for him deepened and increased. He called him “a painful imbecile,” declared that he was utterly incapable of running the Government, and that he ought to be ousted by a military dictator. Stanton repeatedly remarked that Du Chaillu was a fool to run off to Africa, looking for a gorilla, when the original gorilla was, at that moment, sitting in the White House scratching himself.

In his letters to Buchanan, Stanton abused the President in language so violent that it can't be put into print.




After Lincoln had been in office ten months, a national scandal reverberated throughout the land. The Government was being robbed! Millions lost! Profiteers! Dishonest war contracts! And so on.

In addition to that, Lincoln and Simon Cameron, Secretary of War, differed sharply on the question of arming slaves.

Lincoln asked Cameron to resign. He must have a new man to run the War Department. Lincoln knew that the future of the nation might depend upon his choice. He also knew precisely the man he needed. So Lincoln said to a friend:

“I have made up my mind to sit down on all my pride—it may be a portion of my self-respect—and appoint Stanton Secretary of War.”

That proved to be one of the wisest appointments Lincoln ever made.

Stanton stood at his desk in the war-office, a regular tornado in trousers, surrounded by clerks trembling like Eastern slaves before their pasha. Working day and night, refusing to go home, eating and sleeping in the war-office, he was filled with wrath and indignation by the loafing, swaggering, incompetent officers that infested the army.

And he fired them right and left and backward and forward.

Cursing and swearing, he insulted meddlesome Congressmen. He waged a fierce and relentless war on dishonest contractors; ignored and violated the Constitution; arrested even generals, clapped them into prison and kept them there for months without trial. He lectured McClellan as if he were drilling a regiment, declared that he must fight. He swore that “the champagne and oysters on the Potomac must stop;” seized all the railroads; commandeered all the telegraph lines, made Lincoln send and receive his telegrams through the war-office; assumed command of all the armies, and wouldn't let even an order from Grant pass through the adjutant-general's office without his approval.

For years Stanton had been racked with head pains, had suffered from asthma and indigestion.

However, he was driven like a dynamo by one absorbing passion: to hack and stab and shoot until the South came back into the Union.

Lincoln could endure anything to achieve that goal.

One day a Congressman persuaded the President to give him an order transferring certain regiments. Rushing to the waroffice with the order, he put it on Stanton's desk; and Stanton said very sharply that he would do no such thing.

“But,” the politician protested, “you forget I have an order here from the President.”

“If the President gave you such an order,” Stanton retorted, “he is a damned fool.”

The Congressman rushed back to Lincoln, expecting to see him rise up in wrath and dismiss the Secretary of War.

But Lincoln listened to the story, and said with a twinkle in his eye: “If Stanton said I was a damned fool, then I must be, for he is nearly always right. I'll just step over and see him myself.”




He did, and Stanton convinced him that his order was wrong and Lincoln withdrew it.

Realizing that Stanton bitterly resented interference, Lincoln usually let him have his way.

“I cannot add to Mr. Stanton's troubles,” he said. “His position is the most difficult in the world. Thousands in the army blame him because they are not promoted, and other thousands blame him because they are not appointed. The pressure upon him is immeasurable and unending. He is the rock on the beach of our national ocean against which the breakers dash and roar, dash and roar without ceasing. He fights back the angry waters and prevents them from undermining and overwhelming the land. I do not see how he survives, why he is not crushed and torn to pieces. Without him, I should be destroyed.”

Occasionally, however, the President “put his foot down,” as he called it; and then—look out. If “Old Mars” said then that he wouldn't do a thing, Lincoln would reply very quietly: “I reckon, Mr. Secretary, you'll have to do it.”

And done it was.

On one occasion he wrote an order saying: “Without an if or an and or but, let Colonel Elliott W. Rice be made Brigadier-General in the United States army—Abraham Lincoln.”

On another occasion he wrote Stanton to appoint a certain man “regardless of whether he knows the color of Julius Caesar's hair or not.”

In the end Stanton and Seward and most of those who began by reviling and scorning Abraham Lincoln learned to revere him.

When Lincoln lay dying in a rooming-house across the street from Ford's Theater, the iron Stanton, who had once denounced him as “a painful imbecile,” said, “There lies the most perfect ruler of men the world has ever seen.”

John Hay, one of Lincoln's secretaries, has graphically described Lincoln's manner of working in the White House:

He was extremely unmethodical. It was a four years' struggle on Nicolay's part and mine to get him to adopt some systematic rules. He would break through every regulation as fast as it was made. Anything that kept the people themselves away from him, he disapproved, although they nearly annoyed the life out of him by unreasonable complaints and requests.

He wrote very few letters, and did not read one in fifty that he received. At first we tried to bring them to his notice, but at last he gave the whole thing over to me, and signed, without reading them, the letters I wrote in his name.

He wrote perhaps half a dozen a week himself—not more.

When the President had any rather delicate matter to manage at a distance from Washington, he rarely wrote but sent Nicolay or me.

He went to bed ordinarily from ten to eleven o'clock... and rose early. When he lived in the country at the Soldiers' Home, he would be up and dressed, eat his breakfast (which was extremely frugal, an egg, a piece of toast, coffee, etc.) and ride into Washington all before eight o'clock. In the winter, at the White House, he was not quite so early. He did not sleep well, but spent a good while in bed....

At noon he took a biscuit, a glass of milk in winter, some fruit or grapes in summer.... He was abstemious—ate less than any man I know.

He drank nothing but water, not from principle, but because he did not like wine or spirits....

Sometimes he would run away to a lecture or concert or theater for the sake of a little rest....

He read very little. He scarcely ever looked into a newspaper unless I called his attention to an article on some special subject. He frequently said, “I know more about it than any of them.” It is absurd to call him a modest man. No great man was ever modest.





22


Ask the average American citizen to-day why the Civil War was fought; and the chances are that he will reply, “To free the slaves.”

Was it?

Let's see. Here is a sentence taken from Lincoln's first inaugural address: “I have no purpose, directly or indirectly, to interfere with the institution of slavery in the States where it now exists. I believe I have no lawful right to do so, and I have no inclination to do so.”

The fact is that the cannon had been booming and the wounded groaning for almost eighteen months before Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation. During all that time the radicals and the Abolitionists had urged him to act at once, storming at him through the press and denouncing him from the public platform.

Once a delegation of Chicago ministers appeared at the White House with what they declared was a direct command from Almighty God to free the slaves immediately. Lincoln told them that he imagined that if the Almighty had any advice to offer He would come direct to headquarters with it, instead of sending it around via Chicago.

Finally Horace Greeley, irritated by Lincoln's procrastination and inaction, attacked the President in an article entitled, “The Prayer of Twenty Millions.” Two columns bristling with bitter complaints.

Lincoln's answer to Greeley is one of the classics of the war —clear, terse, and vigorous. He closed his reply with these memorable words:

My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves, I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone, I would also do that. What I do about slavery and the colored race, I do because I believe it helps to save the Union; and what I forbear, I forbear because I do not believe it would help to save the Union. I shall do less whenever I shall believe what I am doing hurts the cause, and I shall do more whenever I shall believe doing more will help the cause. I shall try to correct errors when shown to be errors, and I shall adopt new views so fast as they shall appear to be true views.

I have here stated my purpose according to my view of official duty; and I intend no modification of my oftexpressed personal wish that all men everywhere could be free.

Lincoln believed that if he saved the Union and kept slavery from spreading, slavery would, in due time, die a natural death. But if the Union were destroyed, it might persist for centuries.

Four slave States had remained with the North, and Lincoln realized that if he issued his Emancipation Proclamation too early in the conflict he would drive them into the Confederacy, strengthen the South, and perhaps destroy the Union forever. There was a saying at the time that “Lincoln would like to have God Almighty on his side; but he must have Kentucky.”

So he bided his time, and moved cautiously.

He himself had married into a slave-owning, border-State family. Part of the money that his wife received upon the settlement of her father's estate had come from the sale of slaves. And the only really intimate friend that he ever had—Joshua Speed—was a member of a slave-owning family. Lincoln sympathized with the Southern point of view. Besides, he had the attorney's traditional respect for the Constitution and for law and property. He wanted to work no hardships on any one.

He believed that the North was as much to blame for the existence of slavery in the United States as was the South; and that in getting rid of it, both sections should bear the burden equally. So he finally worked out a plan that was very near to his heart. According to this, the slave-owners in the loyal border States were to receive four hundred dollars for each of their negroes. The slaves were to be emancipated gradually, very gradually. The process was not to be entirely completed until January 1, 1900. Calling the representatives of the border States to the White House, he pleaded with them to accept his proposal.

“The change it contemplates,” Lincoln argued, “would come gently as the dews of heaven, not rending or wrecking anything. Will you not embrace it? So much good has not been done, by one effort, in all past time, as, in the providence of God, it is now your high privilege to do. May the vast future not have to lament you have neglected it.”

But they did neglect it, and rejected the whole scheme. Lincoln was immeasurably disappointed.

“I must save this Government, if possible,” he said; “and it may as well be understood, once for all, that I shall not surrender this game, leaving any available card unplayed.... I believe that freeing the slaves and arming the blacks has now become an indispensable military necessity. I have been driven to the alternative of either doing that or surrendering the Union.”

He had to act at once, for both France and England were on the verge of recognizing the Confederacy. Why? The reasons were very simple.

Take France's case first. Napoleon III had married Marie Eugénie de Montijo, Comtesse de Teba, reputed to be the most beautiful woman in the world, and he wanted to show off a bit. He longed to cover himself with glory, as his renowned uncle, Napoleon Bonaparte, had done. So when he saw the States slashing and shooting at one another, and knew they were much too occupied to bother about enforcing the Monroe Doctrine, he ordered an army to Mexico, shot a few thousand natives, conquered the country, called Mexico a French empire, and put the Archduke Maximilian on the throne.

Napoleon believed, and not without reason, that if the Confederates won they would favor his new empire; but that if the Federals won, the United States would immediately take steps to put the French out of Mexico. It was Napoleon's wish, therefore, that the South would make good its secession, and he wanted to help it as much as he conveniently could.

At the outset of the war, the Northern navy closed all Southern ports, guarded 189 harbors and patrolled 9,614 miles of coast line, sounds, bayous, and rivers.

It was the most gigantic blockade the world had ever seen.

The Confederates were desperate. They couldn't sell their cotton; neither could they buy guns, ammunition, shoes, medical supplies, or food. They boiled chestnuts and cotton-seed to make a substitute for coffee, and brewed a decoction of blackberry leaves and sassafras root to take the place of tea. Newspapers were printed on wall-paper. The earthen floors of smokehouses, saturated with the drippings of bacon, were dug up and boiled to get salt. Church bells were melted and cast into cannon. Street-car rails in Richmond were torn up to be made into gunboat armor.

The Confederates couldn't repair their railroads or buy new equipment, so transportation was almost at a standstill; corn that could be purchased for two dollars a bushel in Georgia, brought fifteen dollars in Richmond. People in Virginia were going hungry.

Something had to be done at once. So the South offered to give Napoleon III twelve million dollars' worth of cotton if he would recognize the Confederacy and use the French fleet to lift the blockade. Besides, they promised to overwhelm him with orders that would start smoke rolling out of every factory chimney in France night and day.

Napoleon therefore urged Russia and England to join him in recognizing the Confederacy. The aristocracy that ruled England adjusted their monocles, poured a few drinks of Johnny Walker, and listened eagerly to Napoleon's overtures. The United States was getting too rich and powerful to please them. They wanted to see the nation divided, the Union broken. Besides, they needed the South's cotton. Scores of England's factories had closed, and a million people were not only idle but destitute and reduced to actual pauperism. Children were crying for food; hundreds of people were dying of starvation. Public subscriptions to buy food for British workmen were taken up in the remotest corners of the earth: even in far-off India and povertystricken China.

There was one way, and only one way, that England could get cotton, and that was to join Napoleon III in recognizing the Confederacy and lifting the blockade.

If that were done, what would happen in America? The South would get guns, powder, credit, food, railroad equipment, and a tremendous lift in confidence and morale.

And what would the North get? Two new and powerful enemies. The situation, bad enough now, would be hopeless then.

Nobody knew this better than Abraham Lincoln. “We have about played our last card,” he confessed in 1862. “We must either change our tactics now or lose the game.”

As England saw it, all the colonies had originally seceded from her. Now the Southern colonies had, in turn, seceded from the Northern ones; and the North was fighting to coerce and subdue them. What difference did it make to a lord in London or a prince in Paris whether Tennessee and Texas were ruled from Washington or Richmond? None. To them, the fighting was meaningless and fraught with no high purpose.

“No war ever raging in my time,” wrote Carlyle, “was to me more profoundly foolish looking.”

Lincoln saw that Europe's attitude toward the war must be changed, and he knew how to do it. A million people in Europe had read “Uncle Tom's Cabin—” had read it and wept and learned to abhor the heartaches and injustice of slavery. So Abraham Lincoln knew that if he issued his Proclamation of Emancipation, Europeans would see the war in a different light. It would no longer be a bloody quarrel over the preservation of a Union that meant nothing to them. Instead, it would be exalted into a holy crusade to destroy slavery. European governments would then not dare to recognize the South. Public opinion wouldn't tolerate the aiding of a people supposed to be fighting to perpetuate human bondage.

Finally, therefore, in July, 1862, Lincoln determined to issue his proclamation; but McClellan and Pope had recently led the army to humiliating defeats. Seward told the President that the time was not auspicious, that he ought to wait and launch the proclamation on the crest of a wave of victory.

That sounded sensible. So Lincoln waited; and two months later the victory came. Then Lincoln called his Cabinet together to discuss the issuing of the most famous document in American history since the Declaration of Independence.

It was a momentous occasion—and a grave one. But did Lincoln act gravely and solemnly? He did not. Whenever he came across a good story, he liked to share it. He used to take one of Artemus Ward's books to bed with him; and when he read something humorous, he would get up, and, clad in nothing but his night-shirt, he would make his way through the halls of the White House to the office of his secretaries, and read it to them.

The day before the Cabinet meeting which was to discuss the issuing of the Emancipation Proclamation, Lincoln had gotten hold of Ward's latest volume. There was a story in it that he thought very funny. So he read it to the Cabinet now, before they got down to business. It was entitled, “High-handed Outrage in Utiky.”

After Lincoln had had his laugh, he put the book aside and began solemnly: “When the rebel army was at Frederick, I determined, as soon as it should be driven out of Maryland, to issue a proclamation of emancipation. I said nothing to any one, but I made the promise to myself and—to my Maker. The rebel army is now driven out, and I am going to fulfil that promise. I have called you together to hear what I have written down. I do not wish your advice upon the main matter, for that I have determined for myself. What I have written is that which my reflections have determined me to say. But if there is anything in the expressions I use, or in any minor matter, which any of you thinks had best be changed, I shall be glad to receive the suggestions.”

Seward suggested one slight change in wording; then, a few minutes later, he proposed another.

Lincoln asked him why he hadn't made both suggestions at the same time. And then Lincoln interrupted the consideration of the Emancipation Proclamation to tell a story. He said a hired man back in Indiana told the farmer who had employed him that one steer in his best yoke of oxen had died. Having waited a while, the hired man said, “The other ox in that team is dead, too.”

“Then why didn't you tell me at once,” asked the farmer, “that both of them were dead?”

“Well,” answered the hired man, “I didn't want to hurt you by telling you too much at the same time.”

Lincoln presented the proclamation to his Cabinet in September, 1862; but it was not to take effect until the first day of January, 1863. So when Congress met the following December, Lincoln appealed to that body for support. In making his plea he uttered one of the most magnificent sentences he ever penned —a sentence of unconscious poetry.

Speaking of the Union, he said:

“We shall nobly save or meanly lose

The last, best hope of earth.”

On New Year's Day, 1863, Lincoln spent hours shaking hands with the visitors that thronged the White House. In the middle of that afternoon, he retired to his office, dipped his pen in the ink, and prepared to sign his proclamation of freedom. Hesitating, he turned to Seward and said: “If slavery isn't wrong, nothing is wrong, and I have never felt more certain in my life that I was doing right. But I have been receiving calls and shaking hands since nine o'clock this morning, and my arm is stiff and numb. Now this signature is one that will be closely examined, and if they find my hand trembled, they will say, ‘He had some compunctions.’”

He rested his arm a moment, then slowly signed the document, and gave freedom to three and a half million slaves.

The proclamation did not meet with popular approval then. “The only effect of it,” wrote Orville H. Browning, one of Lincoln's closest friends and strongest supporters, “was to unite and exasperate the South and divide and distract us in the North.”

A mutiny broke out in the army. Men who had enlisted to save the Union swore that they wouldn't stand up and be shot down to free niggers and make them their social equals. Thousands of soldiers deserted, and recruiting fell off everywhere.

The plain people upon whom Lincoln had depended for support failed him utterly. The autumn elections went overwhelmingly against him. Even his home state of Illinois repudiated the Republican party.

And quickly, on top of the defeat at the polls, came one of the most disastrous reverses of the war—Burnside's foolhardy attack on Lee at Fredericksburg and the loss of thirteen thousand men. A stupid and futile butchery. This sort of thing had been going on for eighteen months now. Was it never going to stop? The nation was appalled. People were driven to despair. The President was violently denounced everywhere. He had failed. His general had failed. His policies had failed. People wouldn't put up with this any longer. Even the Republican members of the Senate revolted; and, wanting to force Lincoln out of the White House, they called upon him, demanding that he change his policies and dismiss his entire Cabinet.

This was a humiliating blow. Lincoln confessed that it distressed him more than any other one event of his political life.

“They want to get rid of me,” he said, “and I am half disposed to gratify them.”

Horace Greeley now sharply regretted the fact that he had forced the Republicans to nominate Lincoln in 1860.

“It was a mistake,” he confessed, “the biggest mistake of my life.”

Greeley and a number of other prominent Republicans organized a movement having these objects in view: to force Lincoln to resign, to put Hamlin, the Vice-President, in the White House, and then to compel Hamlin to give Rosecrans command of all the Union armies.

“We are now on the brink of destruction,” Lincoln confessed. “It appears to me that even the Almighty is against us. I can see hardly a ray of hope.”

In the spring of 1863, Lee, flushed with a phenomenal series of brilliant victories, determined to take the offensive and invade the North. He planned to seize the rich manufacturing centers of Pennsylvania, secure food, medicine, and new clothes for his ragged troops, possibly capture Washington, and compel France and Great Britain to recognize the Confederacy.

A bold, reckless move! True, but the Southern troops were boasting that one Confederate could whip three Yankees, and they believed it; so when their officers told them they could eat beef twice a day when they reached Pennsylvania, they were eager to be off at once.

Before he quit Richmond, Lee received disquieting news from home. A terrible thing had happened! One of his daughters had actually been caught reading a novel. The great general was distressed; so he wrote, pleading with her to devote her leisure to such innocuous classics as Plato and Homer, and Plutarch's Lives. After finishing the letter, Lee read his Bible and knelt in prayer, as was his custom; then he blew out the candle and turned in for the night....

Presently he was off with seventy-five thousand men. His hungry army plunged across the Potomac, throwing the country into a panic. Farmers rushed out of the Cumberland Valley, driving their horses and cattle before them; and negroes, their eyes white with fear, fled in terror, lest they be dragged back to slavery.

Lee's artillery was already thundering before Harrisburg, when he learned that, back in the rear, the Union Army was threatening to break his lines of communication. So he whirled around as an angry ox would to gore a dog snapping at his heels; and, quite by chance, the ox and the dog met at a sleepy little Pennsylvania village with a theological seminary, a place called Gettysburg, and fought there the most famous battle in the history of our country.

During the first two days of the fighting the Union Army lost twenty thousand men; and, on the third day, Lee hoped finally to smash the enemy by a terrific assault of fresh troops under the command of General George Pickett.

These were new tactics for Lee. Up to this time, he had fought with his men behind breastworks or concealed in the woods. Now he planned to make a desperate attack out in the open.

The very contemplation of it staggered Lee's most brilliant assistant, General Longstreet.

“Great God!” Longstreet exclaimed. “Look, General Lee, at the insurmountable difficulties between our line and that of the Yankees—the steep hills, the tiers of artillery, the fences. And then we shall have to fight our infantry against their battery. Look at the ground we shall have to charge over, nearly a mile of it there in the open, under the line of their canister and shrapnel. It is my opinion that no fifteen thousand men ever arrayed for battle could take that position.”

But Lee was adamant. “There were never such men in an army before,” he replied. “They will go anywhere and do anything if properly led.”

So Lee held to his decision, and made the bloodiest blunder of his career.

The Confederates had already massed one hundred and fifty cannon along Seminary Ridge. If you visit Gettysburg, you can see them there to-day, placed precisely as they were on that fateful July afternoon when they laid down a barrage such as, up to that time, had never before been heard on earth.

Longstreet in this instance had keener judgment than Lee. He believed that the charge could result in nothing but pointless butchery; so he bowed his head and wept and declined to issue the order. Consequently, another officer had to give the command for him; and, in obedience to that command, General George Pickett led his Southern troops in the most dramatic and disastrous charge that ever occurred in the Western world.

Strangely enough, this general who led the assault on the Union lines was an old friend of Lincoln's. In fact, Lincoln had made it possible for him to go to West Point. He was a picturesque character, this man Pickett. He wore his hair so long that his auburn locks almost touched his shoulders; and, like Napoleon in his Italian campaigns, he wrote ardent love-letters almost daily on the battle-field. His devoted troops cheered him that afternoon as he rode off jauntily toward the Union lines, with his cap set at a rakish angle over his right ear. They cheered and they followed him, man touching man, rank pressing rank, with banners flying and bayonets gleaming in the sun. It was picturesque. Daring. Magnificent. A murmur of admiration ran through the Union lines as they beheld it.

Pickett's troops swept forward at an easy trot, through an orchard and corn-field, across a meadow, and over a ravine. All the time, the enemy's cannon were tearing ghastly holes in their ranks. But on they pressed, grim, irresistible.

Suddenly the Union infantry rose from behind the stone wall on Cemetery Ridge where they had been hiding, and fired volley after volley into Pickett's defenseless troops. The crest of the hill was a sheet of flame, a slaughter-house, a blazing volcano. In a few minutes, all of Pickett's brigade commanders, except one, were down, and four fifths of his five thousand men had fallen.

A thousand fell where Kemper led;

A thousand died where Garnett bled;

In blinding flame and strangling smoke

The remnant through the batteries broke,

And crossed the fine with Armistead.

Armistead, leading the troops in the final plunge, ran forward, vaulted over the stone wall, and, waving his cap on the top of his sword, shouted:

“Give 'em the steel, boys!”

They did. They leaped over the wall, bayoneted their enemies, smashed skulls with clubbed muskets, and planted the battle-flags of the South on Cemetery Ridge.

The banners waved there, however, only for a moment. But that moment, brief as it was, recorded the high-water mark of the Confederacy.

Pickett's charge—brilliant, heroic—was nevertheless the beginning of the end. Lee had failed. He could not penetrate the North. And he knew it.

The South was doomed.

As the remnant of Pickett's bleeding men struggled back from their fatal charge, Lee, entirely alone, rode out to encourage them, and greeted them with a self-condemnation that was little short of sublime.

“All this has been my fault,” he confessed. “It is I who have lost this fight.”




During the night of July 4 Lee began to retreat. Heavy rains were falling, and by the time he reached the Potomac the water was so high that he couldn't cross.

There Lee was, caught in a trap, an impassable river in front of him, a victorious enemy behind him. Meade, it seemed, had him at his mercy. Lincoln was delighted; he was sure the Federal troops would swoop down upon Lee's flank and rear now, rout and capture his men, and bring the war to an abrupt and triumphant close. And if Grant had been there, that is probably what would have happened.

But the vain and scholarly Meade was not the bulldog Grant. Every day for an entire week Lincoln repeatedly urged and commanded Meade to attack, but he was too cautious, too timid. He did not want to fight; he hesitated, he telegraphed excuses, he called a council of war in direct violation of orders—and did nothing, while the waters receded and Lee escaped.

Lincoln was furious.

“What does this mean?” he cried. “Great God! What does this mean? We had them within our grasp, and had only to stretch forth our hands and they were ours; yet nothing that I could say or do could make the army move. Under the circumstances, almost any general could have defeated Lee. If I had gone up there, I could have whipped him, myself.” In bitter disappointment, Lincoln sat down and wrote Meade a letter, in which he said:

My dear General, I do not believe you appreciate the magnitude of the misfortune involved in Lee's escape. He was within our easy grasp, and to have closed upon him would, in connection with our other late successes, have ended the war. As it is, the war will be prolonged indefinitely. If you could not safely attack Lee last Monday, how can you possibly do so south of the river, when you can take with you very few more than two-thirds of the force you then had in hand? It would be unreasonable to expect and I do not expect that you can now effect much. Your golden opportunity is gone, and I am distressed immeasurably because of it.

Lincoln read this letter, and then stared out the window with unseeing eyes, and did a bit of thinking: “If I had been in Meade's place,” he probably mused to himself, “and had had Meade's temperament and the advice of his timid officers, and if I had been awake as many nights as he had, and had seen as much blood, I might have let Lee escape, too.”

The letter was never sent. Meade never saw it. It was found among Lincoln's papers after his death.




The Battle of Gettysburg was fought during the first week of July; six thousand dead and twenty-seven thousand wounded were left on the field. Churches, schools, and barns were turned into hospitals; groans of the suffering filled the air. Scores were dying every hour, corpses were decaying rapidly in the intense heat. The burial parties had to work fast. There was little time to dig graves; so, in many instances, a little dirt was scooped over a body where it lay. After a week of hard rains, many of the dead were half exposed. The Union soldiers were gathered from their temporary graves, and buried in one place. The following autumn the Cemetery Commission decided to dedicate the ground, and invited Edward Everett, the most famous orator in the United States, to deliver the address.

Formal invitations to attend the exercises were sent to the President, to the Cabinet, to General Meade, to all members of both houses of Congress, to various distinguished citizens, and to the members of the diplomatic corps. Very few of these people accepted; many didn't acknowledge the invitation.

The committee had not the least idea that the President would come. In fact, they had not even troubled to write him a personal invitation. He got merely a printed one. They imagined that his secretaries might drop it in the waste-basket without even showing it to Lincoln.

So when he wrote saying he would be present, the committee was astonished. And a bit embarrassed. What should they do? Ask him to speak? Some argued that he was too busy for that, that he couldn't possibly find time to prepare. Others frankly asked, “Well, even if he had the time, has he the ability?” They doubted it.

Oh, yes, he could make a stump speech in Illinois; but speaking at the dedication of a cemetery? No. That was different. That was not Lincoln's style. However, since he was coming anyway, they had to do something. So they finally wrote him, saying that after Mr. Everett had delivered his oration, they would like to have him make “a few appropriate remarks.” That was the way they phrased it—“a few appropriate remarks.”

The invitation just barely missed being an insult. But the President accepted it. Why? There is an interesting story behind that. The previous autumn Lincoln had visited the battle-field of Antietam; and, one afternoon while he and an old friend from Illinois, Ward Lamon, were out driving, the President turned to Lamon and asked him to sing what Lincoln called his “sad little song.” It was one of Lincoln's favorites.

“Many a time, on the Illinois circuit and often at the White House when Lincoln and I were alone,” says Lamon, “I have seen him in tears while I was rendering that homely melody.”

It went like this:

I've wandered to the village, Tom; I've sat beneath the tree

Upon the schoolhouse play-ground, that sheltered you and me;

But none were left to greet me, Tom, and few were left to know

Who played with us upon the green, some twenty years ago.



Near by the spring, upon the elm you know I cut your name,—

Your sweetheart's just beneath it, Tom; and you did mine the same.

Some heartless wretch has peeled the bark—'twas dying sure but slow,

Just as she died whose name you cut, some twenty years ago.



My lids have long been dry, Tom, but tears came to my eyes;

I thought of her I loved so well, those early broken ties:

I visited the old churchyard, and took some flowers to strow

Upon the graves of those we loved, some twenty years ago.

As Lamon sang it now, probably Lincoln fell to dreaming of the only woman he had ever loved, Ann Rutledge, and he thought of her lying back there in her neglected grave on the Illinois prairie; and the rush of these poignant memories filled his eyes with tears. So Lamon, to break the spell of Lincoln's melancholy, struck up a humorous negro melody.

That was all there was to the incident. It was perfectly harmless, and very pathetic. But Lincoln's political enemies distorted it and lied about it and tried to make it a national disgrace. They made it appear like a gross indecency. The New York “World” repeated some version of the scandal every day for almost three months. Lincoln was accused of cracking jokes and singing funny songs on the battle-field where “heavy details of men were engaged in burying the dead.”

The truth is that he had cracked no jokes at all, that he had sung no songs, that he had been miles away from the battlefield when the incident occurred, that the dead had all been buried before that, and rain had fallen upon their graves. Such were the facts. But his enemies didn't want facts. They were lusting for blood. A bitter cry of savage denunciation swept over the land.

Lincoln was deeply hurt. He was so distressed that he could not bear to read these attacks, yet he didn't feel that he ought to answer them, for that would merely dignify them. So he suffered in silence, and when the invitation came to speak at the dedication of the Gettysburg cemetery, he welcomed it. It was just the opportunity he desired to silence his enemies and pay his humble tribute to the honored dead.

The invitation came late, and he had only a crowded fortnight in which to prepare his speech. He thought it over during his spare moments—while dressing, while being shaved, while eating his lunch, while walking back and forth between Stanton's office and the White House. He mused upon it while stretched out on a leather couch in the war-office, waiting for the late telegraphic reports. He wrote a rough draft of it on a piece of pale-blue foolscap paper, and carried it about in the top of his hat. The Sunday before it was delivered he said: “I have written it over two or three times, but it is not finished. I shall have to give it another lick before I am satisfied.”

He arrived in Gettysburg the night before the dedication. The little town was filled to overflowing. Its usual population of thirteen hundred had been swelled to almost thirty thousand. The weather was fine; the night was clear; a bright full moon rode high through the sky. Only a fraction of the crowd could find beds; thousands paraded up and down the village until dawn. The sidewalks soon became clogged, impassable; so hundreds, locked arm in arm, marched in the middle of the dirt streets, singing, “John Brown's body lies a-mouldering in the grave.”

Lincoln devoted all that evening to giving his speech “another lick.” At eleven o'clock he went to an adjoining house, where Secretary Seward was staying, and read the speech aloud to him, asking for his criticisms. The next morning, after breakfast, Lincoln continued working over it until a rap at the door reminded him that it was time for him to take his place in the procession headed for the cemetery.

As the procession started, he sat erect at first; but presently his body slouched forward in the saddle; his head fell on his chest, and his long arms hung limp at his sides.... He was lost in thought, going over his little speech, giving it “another lick.”

Edward Everett, the selected orator of the occasion, made two mistakes at Gettysburg. Both bad—and both uncalled for. First, he arrived an hour late; and, secondly, he spoke for two hours.

Lincoln had read Everett's oration and when he saw that the speaker was nearing his close, he knew his time was coming, and he honestly felt that he wasn't adequately prepared; so he grew nervous, twisted in his chair, drew his manuscript from the pocket of his Prince Albert coat, put on his old-fashioned glasses, and quickly refreshed his memory.

Presently he stepped forward, manuscript in hand, and delivered his little address in two minutes.

Did his audience realize, that soft November afternoon, that they were listening to the greatest speech that had ever fallen from human lips up to that time? No, most of his hearers were merely curious: they had never seen nor heard a President of the United States, they strained their necks to look at Lincoln, and were surprised to discover that such a tall man had such a high, thin voice, and that he spoke with a Southern accent. They had forgotten that he was born a Kentuckian and that he had retained the intonation of his native State; and about the time they felt he was getting through with his introduction and ready to launch into his speech—he sat down.

What! Had he forgotten? Or was it really all he had to say? People were too surprised and disappointed to applaud.

Many a spring, back in Indiana, Lincoln had tried to break ground with a rusty plow; but the soil had stuck to its moldboard, and made a mess. It wouldn't “scour.” That was the term people used. Throughout his life, when Lincoln wanted to indicate that a thing had failed, he frequently resorted to the phraseology of the corn-field. Turning now to Ward Lamon, Lincoln said:

“That speech is a flat failure, Lamon. It won't scour. The people are disappointed.”

He was right. Every one was disappointed, including Edward Everett and Secretary Seward, who were sitting on the platform with the President. They both believed he had failed woefully; and both felt sorry for him.

Lincoln was so distressed that he worried himself into a severe headache; and on the way back to Washington, he had to lie down in the drawing-room of the train and have his head bathed with cold water.

Lincoln went to his grave believing that he had failed utterly at Gettysburg. And he had, as far as the immediate effect of his speech was concerned.

With characteristic modesty, he sincerely felt that the world would “little note nor long remember” what he said there, but that it would never forget what the brave men who died had done there. How surprised he would be if he should come back to life now and realize that the speech of his that most people remember is the one that didn't “scour” at Gettysburg! How amazed he would be to discover that the ten immortal sentences he spoke there will probably be cherished as one of the literary glories and treasures of earth centuries hence, long after the Civil War is all but forgotten.

Lincoln's Gettysburg address is more than a speech. It is the divine expression of a rare soul exalted and made great by suffering. It is an unconscious prose poem, and has all the majestic beauty and profound roll of epic lines:

Four score and seven years ago

Our fathers brought forth upon this continent,

A new nation, conceived in Liberty,

And dedicated to the proposition

That all men are created equal.



Now we are engaged in a great civil war,

Testing whether that nation, or any nation

So conceived and so dedicated,

Can long endure. We are met

On a great battle-field of that war.

We have come to dedicate a portion of

That field as a final resting-place

For those who here gave their lives

That that nation might live.

It is altogether fitting and proper

That we should do this.



But, in a larger sense,

We can not dedicate—we can not consecrate

We can not hallow this ground. The brave men,

Living and dead, who struggled here

Have consecrated it far above our poor power

To add or detract. The world will little note,

Nor long remember what we say here,

But it can never forget what they did here.

It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here

To the unfinished work which they who fought here

Have thus far so nobly advanced.

It is rather for us to be here dedicated

To the great task remaining before us—

That from these honored dead we take

Increased devotion to that cause for which

They gave the last full measure of devotion—

That we here highly resolve that these dead

Shall not have died in vain—that this nation,

Under God, shall have a new birth of freedom—

And that government of the people,

By the people, for the people,

Shall not perish from the earth.





24


When the war began, in 1861, a shabby and disappointed man was sitting on a packing-case in a leather store in Galena, Illinois, smoking a clay pipe. His job, so far as he had one, was that of bookkeeper and buyer of hogs and hides from farmers.

His two younger brothers who owned the store didn't want him around at any price, but for months he had tramped the streets of St. Louis, looking in vain for some kind of position, until his wife and four children were destitute. Finally, in despair, he had borrowed a few dollars for a railway ticket and gone to see his father in Kentucky, begging for assistance. The old man had considerable cash, but, being loath to part with any of it, he sat down and wrote his two younger sons in Galena, instructing them to give their elder brother a job.

So they put him on the pay-roll at once, more as a matter of family politics and family charity than anything else.

Two dollars a day—that was his wage—and it was probably more than he was worth, for he had no more business ability than a jack-rabbit; he was lazy and slovenly, he loved cornwhisky, and he was eternally in debt. He was always borrowing small sums of money; so when his friends saw him coming, they used to look the other way and cross the street to avoid meeting him.

Everything he had undertaken in life, so far, had ended in failure and frustration.

So far.

But no more.

For good news and astounding good fortune were just around the corner.

In a little while he was to go flaring and flaming like a shooting star across the firmament of fame.

He couldn't command the respect of his home town now; but in three years he would command the most formidable army the world had ever seen.

In four years he would conquer Lee, end the war, and write his name in blazing letters of fire on the pages of history.

In eight years he would be in the White House.

After that he would make a triumphal tour of the world, with the high and mighty of all lands heaping honors, medals, flowers, and after-dinner oratory upon him—whom people back in Galena had crossed the street to avoid.

It is an astonishing tale.




Everything about it is strange. Even the attitude of his mother was abnormal. She never seemed to care much for him. She refused to visit him when he was President, and she didn't trouble even to name him when he was born. Her relatives attended to that, in a sort of lottery. When he was six weeks old, they wrote their favorite names on strips torn from a paper sack, mixed them in a hat, and drew one out. His grandmother Simpson had been reading Homer, and she wrote on her slip: “Hiram Ulysses.” It was drawn, and so, by chance, that was the name he bore at home for seventeen years.

But he was bashful and slow-witted, so the village wits called him “Useless” Grant.

At West Point he had still another name. The politician who made out the papers giving him an appointment to the Military Academy imagined that his middle name must be Simpson, his mother's maiden name, so he went as “U. S. Grant.” When the cadets learned this, they laughed and tossed their hats in the air, and shouted, “Boys, we've got Uncle Sam with us!” To the end of his life those who had been his classmates there called him Sam Grant.

He didn't mind. He made few friends, and he didn't care what people called him, and he didn't care how he looked. He wouldn't keep his coat buttoned or his gun clean or his shoes shined, and he was often late for roll-call. And, instead of mastering the military principles used by Napoleon and Frederick the Great, he spent much of his time at West Point poring over novels such as “Ivanhoe” and “The Last of the Mohicans.”

The incredible fact is that he never read a book on military strategy in his life.

After he had won the war the people of Boston raised money to buy him a library, appointing a committee to find out what books he already possessed. To its amazement, the committee learned that Grant didn't own a single military treatise of any description.

He disliked West Point and the army and everything connected with it; and, after he had become world-famous, he said to Bismarck while reviewing Germany's troops:

“I haven't much interest in military affairs. The truth is, I am more of a farmer than a soldier. Although I have been in two wars, I never entered the army without regret, and never left it without pleasure.”

Grant admitted that his besetting sin was laziness, and that he never liked to study. Even after he graduated from West Point he spelled knocked without the initial k and safety without an e; yet he was fairly good at figures, and hoped to be a professor of mathematics. But no position was available, so he spent eleven years with the regular army. He had to have something to eat, and that seemed the easiest way to get it.

In 1853 he was stationed at Fort Humboldt in California. In a near-by village there was a curious character named Ryan. Ryan ran a store, operated a sawmill, and did surveying during the week. On Sunday he preached. Whisky was cheap in those days, and Pastor Ryan kept an open barrel of it in the back of his store. A tin cup was hanging on the barrel, so you could go and help yourself whenever you had the urge. Grant had it often. He was lonely and wanted to forget the army life that he despised; as a result he got drunk so many times that he had virtually to be dismissed from the army.

He didn't have a dollar, and he didn't have a job; so he drifted back east to Missouri and spent the next four years plowing corn and slopping hogs on an eighty-acre farm belonging to his father-in-law. In the wintertime he cut cord-wood, hauled it to St. Louis, and sold it to the city people. But every year he got farther and farther behind, had to borrow more and more.

Finally he quit the farm, moved to St. Louis, and sought employment there. He tried to sell real estate, was a total failure at that, and then drifted about the town for weeks, looking for a job—any kind of job. At last he was in such desperate circumstances that he tried to hire out his wife's negroes, in order to get money to pay the grocer's bill.

Here is one of the most surprising facts about the Civil War: Lee believed that slavery was wrong, and had freed his own negroes long before the conflict came; but Grant's wife owned slaves at the very time that her husband was leading the armies of the North to destroy slavery.

When the war began, Grant was sick of his work in the Galena leather store and wanted to get back into the army.

That ought to have been easy for a West Point graduate, when the army had hundreds of thousands of raw recruits to whip into shape. But it wasn't. Galena raised a company of volunteers, and Grant drilled them because he was the only man in town who knew anything at all about drilling, but when they marched away to war with bouquets in their gun-barrels Grant stood on the sidewalk watching them. They had chosen another man as captain.

Then Grant wrote to the War Department, telling of his experience and asking to be appointed colonel of a regiment. His letter was never answered. It was found in the files of the War Department while he was President.

Finally he got a position in the adjutant's office in Springfield, doing clerical work that a fifteen-year-old girl could have done. He worked all day with his hat on, smoking constantly and copying orders on an old broken-down table with three legs, which had been shoved into a corner for support.

Then a wholly unexpected thing happened, an event that set his feet on the road to fame. The 21st Regiment of Illinois Volunteers had degenerated into an armed mob. They ignored orders, cursed their officers, and chased old Colonel Goode out of camp, vowing that if he showed up again they would nail his hide on a sour-apple tree.

Governor Yates was worried.

He didn't think much of Grant, but after all the man had been graduated from West Point, so the governor took a chance. And on a sunny June day in 1861 Grant walked out to the Springfield fair-grounds to take over the command of a regiment that no one else could rule.

A stick that he carried, and a red bandana tied around his waist—these were his only visible signs of authority.

He didn't have a horse or a uniform, or the money to buy either. There were holes in the top of his sweat-stained hat, and his elbows stuck out of his old coat.

His men began making fun of him at once. One chap started sparring at him behind his back, and another fellow rushed up behind the pugilist and shoved him so hard that he stumbled forward and hit Grant between the shoulders.

Grant stopped all their foolishness immediately. If a man disobeyed orders he was tied to a post and left there all day. If he cursed a gag was put into his mouth. If the regiment was late at roll-call—as they all were on one occasion—they got nothing to eat for twenty-four hours. The ex-hide-buyer from Galena tamed their tempestuous spirits and led them away to do battle down in Missouri.

Shortly after that another piece of amazing good fortune came his way. In those days the War Department was making brigadier-generals by the dozens. Northwestern Illinois had sent Elihu B. Washburne to Congress. Washburne, fired with political ambitions, was desperately eager to show the folks back home that he was on the job, so he went to the War Department and demanded that one brigadier-general come from his district. All right. But who? That was easy: there was only one West Point graduate among Washburne's constituents.

So a few days later Grant picked up a St. Louis newspaper, and read the surprising news that he was a brigadier-general.

He was assigned headquarters at Cairo, Illinois, and immediately began to do things. He loaded his soldiers on boats, steamed up the Ohio, occupied Paducah, a strategic point in Kentucky, and proposed marching down into Tennessee to attack Fort Donelson, which commanded the Cumberland River. Military experts like Halleck said: “Nonsense! You are talking foolishly, Grant. It can't be done. It would be suicide to attempt it.”

Grant went ahead and tried it, and captured the fort and fifteen thousand prisoners in one afternoon.

While Grant was attacking, the Confederate general sent him a note, begging for a truce, to arrange terms of capitulation, but Grant replied rather tartly:

“My only terms are unconditional and immediate surrender. I propose to move immediately upon your works.”

Simon Buckner, the Confederate general to whom this curt message was addressed, had known Sam Grant at West Point and had lent him money to pay his board bill when he was fired from the army. In view of that loan, Buckner felt that Grant ought to have been a trifle more gracious in his phraseology. But Buckner forgave him and surrendered and spent the afternoon smoking and reminiscing with Grant about old times.

The fall of Fort Donelson had far-reaching consequences: it saved Kentucky for the North, enabled the Union troops to advance two hundred miles without opposition, drove the Confederates out of a large part of Tennessee, cut off their supplies, caused the fall of Nashville and of Fort Columbus, the Gibraltar of the Mississippi, spread profound depression throughout the South, and set church bells ringing and bonfires blazing from Maine to the Mississippi.

It was a stupendous victory, and created a tremendous impression even in Europe. It was really one of the turning-points of the war.

From that time on, U. S. Grant was known as “Unconditional Surrender” Grant, and “I propose to move on your works immediately” became the battle-cry of the North.

Here, at last, was the great leader for which the country had been waiting. Congress made him a major-general; he was appointed commander of the Military Department of Western Tennessee, and quickly became the idol of the nation. One newspaper mentioned that he liked to smoke during a battle, and, presto! over ten thousand boxes of cigars were showered upon him.

But in less than three weeks after all this Grant was actually in tears of rage and mortification because of unfair treatment by a jealous superior officer.

His immediate superior in the West was Halleck, a colossal and unmitigated ass. Admiral Foote called Halleck “a military imbecile,” and Gideon Welles, Lincoln's Secretary of the Navy, who knew Halleck intimately, sums him up thus:

“Halleck originates nothing, anticipates nothing, suggests nothing, plans nothing, decides nothing, is good for nothing and does nothing except scold, smoke and scratch his elbows.”

But Halleck thought very well of himself. He had been an assistant professor at West Point, had written books on military strategy, international law, and mining, had been director of a silver-mine, president of a railway, a successful attorney, had mastered French and translated a tome on Napoleon. In his own opinion, he was the distinguished scholar, Henry Wager Halleck.

And who was Grant? A nobody, a drunken and discredited army captain. When Grant came to see him, before attacking Fort Donelson, Halleck was rude, and dismissed his military suggestions with irritation and contempt. Now Grant had won a great victory and had the nation at his feet, while Halleck was still scratching his elbows in St. Louis, unnoticed and ignored. And it galled Halleck.

To make matters worse, he felt that this erstwhile hide-buyer was insulting him. He telegraphed Grant day after day, and Grant brazenly ignored his orders. At least, so Halleck imagined. But he was wrong. Grant had sent report upon report; but, after the fall of Donelson, a break in telegraphic communications had made it impossible for his telegrams to get through. However, Halleck didn't know this, and he was indignant. Victory and public adulation had gone to Grant's head, had they? Well, he would teach this young upstart a lesson. So he wired McClellan repeatedly, denouncing Grant. Grant was this, Grant was that—insolent, drunk, idle, ignoring orders, incompetent. “I'm tired and worn out with this neglect and inefficiency.”

McClellan, too, was envious of Grant's popularity; so he sent Halleck what, in the light of history, is the most amazing telegram of the Civil War: “Do not hesitate to arrest him [Grant] at once if the good of the service requires it, and place C. F. Smith in command.”

Halleck immediately took Grant's army away from him, virtually placed him under arrest, and then leaned back in his chair and scratched his elbows with savage satisfaction.




The war was almost a year old now, and the only general who had won a considerable victory for the North stood stripped of all power and in public disgrace.

Later Grant was restored to command. Then he blundered woefully at the Battle of Shiloh; if Johnston, the Confederate general, had not bled to death during the fighting, Grant's entire army might have been surrounded and captured. Shiloh was, at that time, the greatest battle that had ever been fought on this continent, and Grant's losses were staggering—thirteen thousand men. He had acted stupidly; he had been taken by surprise. He deserved criticism, and it came roaring down upon him. He was falsely accused of being intoxicated at Shiloh, and millions believed it. A tidal wave of popular indignation swept over the country, and the public clamored for his removal. But Lincoln said:

“I can't spare this man. He fights.”

When people told him Grant drank too much whisky, he inquired: “What brand? I want to send a few barrels to some of my other generals.”

The following January Grant assumed command of the expedition against Vicksburg. The campaign against this natural fortress, perched on a high bluff two hundred feet above the Mississippi, was long and heartbreaking. The place was heavily fortified, and the gunboats on the river couldn't elevate their cannon high enough to touch it. Grant's problem was to get his army close enough to attack it.

He went back to the heart of Mississippi and tried to march on it from the east. That failed.

Then he cut away the levees of the river, put his army on boats, and tried to float through the swamps and get at the place from the north. That failed.

Then he dug a canal and tried to change the course of the Mississippi. That failed.

It was a trying winter. Rain fell almost continuously, the river flooded the whole valley, and Grant's troops floundered through miles of swamps, ooze, bayous, tangled forests, and trailing vines. Men stood up to their waists in mud, they ate in the mud, they slept in the mud. Malarial fever broke out, and measles and smallpox. Sanitation was well-nigh impossible, and the death-rate was appalling.

The Vicksburg campaign was a failure—that was the cry that went up everywhere. A stupid failure, a tragic failure, a criminal failure.

Grant's own generals—Sherman, McPherson, Logan, Wilson —regarded his plans as absurd, and believed they would end in black ruin. The press throughout the country was vitriolic, and the nation was demanding Grant's removal.

“He has hardly a friend left except myself,” Lincoln said.

Despite all opposition, Lincoln clung to Grant; and he had his faith richly rewarded, for, on July 4, the same day that the timid Meade let Lee escape at Gettysburg, Grant rode into Vicksburg on a horse taken from the plantation of Jefferson Davis, and won a greater victory than any American general had achieved since the days of Washington.

After eight months of desolating failure, Grant had captured forty thousand prisoners at Vicksburg, placed the entire Mississippi River in the hands of the North, and split the Confederacy.

The news set the nation aflame with enthusiasm.

Congress passed a special act in order that Grant could be made lieutenant-general—an honor that no man had worn since the death of Washington—and Lincoln, calling him to the White House, made a short address appointing him commander of all the armies of the Union.

Forewarned that he would have to reply with a speech of acceptance, Grant drew out of his pocket a little wrinkled piece of paper containing only three sentences. As he began to read, the paper shook, his face flushed, his knees trembled, and his voice failed. Breaking down completely, he clutched the shaking paper with both hands, shifted his position, took a deep breath, and began all over again.

The hog-and-hide buyer from Galena found it easier to face bullets than to deliver a speech of eighty-four words before an audience of eleven men.

Mrs. Lincoln, eager to make a social event out of Grant's presence in Washington, had already arranged a dinner and a party in the general's honor. But Grant begged to be excused, saying he must hasten back to the front.

“But we can't excuse you,” the President insisted. “Mrs. Lincoln's dinner without you would be ‘Hamlet’ without Hamlet.”

“A dinner to me,” replied Grant, “means a million dollars a day loss to the country. Besides, I've had about enough of this show business, anyway.”

Lincoln loved a man who would talk like that—one who, like himself, despised “fizzlegigs and fireworks,” and one who would “take responsibility and act.”

Lincoln's hopes rose and towered now. He was sure that, with Grant in command, all would soon be well.

But he was wrong. Within four months the country was plunged into blacker gloom and deeper despair than ever, and once more Lincoln was pacing the floor throughout the night, haggard and worn and desperate.

In May 1864, the triumphant Grant plunged across the Rapidan River with 122,000 men. He was going to destroy's Lee's army forthwith and end the war at once.

Lee met him in the “wilderness” of North Virginia. The place was well named. It was a jungle of rolling hills and swampy swales smothered with a dense second growth of pine and oaks and matted with underbrush so thick that a cottontail could hardly crawl through it. And in those gloomy and tangled woods, Grant fought a grim and bloody campaign. The slaughter was appalling. The jungle itself caught on fire and hundreds of the wounded were consumed by the flames.

At the end of the second day even the stolid Grant was so shaken that he retired to his tent and wept.

But after every battle, no matter what the results, he gave the same order: “Advance! Advance!”

At the end of the sixth bloody day he sent the famous telegram: “I propose to fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.”

Well, it did take all summer. Moreover, it took all autumn, and all winter, and a part of the next spring.

Grant had twice as many men in the field now as the enemy had, and back of him, in the North, lay a vast reservoir of manpower upon which he could draw, while the South had almost exhausted its recruits and supplies.

“The rebels,” said Grant, “have already robbed the cradle and the grave.”

Grant held that the quick way and the only way to end the war was to keep on killing Lee's men until Lee surrendered.

What if two Northern soldiers were shot for every one the South lost? Grant could make up the wastage, but Lee couldn't. So Grant kept on blasting and snooting and slaying.

In six weeks he lost 54,926 men—as many as Lee had in his entire army.

In one hour at Cold Harbor he lost seven thousand—a thousand more than had been killed on both sides in three days during the Battle of Gettysburg.

And what advantage was achieved by this ghastly loss?

We shall let Grant himself answer the question: “None whatever.” That was his estimate.

The attack at Cold Harbor was the most tragic blunder of his career.

Such slaughter was more than human nerves and human bodies could endure. It broke the morale of the troops; the rank and file of the army were on the verge of mutiny, and the officers themselves were ready to rebel.

“For thirty-six days now,” said one of Grant's corps commanders, “there has been one unbroken funeral procession past me.”

Lincoln, broken-hearted though he was, realized that there was nothing to do but keep on. He telegraphed Grant to “hold on with a bull dog grip and chew and choke.” Then he issued a call for half a million more men, to serve from one to three years.

The call staggered the country. The nation was plunged into an abyss of despair.

“Everything now is darkness and doubt and discouragement,” one of Lincoln's secretaries recorded in his diary.

On July 2 Congress adopted a resolution that sounded like the lamentations of one of the Hebrew prophets of the Old Testament. It requested the citizens to “confess and repent of their manifold sins, implore the compassion and forgiveness of the Almighty, and beseech him as the Supreme Ruler of the world not to destroy us as a people.”

Lincoln was being cursed now almost as violently in the North as in the South. He was denounced as a usurper, a traitor, a tyrant, a fiend, a monster, “a bloody butcher shouting war to the knife and knife to the hilt, and crying for more victims for his slaughter pens.”

Some of his most bitter enemies declared that he ought to be killed. And one evening as he was riding out to his summer headquarters at the Soldiers' Home, a would-be assassin fired at him and put a bullet through his tall silk hat.

A few weeks later the proprietor of a hotel in Meadville, Pennsylvania, found this inscription scratched on a windowpane: “Abe Lincoln Departed this Life August 13, 1864, by the effect of poison.” The room had been occupied the night before by a popular actor named Booth—John Wilkes Booth.

The preceding June the Republicans had nominated Lincoln for a second term. But they felt now that they had made a mistake, a woeful mistake. Some of the most prominent men in the party urged Lincoln to withdraw. Others demanded it. They wanted to call another convention, admit that Lincoln was a failure, cancel his nomination, and place another candidate at the head of the ticket.

Even Lincoln's close friend Orville Browning recorded in his diary in July, 1864, that the “nation's great need is a competent leader at the head of affairs.”

Lincoln himself now believed that his case was hopeless. He abandoned all thought of being elected for a second term. He had failed. His generals had failed. His war policy had failed. The people had lost faith in his leadership, and he feared that the Union itself would be destroyed.

“Even the heavens,” he exclaimed, “are hung in black.”

Finally a large group of radicals, disgusted with Lincoln, called another convention, nominated the picturesque General John C. Fremont as their candidate, and split the Republican party.

The situation was grave; and there is hardly a doubt that if Frémont hadn't withdrawn from the race later, General McClellan, the Democratic candidate, would have triumphed over his divided opponents and the history of the nation would have been changed.

Even with Fremont out of the race, Lincoln received only 200,000 more votes than McClellan.

Notwithstanding the vitriolic condemnation poured upon him, Lincoln went calmly on, doing his best and answering no one.

“I desire,” he said, “to so conduct the affairs of this administration that if, at the end, when I come to lay down the reins of power, I have lost every other friend on earth, I shall at least have one friend left, and that friend shall be deep down inside of me.... I am not bound to win, but I am bound to be true. I am not bound to succeed, but I am bound to live up to the light I have.”

Weary and despondent, he often stretched himself out on a sofa, picked up a small Bible, and turned to Job for comfort: “Gird up now thy loins like a man; for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me.”




In the summer of 1864, Lincoln was a changed man, changed in mind and body from the physical giant who had come off the prairies of Illinois three years before. Year by year his laughter had grown less frequent; the furrows in his face had deepened; his shoulders had stooped; his cheeks were sunken; he suffered from chronic indigestion; his legs were always cold; he could hardly sleep; he wore habitually an expression of anguish. He said to a friend: “I feel as though I shall never be glad again.”

When Augustus Saint-Gaudens saw a life-mask of Lincoln that had been made in the spring of 1865, the famous sculptor thought that it was a death-mask, insisted that it must be, for already the marks of death were upon his face.

Carpenter, the artist who lived at the White House for months while he was painting the scene of the Emancipation Proclamation, wrote:

During the first week of the battle of the Wilderness, the President scarcely slept at all. Passing through the main hall of the domestic apartment on one of those days, I met him, clad in a long morning wrapper, pacing back and forth, his hands behind him, great black rings under his eyes, his head bent forward upon his breast—the picture of sorrow and care and anxiety.... There were whole days when I could scarcely look into his furrowed face without weeping.

Callers found him collapsed in his chair, so exhausted that he did not look up or speak when they first addressed him.

“I sometimes fancy,” he declared, “that every one of the throng that comes to see me daily darts at me with thumb and finger and picks out his piece of my vitality and carries it away.”

He told Mrs. Stowe, the author of “Uncle Tom's Cabin,” that he would never live to see peace.

“This war is killing me,” he said.

His friends, alarmed at the change in his appearance, urged him to take a vacation.

“Two or three weeks would do me no good,” he replied. “I cannot fly from my thoughts. I hardly know how to rest. What is tired lies within me and can't be got at.”

“The cry of the widow and the orphan,” said his secretary, “was always in Lincoln's ear.”

Mothers and sweethearts and wives, weeping and pleading, rushed to him daily to obtain pardons for men who had been condemned to be shot. No matter how worn he was, how exhausted, Lincoln always heard their stories, and generally granted their requests, for he never could bear to see a woman cry, especially if she had a baby in her arms.

“When I am gone,” he moaned, “I hope it can be said of me that I plucked a thistle and planted a flower wherever I thought a flower would grow.”

The generals scolded and Stanton stormed: Lincoln's leniency was destroying the discipline of the army, he must keep his hands off. But the truth is he hated the brutal methods of brigadier-generals, and the despotism of the regular army. On the other hand, he loved the volunteers on whom he had to depend for winning the war—men who, like himself, had come from the forest and farm.

Was one of them condemned to be shot for cowardice? Lincoln would pardon him, saying, “I have never been sure but what I might drop my gun and run, myself, if I were in battle.”

Had a volunteer become homesick and run away? “Well, I don't see that shooting will do him any good.”

Had a tired and exhausted Vermont farm boy been sentenced to death for falling asleep on sentinel duty? “I might have done the same thing, myself,” Lincoln would say.

A mere list of his pardons would fill many pages.

He once wired to General Meade, “I am unwilling for any boy under eighteen to be shot.” And there were more than a million boys under that age in the Union armies. In fact, there were a fifth of a million under sixteen, and a hundred thousand under fifteen.

Sometimes the President worked a bit of humor into his most serious messages; as, for example, when he wired Colonel Mulligan, “If you haven't shot Barney D. yet, don't.”

The anguish of bereaved mothers touched Lincoln very deeply. On November 21, 1864, he wrote the most beautiful and famous letter of his life. Oxford University has a copy of this letter hanging on its wall, “as a model of pure and exquisite diction which has never been excelled.”

Although written as prose, it is really unconscious and resonant poetry:

Executive Mansion,

Washington, Nov. 21, 1864.

To Mrs. Bixby, Boston, Mass.

Dear Madame,

I have been shown in the files of the War Department

A statement of the Adjutant General of Massachusetts

That you are the mother of five sons

Who have died gloriously on the field of battle. I feel

How weak and fruitless must be any words of mine

Which would attempt to beguile you from the grief

Of a loss so overwhelming. But I cannot refrain

From tendering to you the consolation that may be found

In the thanks of the Republic they died to save.

I pray that our Heavenly Father may assuage

The anguish of your bereavement, and leave you only

The cherished memory of the loved and lost,

And the solemn pride that must be yours to have laid

So costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.

Yours very sincerely and respectfully,

A. Lincoln.

One day Noah Brooks gave Lincoln a volume of Oliver Wendell Holmes's verses. Opening the book, Lincoln began reading the poem “Lexington” aloud, but when he came to the stanza beginning:

Green be the grass where her martyrs are lying!

Shroudless and tombless they sunk to their rest,

his voice quavered, he choked, and handing the volume back to Brooks, he whispered: “You read it. I can't.”

Months afterward he recited the entire poem to friends in the White House, without missing a word.

On April 5, 1864, Lincoln received a letter from a brokenhearted girl in Washington County, Pennsylvania.

“After long hesitation through dread and fear,” she began, “I have at last concluded to inform you of my troubles.” The man to whom she had been engaged for some years had joined the army, had later been permitted to go home to vote, and they had, as she put it, “very foolishly indulged too freely in matrimonial affairs.” And now “the results of our indulgences are going to bring upon us both an unlawful family providing you do not take mercy upon us and grant him a leave of absence in order to ratify past events.... I hope and pray to God that you will not cast me aside in scorn and dismay.”

Reading the letter, Lincoln was deeply touched. He stared out the window with unseeing eyes in which there were doubtlessly tears....

Picking up his pen, Lincoln wrote the following words to Stanton across the bottom of the girl's letter: “Send him to her by all means.”




The terrible summer of 1864 dragged to an end, and the autumn brought good news: Sherman had taken Atlanta and was marching through Georgia. Admiral Farragut, after a dramatic naval battle, had captured Mobile Bay and tightened the blockade in the Gulf of Mexico. Sheridan had won brilliant and spectacular victories in the Shenandoah Valley. And Lee was now afraid to come out in the open; so Grant was laying siege to Petersburg and Richmond....

The Confederacy had almost reached the end.

Lincoln's generals were winning now, his policy had been vindicated, and the spirits of the North rose as on wings; so, in November, he was elected for a second term. But instead of taking it as a personal triumph, he remarked laconically that evidently the people had not thought it wise “to swap horses while crossing a stream.”

After four years of fighting, there was no hatred in Lincoln's heart for the people of the South. Time and again he said: “‘Judge not that ye be not judged.’ They are just what we would be in their position.”

So in February, 1865, while the Confederacy was already crumbling to dust, and Lee's surrender was only two months away, Lincoln proposed that the Federal Government pay the Southern States four hundred million dollars for their slaves; but every member of his Cabinet was unfriendly to the idea and he dropped it.

The following month, on the occasion of his second inauguration, Lincoln delivered a speech that the late Earl Curzon, Chancellor of Oxford University, declared to be “the purest gold of human eloquence, nay of eloquence almost divine.”

Stepping forward and kissing a Bible open at the fifth chapter of Isaiah, he began an address that sounded like the speech of some great character in drama.

“It was like a sacred poem,” wrote Carl Schurz. “No ruler had ever spoken words like these to his people. America had never before had a president who had found such words in the depths of his heart.”

The closing words of this speech are, in the estimation of the writer, the most noble and beautiful utterances ever delivered by the lips of mortal man. He never reads them without thinking somehow of an organ playing in the subdued light of a great cathedral.

Fondly do we hope—fervently do we pray—that this mighty scourge of war may speedily pass away. Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said, “The judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.”

With malice toward none; with charity for all; with firmness in the right, as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to finish the work we are in; to bind up the nation's wounds; to care for him who shall have borne the battle, and for his widow, and his orphan—to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves, and with all nations.

Two months later, to a day, this speech was read at Lincoln's funeral services in Springfield.

In the latter part of March, 1865, something very significant happened in Richmond, Virginia. Mrs. Jefferson Davis, wife of the President of the Confederacy, disposed of her carriage horses, placed her personal effects on sale at a dry-goods store, packed up the remainder of her belongings, and headed farther south.... Something was about to happen.

Grant had been besieging the Confederate capital now for nine months. Lee's troops were ragged and hungry. Money was scarce, and they were rarely paid; and when they were, it was with the paper script of the Confederacy, which was almost worthless now. It took three dollars of it to buy a cup of coffee, five dollars to buy a stick of firewood, and a thousand dollars was demanded for a barrel of flour.

Secession was a lost cause. And so was slavery. Lee knew it. And his men knew it. A hundred thousand of them had already deserted. Whole regiments were packing up now and walking out together. Those that remained were turning to religion for solace and hope. Prayer-meetings were being held in almost every tent; men were shouting and weeping and seeing visions, and entire regiments were kneeling before going into battle.

But notwithstanding all this piety, Richmond was tottering to its fall.

On Sunday, April 2, Lee's army set fire to the cotton and tobacco warehouses in the town, burned the arsenal, destroyed the half-finished ships at the wharves, and fled from the city at night while towering flames were roaring up into the darkness.

They were no sooner out of town than Grant was in hot pursuit with seventy-two thousand men, banging away at the Confederates from both sides and the rear, while Sheridan's cavalry was heading them off in front, tearing up railway lines, and capturing supply-trains.

Sheridan telegraphed to headquarters, “I think if this thing is pushed, Lee will surrender.”

Lincoln wired back, “Let the thing be pushed.”

It was; and, after a running fight of eighty miles, Grant finally hemmed the Southern troops in on all sides. They were trapped, and Lee realized that further bloodshed would be futile.

In the meantime Grant, half blind with a violent sick headache, had fallen behind his army and halted at a farmhouse on Saturday evening.

“I spent the night,” he records in his Memoirs, “in bathing my feet in hot water and mustard, and putting mustard plasters on my wrists and the back part of my neck, hoping to be cured by morning.”

The next morning, he was cured instantaneously. And the thing that did it was not a mustard plaster, but a horseman galloping down the road with a letter from Lee, saying he wanted to surrender.

“When the officer [bearing the message] reached me,” Grant wrote, “I was still suffering with the sick-headache, but the instant I saw the contents of the note, I was cured.”

The two generals met that afternoon in a small bare parlor of a brick dwelling to arrange terms. Grant as usual was slouchily dressed: his shoes were grimy, he had no sword, and he wore the same uniform that every private in the army wore—except that his had three silver stars on the shoulder to show who he was.

What a contrast he made to the aristocratic Lee, wearing beaded gauntlets and a sword studded with jewels! Lee looked like some royal conqueror who had just stepped out of a steel engraving, while Grant looked more like a Missouri farmer who had come to town to sell a load of hogs and a few hides. For once Grant felt ashamed of his frowzy appearance, and he apologized to Lee for not being better dressed for the occasion.

Twenty years before, Grant and Lee had both been officers in the regular army while the United States was waging a war against Mexico. So they fell to reminiscing now about the days of long ago, about the winter the “regulars” spent on the border of Mexico, about the poker games that used to last all night, about their amateur production of “Othello” when Grant played the sweetly feminine role of Desdemona.

“Our conversation grew so pleasant,” Grant records, “that I almost forgot the object of our meeting.”

Finally, Lee brought the conversation around to the terms of surrender; but Grant replied to that very briefly, and then his mind went rambling on again, back across two decades, to Corpus Christi and the winter in 1845 when the wolves howled on the prairies... and the sunlight danced on the waves... and wild horses could be bought for three dollars apiece.

Grant might have gone on like that all afternoon if Lee had not interrupted and reminded him, for the second time, that he had come there to surrender his army.

So Grant asked for pen and ink, and scrawled out the terms. There were to be no humiliating ceremonies of capitulation such as Washington had exacted from the British at Yorktown in 1781, with the helpless enemy parading without guns, between long lines of their exultant conquerors. And there was to be no vengeance. For four bloody years the radicals of the North had been demanding that Lee and the other West Point officers who had turned traitor to their flag be hanged for treason. But the terms that Grant wrote out had no sting. Lee's officers were permitted to keep their arms, and his men were to be paroled and sent home; and every soldier who claimed a horse or a mule could crawl on it and ride it back to his farm or cotton-patch and start tilling the soil once more.

Why were the terms of surrender so generous and gentle? Because Abraham Lincoln himself had dictated the terms.

And so the war that had killed half a million men came to a close in a tiny Virginia village called Appomattox Court House. The surrender took place on a peaceful spring afternoon when the scent of lilacs filled the air. It was Palm Sunday.

On that very afternoon Lincoln was sailing back to Washington on the good ship River Queen. He spent several hours reading Shakspere aloud to his friends. Presently he came to this passage in “Macbeth:”

Duncan is in his grave;

After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;

Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,

Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,

Can touch him further.

These lines made a profound impression on Lincoln. He read them once, then paused, gazing with unseeing eyes through the port-hole of the ship.

Presently he read them aloud again.

Five days later Lincoln himself was dead.





27


We must retrace our steps now, for I want to tell you of an amazing thing that happened shortly before the fall of Richmond—an incident that gives one a vivid picture of the domestic miseries that Lincoln endured in silence for almost a quarter of a century.

It happened near Grant's headquarters. The general had invited Mr. and Mrs. Lincoln to spend a week with him near the front.

They were glad to come, for the President was almost exhausted. He hadn't had a vacation since he entered the White House, and he was eager to get away from the throng of office-seekers who were harassing him once more at the opening of his second term.

So he and Mrs. Lincoln boarded the River Queen and sailed away down the Potomac, through the lower reaches of Chesapeake Bay, past old Point Comfort, and up the James River to City Point. There, high on a bluff, two hundred feet above the water, sat the ex-hide-buyer from Galena, smoking and whittling.

A few days later the President's party was joined by a distinguished group of people from Washington, including M. Geoffroi, the French minister. Naturally the visitors were eager to see the battle lines of the Army of the Potomac, twelve miles away; so the next day they set out upon the excursion—the men on horseback, Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Grant following in a half-open carriage.

General Adam Badeau, Grant's military secretary and aidede-camp and one of the closest friends General Grant ever had, was detailed to escort the ladies that day. He sat on the front seat of the carriage, facing them and with his back to the horses. He was an eye-witness to all that occurred, and I am quoting now from pages 356—362 of his book entitled “Grant in Peace:”

In the course of conversation, I chanced to mention that all the wives of officers at the army front had been ordered to the rear—a sure sign that active operations were in contemplation. I said not a lady had been allowed to remain, except Mrs. Griffin, the wife of General Charles Griffin, who had obtained a special permit from the President.

At this Mrs. Lincoln was up in arms. “What do you mean by that, sir?” she exclaimed. “Do you mean to say that she saw the President alone? Do you know that I never allow the President to see any woman alone?”

She was absolutely jealous of poor, ugly Abraham Lincoln.

I tried to pacify her and to palliate my remark, but she was fairly boiling over with rage. “That's a very equivocal smile, sir,” she exclaimed: “Let me out of this carriage at once. I will ask the President if he saw that woman alone.”

Mrs. Griffin, afterward the Countess Esterhazy, was one of the best known and most elegant women in Washington, a Carroll, and a personal acquaintance of Mrs. Grant, who strove to mollify the excited spouse, but all in vain. Mrs. Lincoln again bade me stop the driver, and when I hesitated to obey, she thrust her arms past me to the front of the carriage and held the driver fast. But Mrs. Grant finally prevailed upon her to wait till the whole party alighted....

At night, when we were back in camp, Mrs. Grant talked over the matter with me, and said the whole affair was so distressing and mortifying that neither of us must ever mention it; at least, I was to be absolutely silent, and she would disclose it only to the General. But the next day I was released from my pledge, for “worse remained behind.”

The same party went in the morning to visit the Army of the James on the north side of the river, commanded by General Ord. The arrangements were somewhat similar to those of the day before. We went up the river in a steamer, and then the men again took horses and Mrs. Lincoln and Mrs. Grant proceeded in an ambulance. I was detailed as before to act as escort, but I asked for a companion in the duty; for after my experience, I did not wish to be the only officer in the carriage. So Colonel Horace Porter was ordered to join the party. Mrs. Ord accompanied her husband; as she was the wife of the commander of an army she was not subject to the order for return; though before that day was over she wished herself in Washington or anywhere else away from the army, I am sure. She was mounted, and as the ambulance was full, she remained on her horse and rode for a while by the side of the President, and thus preceded Mrs. Lincoln.

As soon as Mrs. Lincoln discovered this her rage was beyond all bounds. “What does the woman mean,” she exclaimed, “by riding by the side of the President? and ahead of me? Does she suppose that he wants her by the side of him?”

She was in a frenzy of excitement, and language and action both became more extravagant every moment.

Mrs. Grant again endeavored to pacify her, but then Mrs. Lincoln got angry with Mrs. Grant; and all that Porter and I could do was to see that nothing worse than words occurred. We feared she might jump out of the vehicle and shout to the cavalcade.

Once she said to Mrs. Grant in her transports: “I suppose you think you'll get to the White House yourself, don't you?” Mrs. Grant was very calm and dignified, and merely replied that she was quite satisfied with her present position; it was far greater than she had ever expected to attain. But Mrs. Lincoln exclaimed; “Oh! you had better take it if you can get it. Tis very nice.” Then she reverted to Mrs. Ord, while Mrs. Grant defended her friend at the risk of arousing greater vehemence.

When there was a halt, Major Seward, a nephew of the Secretary of State, and an officer of General Ord's staff, rode up, and tried to say something jocular. “The President's horse is very gallant, Mrs. Lincoln,” he remarked; “he insists on riding by the side of Mrs. Ord.”

This of course added fuel to the flame.

“What do you mean by that, sir?” she cried.

Seward discovered that he had made a huge mistake, and his horse at once developed a peculiarity that compelled him to ride behind, to get out of the way of the storm.

Finally the party arrived at its destination and Mrs. Ord came up to the ambulance. Then Mrs. Lincoln positively insulted her, called her vile names in the presence of a crowd of officers, and asked what she meant by following up the President. The poor woman burst into tears and inquired what she had done, but Mrs. Lincoln refused to be appeased, and stormed till she was tired. Mrs. Grant still tried to stand by her friend, and everybody was shocked and horrified. But all things come to an end, and after a while we returned to City Point.

That night the President and Mrs. Lincoln entertained General and Mrs. Grant and the General's staff at dinner on the steamer, and before us all Mrs. Lincoln berated General Ord to the President, and urged that he should be removed. He was unfit for his place, she said, to say nothing of his wife. General Grant sat next and defended his officer bravely. Of course General Ord was not removed.

During all this visit similar scenes were occurring. Mrs. Lincoln repeatedly attacked her husband in the presence of officers because of Mrs. Griffin and Mrs. Ord, and I never suffered greater humiliation and pain on account of one not a near personal friend than when I saw the Head of the State, the man who carried all the cares of the nation at such a crisis—subjected to this inexpressible public mortification. He bore it as Christ might have done; with an expression of pain and sadness that cut one to the heart, but with supreme calmness and dignity. He called her “mother,” with his old-time plainness; he pleaded with eyes and tones, and endeavored to explain or palliate the offenses of others, till she turned on him like a tigress; and then he walked away, hiding that noble, ugly face that we might not catch the full expression of its misery.

General Sherman was a witness of some of these episodes and mentioned them in his memoirs many years ago.

Captain Barnes, of the navy, was a witness and a sufferer too. Barnes had accompanied Mrs. Ord on her unfortunate ride and refused afterward to say that the lady was to blame. Mrs. Lincoln never forgave him. A day or two afterward he went to speak to the President on some official matter when Mrs. Lincoln and several others were present. The President's wife said something to him unusually offensive that all the company could hear. Lincoln was silent, but after a moment he went up to the young officer, and taking him by the arm led him into his own cabin, to show him a map or a paper, he said. He made no remark, Barnes told me, upon what had occurred. He could not rebuke his wife; but he showed his regret, and his regard for the officer, with a touch of what seemed to me the most exquisite breeding imaginable.

Shortly before these occurrences Mrs. Stanton had visited City Point, and I chanced to ask her some question about the President's wife.

“I do not visit Mrs. Lincoln,” was the reply.

But I thought I must have been mistaken; the wife of the Secretary of War must visit the wife of the President; and I renewed my inquiry.

“Understand me, sir?” she repeated; “I do not go to the White House; I do not visit Mrs. Lincoln.” I was not at all intimate with Mrs. Stanton and this remark was so extraordinary that I never forgot it; but I understood it afterward.

Mrs. Lincoln continued her conduct toward Mrs. Grant, who strove to placate her and then Mrs. Lincoln became more outrageous still. She once rebuked Mrs. Grant for sitting in her presence. “How dare you be seated,” she said, “until I invite you?”

Elizabeth Keckley, who accompanied Mrs. Lincoln on this trip to Grant's headquarters, tells of a dinner party that “Mrs. President” gave aboard the River Queen.

One of the guests was a young officer attached to the Sanitary Commission. He was seated near Mrs. Lincoln, and, by way of pleasantry, remarked: “Mrs. Lincoln, you should have seen the President the other day, on his triumphal entry into Richmond. He was the cynosure of all eyes. The ladies kissed their hands to him, and greeted him with the waving of handkerchiefs. He is quite a hero when surrounded by pretty young ladies.”

The young officer suddenly paused with a look of embarrass-ment.

Mrs. Lincoln turned to him with flashing eyes, with the remark that his familiarity was offensive to her.

Quite a scene followed, and I do not think that the Captain who incurred Mrs. Lincoln's displeasure will ever forget that memorable evening.

“I never in my life saw a more peculiarly constituted woman,” says Mrs. Keckley. “Search the world over and you will not find her counterpart.”

“Ask the first American you meet, ‘What kind of a woman was Lincoln's wife?’” says Honoré Willsie Morrow in her book “Mary Todd Lincoln,” “and the chances are ninety nine to one hundred that he'll reply that she was a shrew, a curse to her husband, a vulgar fool, insane.”

The great tragedy of Lincoln's life was not his assassination, but his marriage.

When Booth fired, Lincoln did not know what had hit him, but for twenty-three years he had reaped almost daily what Herndon described as “the bitter harvest of conjugal infelicity.”

“Amid storms of party hate and rebellious strife,” says General Badeau, “amid agonies... like those of the Cross... the hyssop of domestic misery was pressed to Lincoln's lips, and he too said: ‘Father, forgive: they know not what they do.’”




One of Lincoln's warmest friends during his life as President was Orville H. Browning, Senator from Illinois. These two men had known each other for a quarter of a century, and Browning was frequently a dinner guest in the White House and sometimes spent the night there. He kept a detailed diary, but one can only wonder what he recorded in it about Mrs. Lincoln, for authors have not been permitted to read the manuscript without pledging their honor not to divulge anything derogatory to her character. This manuscript was recently sold for publication with the provision that all shocking statements regarding Mrs. Lincoln should be deleted before it was put into print.

At public receptions in the White House it had always been customary for the President to choose some lady other than his wife to lead the promenade with him.

But custom or no custom, tradition or no tradition, Mrs. Lincoln wouldn't tolerate it. What? Another woman ahead of her? And on the President's arm? Never!

So she had her way, and Washington society hooted.

She not only refused to let the President walk with another woman, but she eyed him jealously and criticized him severely for even talking to one.

Before going to a public reception Lincoln would come to his jealous wife, asking whom he might talk to. She would mention woman after woman, saying she detested this one and hated that one.

“But Mother,” he would remonstrate, “I must talk with somebody. I can't stand around like a simpleton and say nothing. If you will not tell me who I may talk with, please tell me who I may not talk with.”

She determined to have her own way, cost what it might, and, on one occasion, she threatened to throw herself down in the mud in front of every one unless Lincoln promoted a certain officer.

At another time she dashed into his office during an important interview, pouring out a torrent of words. Without replying to her, Lincoln calmly arose, picked her up, carried her out of the room, set her down, returned, locked the door, and went on with his business as if he had never been interrupted.

She consulted a spiritualist, who told her that all of Lincoln's Cabinet were his enemies.

That didn't surprise her. She had no love for any of them.

She despised Seward, calling him “a hypocrite,” “an abolition sneak,” saying that he couldn't be trusted, and warning Lincoln to have nothing to do with him.

“Her hostility to Chase,” says Mrs. Keckley, “was bitter.”

And one of the reasons was this: Chase had a daughter, Kate, who was married to a wealthy man and was one of the most beautiful and charming women in Washington society. Kate would attend the White House receptions; and, to Mrs. Lincoln's immense disgust, she would draw all the men about her and run away with the show.

Mrs. Keckley says that “Mrs. Lincoln, who was jealous of the popularity of others, had no desire to build up the social position of Chase's daughter through political favor to her father.”

With heat and temper, she repeatedly urged Lincoln to dismiss Chase from the Cabinet.

She loathed Stanton, and when he criticized her, she “would return the compliment by sending him books and clippings describing him as an irascible and disagreeable personality.”

To all these bitter condemnations, Lincoln would say:

“Mother, you are mistaken; your prejudices are so violent you do not stop to reason. If I listened to you, I should soon be without a cabinet.”

She disliked Andrew Johnson intensely; she hated McClellan; she despised Grant, calling him “an obstinate fool and a butcher,” declaring that she could handle an army better than he could, and frequently vowing that if he were ever made President, she would leave the country and never come back to it as long as he was in the White House.

“Well, Mother,” Lincoln would say, “supposing that we give you command of the army. No doubt you would do much better than any general that has been tried.”

After Lee surrendered, Mr. and Mrs. Grant came to Washington. The town was a blaze of light: crowds were making merry with songs and bonfires and revelry; so Mrs. Lincoln wrote the general, inviting him to drive about the streets with her and the President “to see the illumination.”

But she did not invite Mrs. Grant.

A few nights later, however, she arranged a theater party and invited Mr. and Mrs. Grant and Mr. and Mrs. Stanton to sit in the President's box.

As soon as Mrs. Stanton received the invitation, she hurried over to Mrs. Grant, to inquire if she were going.

“Unless you accept the invitation,” said Mrs. Stanton, “I shall refuse. I will not sit in the box with Mrs. Lincoln unless you are there too.”

Mrs. Grant was afraid to accept.

She knew that if the general entered the box, the audience would be sure to greet the “hero of Appomattox” with a salvo of applause.

And then what would Mrs. Lincoln do? There was no telling. She might create another disgraceful and mortifying scene.

Mrs. Grant refused the invitation, and so did Mrs. Stanton; and by refusing, they may have saved the lives of their husbands, for that night Booth crept into the President's box and shot Lincoln; and if Stanton and Grant had been there, he might have tried to kill them also.

In 1863 a group of Virginia slave barons formed and financed a secret society the object of which was the assassination of Abraham Lincoln; and in December, 1864, an advertisement appeared in a newspaper published in Selma, Alabama, begging for public subscriptions for a fund to be used for the same purpose, while other Southern journals offered cash rewards for his death.

But the man who finally shot Lincoln was actuated neither by patriotic desires nor commercial motives. John Wilkes Booth did it to win fame.

What manner of man was Booth? He was an actor, and nature had endowed him with an extraordinary amount of charm and personal magnetism. Lincoln's own secretaries described him as “handsome as Endymion on Latmos, the pet of his little world.” Francis Wilson, in his biography of Booth, declares that “he was one of the world's successful lovers.... Women halted in the streets and instinctively turned to admire him as he passed.”

By the time he was twenty-three, Booth had achieved the status of a matinee idol; and, naturally, his most famous role was Romeo. Wherever he played, amorous maidens deluged him with saccharine notes. While he was playing in Boston huge crowds of women thronged the streets in front of the Tremont House, eager to catch but one glimpse of their hero as he passed. One night a jealous actress, Henrietta Irving, knifed him in a hotel room, and then tried to commit suicide; and the morning after Booth shot Lincoln, another of his sweethearts, Ella Turner, an inmate of a Washington “parlor house,” was so distressed to learn that her lover had turned murderer and fled the city, that she clasped his picture to her heart, took chloroform, and lay down to die.

But did this flood of female adulation bring happiness to Booth? Very little, for his triumphs were confined almost wholly to the less discriminating audiences of the hinterland, while there was gnawing at his heart a passionate ambition to win the plaudits of the metropolitan centers.

But New York critics thought poorly of him, and in Philadelphia he was hooted off the stage.

This was galling, for other members of the Booth family were famous on the stage. For well-nigh a third of a century, his father, Junius Brutus Booth, had been a theatrical star of the first magnitude. His Shakesperian interpretations were the talk of the nation. No one else in the history of the American stage had ever won such extraordinary popularity. And the old man Booth had reared his favorite son, John Wilkes, to believe that he was to be the greatest of the Booths.

But the truth is that John Wilkes Booth possessed very little talent, and he didn't make the most of the trifling amount he did have. He was good-looking and spoiled and lazy, and he refused to bore himself with study. Instead, he spent his youthful days on horseback, dashing through the woods of the Maryland farm, spouting heroic speeches to the trees and squirrels, and jabbing the air with an old army lance that had been used in the Mexican War.

Old Junius Brutus Booth never permitted meat to be served at the family table, and he taught his sons that it was wrong to kill any living thing—even a rattlesnake. But John Wilkes evidently was not seriously restrained by his father's philosophy. He liked to shoot and destroy. Sometimes he banged away with his gun at the cats and hound dogs belonging to the slaves, and once he killed a sow owned by a neighbor.

Later he became an oyster pirate in Chesapeake Bay, then an actor. Now, at twenty-six, he was a favorite of gushing highschool girls, but, in his own eyes, he was a failure. And besides, he was bitterly jealous, for he saw his elder brother, Edwin, achieving the very renown that he himself so passionately desired.

He brooded over this a long time, and finally decided to make himself forever famous in one night.

This was his first plan: He would follow Lincoln to the theater some night; and, while one of his confederates turned off the gas-lights, Booth would dash into the President's box, rope and tie him, toss him onto the stage below, hustle him through a back exit, pitch him into a carriage, and scurry away like mad in the darkness.

By hard driving, he could reach the sleepy old town of Port Tobacco before dawn. Then he would row across the broad Potomac, and gallop on south through Virginia until he had lodged the Commander-in-Chief of the Union Army safely behind the Confederate bayonets in Richmond.

And then what?

Well, then the South could dictate terms and bring the war to an end at once.

And the credit for this brilliant achievement would go to whom? To the dazzling genius John Wilkes Booth. He would become twice as famous, a hundred times as famous as his brother Edwin. He would be crowned in history with the aura of a William Tell. Such were his dreams.

He was making twenty thousand dollars a year then in the theater, but he gave it all up. Money meant little to him now, for he was playing for something far more important than material possessions. So he used his savings to finance a band of Confederates that he fished out of the backwash of Southern sympathizers floating around Baltimore and Washington. Booth promised each one of them that he should be rich and famous.

And what a motley crew they were! There was Spangler, a drunken stage-hand and crab-fisherman; Atzerodt, an ignorant house-painter and blockade-runner with stringy hair and whiskers, a rough, fierce fellow; Arnold, a lazy farm-hand and a deserter from the Confederate Army; O'Laughlin, a livery-stable worker, smelling of horses and whisky; Surratt, a swaggering nincompoop of a clerk; Powell, a gigantic penniless brute, the wild-eyed, half-mad son of a Baptist preacher; Herold, a silly, giggling loafer, lounging about stables, talking horses and women, and living on the dimes and quarters given him by his widowed mother and his seven sisters.

With this supporting cast of tenth-raters, Booth was preparing to play the great role of his career. He spared neither time nor money in planning the minutest details. He purchased a pair of handcuffs, arranged for relays of fast horses at the proper places, bought three boats, and had them waiting in Port Tobacco Creek, equipped with oars and rowers ready to man them at a moment's notice.

Finally, in January, 1865, he believed that the great moment had come. Lincoln was to attend Ford's Theater on the eighteenth of that month, to see Edwin Forrest play “Jack Cade.” So the rumor ran about town. And Booth heard it. So he was on hand that night with his ropes and hopes—and what happened? Nothing. Lincoln didn't appear.

Two months later it was reported that Lincoln was going to drive out of the city on a certain afternoon to attend a theatrical performance in a near-by soldiers' encampment. So Booth and his accomplices, mounted on horses and armed with bowieknives and revolvers, hid in a stretch of woods that the President would have to pass. But when the White House carriage rolled by, Lincoln was not in it.

Thwarted again, Booth stormed about, cursing, pulling at his raven-black mustache, and striking his boots with his ridingwhip. He had had enough of this. He was not going to be frustrated any longer. If he couldn't capture Lincoln, by God, he could kill him.

A few weeks later Lee surrendered and ended the war, and Booth saw then that there was no longer any point in kidnapping the President; so he determined to shoot Lincoln at once.

Booth did not have to wait long. The following Friday he had a hair-cut, and then went to Ford's Theater to get his mail. There he learned that a box had been reserved for the President for that night's performance.

“What!” Booth exclaimed. “Is that old scoundrel going to be here to-night?”

Stage-hands were already making ready for a gala performance, draping the left-hand box with flags against a background of lace, decorating it with a picture of Washington, removing the partition, doubling the space, lining it with crimson paper and putting in an unusually large walnut rocking-chair to accommodate the President's long legs.

Booth bribed a stage-hand to place the chair in the precise position that he desired; he wanted it in the angle of the box nearest the audience, so that no one would see him enter. Through the inner door, immediately behind the rocker, he bored a small peep-hole; then dug a notch in the plastering behind the door leading from the dress-circle to the boxes, so that he could bar that entrance with a wooden plank. After that Booth went to his hotel and wrote a long letter to the editor of the “National Intelligencer,” justifying the plotted assassination in the name of patriotism, and declaring that posterity would honor him. He signed it and gave it to an actor, instructing him to have it published the next day.

Then he went to a livery-stable, hired a small bay mare that he boasted could run “like a cat,” and rounded up his assistants and put them on horses; gave Atzerodt a gun, and told him to shoot the Vice-President; and handed a pistol and knife to Powell, ordering him to murder Seward.




It was Good Friday, ordinarily one of the worst nights of the year for the theater, but the town was thronged with officers and enlisted men eager to see the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and the city was still jubilant, celebrating the end of the war. Triumphal arches still spanned Pennsylvania Avenue, and the streets were gay with dancing torch-light processions, shouting with high elation to the President as he drove by that night to the theater. When he arrived at Ford's the house was packed to capacity and hundreds were being turned away.

The President's party entered during the middle of the first act, at precisely twenty minutes to nine. The players paused and bowed. The brilliantly attired audience roared its welcome. The orchestra crashed into “Hail to the Chief.” Lincoln bowed his acknowledgment, parted his coat-tails, and sat down in a walnut rocking-chair upholstered in red.

On Mrs. Lincoln's right sat her guests: Major Rathbone of the Provost-Marshal General's office and his fiancee, Miss Clara H. Harris, the daughter of Senator Ira Harris of New York, blue-bloods high enough in Washington society to meet the fastidious requirements of their Kentucky hostess.

Laura Keene was giving her final performance of the celebrated comedy “Our American Cousin.” It was a gay and joyous occasion; and sparkling laughter rippled back and forth across the audience.

Lincoln had taken a long drive in the afternoon, with his wife; she remarked afterward that he had been happier that day than she had seen him in years. Why shouldn't he be? Peace. Victory. Union. Freedom. He had talked to Mary that afternoon about what they would do when they left the White House at the close of his second term. First, they would take a long rest in either Europe or California; and when they returned, he might open a law office in Chicago, or drift back to Springfield and spend his remaining years riding over the prairie circuit that he loved so well. Some old friends that he had known in Illinois had called at the White House, that same afternoon, and he had been so elated telling jokes that Mrs. Lincoln could hardly get him to dinner.

The night before, he had had a strange dream. He had told the members of his Cabinet about it that morning: “I seemed to be in a singular and indescribable vessel,” he said, “that was moving with great rapidity toward a dark and indefinite shore. I have had this extraordinary dream before great events, before victories. I had it preceding Antietam, Stone River, Gettysburg, Vicksburg.”

He believed that this dream was a good omen, that it foretold good news, that something beautiful was going to happen.




At ten minutes past ten Booth, inflamed with whisky, and dressed in dark riding-breeches, boots, and spurs, entered the theater for the last time in his life—and noted the position of the President. With a black slouch hat in his hand, he mounted the stairs leading to the dress-circle, and edged his way down an aisle choked with chairs, until he came to the corridor leading to the boxes.

Halted by one of the President's guards, Booth handed him his personal card with confidence and bravado, saying that the President wished to see him; and, without waiting for permission, pushed in and closed the corridor door behind him, wedging it shut with a wooden upright from a music-stand.

Peeping through the gimlet-hole that he had bored in the door behind the President, he gaged the distance, and quietly swung the door open. Shoving the muzzle of his high-calibered derringer close to his victim's head, he pulled the trigger and quickly leaped to the stage below.

Lincoln's head fell forward and then sidewise as he slumped in his chair.

He uttered no sound whatever.

For an instant the audience thought that the pistol-shot and the leap to the stage were a part of the play. No one, not even the actors themselves, suspected that the President had been harmed.

Then a woman's shriek pierced the theater and all eyes turned to the draped box. Major Rathbone, blood gushing from one arm, shouted: “Stop that man! Stop him! He has killed the President!”

A moment of silence. A wisp of smoke floating out of the Presidential box. Then the suspense broke. Terror and mad excitement seized the audience. They burst through the seats, wrenching the chairs from the floor, broke over railings, and, trying to clamber upon the stage, tore one another down and trampled upon the old and feeble. Bones were broken in the crush, women screamed and fainted, and shrieks of agony mingled with fierce yells of “Hang him!”... “Shoot him!”... “Burn the theater!”

Some one shouted that the playhouse itself was to be bombed. The fury of the panic doubled and trebled. A company of frantic soldiers dashed into the theater at double-quick, and charged the audience with muskets and fixed bayonets, shouting: “Get out of here! Damn you, get out!”

Physicians from the audience examined the President's wound; and, knowing it to be fatal, refused to have the dying man jolted over the cobblestones back to the White House. So four soldiers lifted him up—two at his shoulders and two at his feet—and carried his long, sagging body out of the theater and into the street, where blood dripping from his wound reddened the pavement. Men knelt to stain their handkerchiefs with it—handkerchiefs which they would treasure a lifetime, and, dying, bequeath as priceless legacies to their children.

With flashing sabers and rearing horses, the cavalry cleared a space; and loving hands bore the stricken President across the street to a cheap lodging-house owned by a tailor, stretched his long frame diagonally across a sagging bed far too short for him, and pulled the bed over to a dismal gas-jet that flickered yellow light.

It was a hall room nine by seventeen feet in size, with a cheap reproduction of Rosa Bonheur's painting of “The Horse Fair” hanging above the bed.

The news of the tragedy swept over Washington like a tornado; and, racing in its wake, came the impact of another disaster: at the same hour of the attack on Lincoln, Secretary Seward had been stabbed in bed and was not expected to live. Out of these black facts, fearsome rumors shot through the night like chain-lightning: Vice-President Johnson had been slain. Stanton had been assassinated. Grant shot. So ran the wild tales.

People were sure now that Lee's surrender had been a ruse, that the Confederates had treacherously crept into Washington and were trying to wipe out the Government with one blow, that the Southern legions had sprung to arms again, that the war, bloodier than ever, was starting once more.

Mysterious messengers dashed through the residence districts, striking the pavement two short staccato raps, thrice repeated—the danger-call of a secret society, the Union League. Awakened by the summons, members grasped their rifles and rushed wildly into the street.

Mobs with torches and ropes boiled through the town, howling: “Burn the theater!”... “Hang the traitor!”... “Kill the rebels!”

It was one of the maddest nights this nation has ever known!

The telegraph flashed the news, setting the nation on fire. Southern sympathizers and copperheads were ridden on rails and tarred and feathered; the skulls of some were crushed with paving-stones. Photograph galleries in Baltimore were stormed and wrecked because they were believed to contain pictures of Booth; and a Maryland editor was shot because he had published some scurrilous abuse of Lincoln.

With the President dying; with Johnson, the Vice-President, sprawled on his bed stone-drunk and his hair matted with mud; with Seward, Secretary of State, stabbed to the verge of death, the reins of power were grasped immediately by Edward M. Stanton, the gruff, erratic, and tempestuous Secretary of War.

Believing that all high officers of the Government were marked for slaughter, Stanton, in wild excitement, dashed off order after order, writing them on the top of his silk hat as he sat by the bedside of his dying chief. He commanded guards to protect his house and the residences of his colleagues; he confiscated Ford's Theater and arrested every one connected with it; he declared Washington to be in a state of siege; he called out the entire military and police force of the District of Columbia, all the soldiers in the surrounding camps, barracks, and fortifications, the Secret Service men of the United States, the spies attached to the Bureau of Military Justice; he threw pickets around the entire city, fifty feet apart; he set a watch at every ferry, and ordered tugs, steamers, and gunboats to patrol the Potomac.

Stanton wired the chief of police in New York to rush him his best detectives, telegraphed orders to watch the Canadian border, and commanded the President of the Baltimore and Ohio Railway to intercept General Grant in Philadelphia and bring him back to Washington at once, running a pilot locomotive ahead of his train.




He poured a brigade of infantry into lower Maryland, and sent a thousand cavalrymen galloping after the assassin, saying over and over: “He will try to get South. Guard the Potomac from the city down.”




The bullet that Booth fired pierced Lincoln's head below the left ear, plowed diagonally through the brain, and lodged within half an inch of the right eye. A man of lesser vitality would have been cut down instantly; but for nine hours Lincoln lived, groaning heavily.

Mrs. Lincoln was kept in an adjoining room; but every hour she would insist on being brought to his bedside, weeping and shrieking, “O my God, have I given my husband to die?”

Once as she was caressing his face and pressing her wet cheek against his, he suddenly began groaning and breathing louder than ever. Screaming, the distraught wife sprang back and fell to the floor in a faint.

Stanton, hearing the commotion, rushed into the room, shouting, “Take that woman away, and don't let her in here again.”

Shortly after seven o'clock the groaning ceased and Lincoln's breathing became quiet. “A look of unspeakable peace,” wrote one of his secretaries who was there, “came over his worn features.”

Sometimes recognition and understanding flash back into the secret chambers of consciousness immediately before dissolution.

In those last peaceful moments broken fragments of happy memories may have floated brightly through the deep hidden caverns of his mind—vanished visions of the long ago: a log fire blazing at night in front of the open shed in the Buckhorn Valley of Indiana; the roar of the Sangamon plunging over the mill-dam at New Salem; Ann Rutledge singing at the spinning-wheel; Old Buck nickering for his corn; Orlando Kellogg telling the story of the stuttering justice; and the law office at Springfield with the ink-stain on the wall and garden seeds sprouting on top of the bookcase....

Throughout the long hours of the death-struggle Dr. Leale, an army surgeon, sat by the President's bedside holding his hand. At twenty-two minutes past seven the doctor folded Lincoln's pulseless arms, put half-dollars on his eyelids to hold them shut, and tied up his jaw with a pocket handkerchief. A clergyman offered a prayer. Cold rain pattered down on the roof. General Barnes drew a sheet over the face of the dead President; and Stanton, weeping and pulling down the windowshades to shut out the light of the dawn, uttered the only memorable sentence of that night: “Now he belongs to the ages.”

The next day little Tad asked a caller at the White House if his father was in heaven.

“I have no doubt of it,” came the reply.

“Then I am glad he has gone,” said Tad, “for he was never happy after he came here. This was not a good place for him.”





PART FOUR


29


The funeral train bearing Lincoln's body back to Illinois crawled through vast crowds of mourning people. The train itself was smothered in crepe; and the engine, like a hearse-horse, was covered with a huge black blanket trimmed with silver stars.

As it steamed northward faces began to appear beside the track—faces that rapidly multiplied in numbers and increased in sadness.

For miles before the train reached the Philadelphia station it ran between solid walls of humanity, and when it rolled into the city thousands of people were milling and jamming through the streets. Mourners stood in lines three miles long, stretching away from Independence Hall. They edged forward, inch by inch, for ten hours in order to look down at last upon Lincoln's face for but one second. On Saturday at midnight the doors were closed, but the mourners, refusing to be dispersed, kept their places all night long and by three o'clock Sunday morning the crowds were greater than ever and boys were selling their places in line for ten dollars.

Soldiers and mounted police fought to keep traffic lanes open, while hundreds of women fainted, and veterans who had fought at Gettysburg collapsed as they struggled to keep order.

For twenty-four hours before the funeral services were scheduled to take place in New York excursion trains running day and night poured into that city the greatest crowds it had ever known—crowds that filled the hotels and overflowed into private homes and backwashed across the parks and onto steamboat piers.

The next day sixteen white horses, ridden by Negroes, pulled the hearse up Broadway, while women, frantic with grief, tossed flowers in its path. Behind came the tramp, tramp, tramp of marching feet—a hundred and sixty thousand mourners with swaying banners bearing quotations like these: “Ah, the pity of it, Iago—the pity of it!”... “Be still, and know that I am God.”

Half a million spectators fought and trampled upon one another in an effort to view the long procession. Second-story windows facing Broadway were rented for forty dollars each, and window-panes were removed in order that the openings might accommodate as many heads as possible.

Choirs robed in white sang hymns on street corners, marching bands wailed their dirges, and at intervals of sixty seconds the roar of a hundred cannon reverberated over the town.

As the crowds sobbed by the bier in City Hall, New York, many spoke to the dead man, some tried to touch his face; and, while the guard was not looking, one woman bent over and kissed the corpse.

When the casket was closed in New York, at noon on Tuesday, thousands who had been unable to view the remains hurried to the trains and sped westward to other points where the funeral car was scheduled to stop. From now on until it reached Springfield the funeral train was seldom out of the sound of tolling bells and booming guns. By day it ran under arches of evergreens and flowers and past hillsides covered with children waving flags; by night its passing was illumined by countless torches and flaming bonfires stretching half-way across the continent.

The country was in a frenzy of excitement. No such funeral had ever before been witnessed, in all history. Weak minds here and there snapped under the strain. A young man in New York slashed his throat with a razor, crying, “I am going to join Abraham Lincoln.”

Forty-eight hours after the assassination a committee from Springfield had hurried to Washington, pleading with Mrs. Lincoln to have her husband buried in his home town. At first, she was sharply opposed to the suggestion. She had hardly a friend left in Springfield, and she knew it. True, she had three sisters living there, but she thoroughly disliked two of them and despised the third one, and she felt nothing but contempt for the rest of the gossiping little village.

“My God, Elizabeth!” she said to her colored dressmaker, “I can never go back to Springfield.”

So she planned to have Lincoln interred in Chicago or placed under the dome of the National Capitol, in the tomb originally constructed for George Washington.

However, after seven days of pleading, she consented to have the body taken back to Springfield. The town raised a public fund, bought a beautiful tract of land consisting of four city blocks—now occupied by the State Capitol—and set men digging day and night.

Finally, on the morning of May 4, the funeral train was in town, the tomb was ready, and thousands of Lincoln's old friends had forgathered for the services, when Mrs. Lincoln, in a sudden rage of erratic temper, countermanded all plans and haughtily decreed that the body must be interred, not where the tomb had been built, but in the Oak Ridge Cemetery, two miles out in the woods.

There were to be no ifs or ands or buts about it. If she did not have her way, she threatened to use “violent” means to carry the remains back to Washington. Why? For a very unlovely reason: the tomb that had been erected in the middle of Springfield stood on what was known as the “Mather block,” and Mrs. Lincoln despised the Mather family. Years before, one of the Mathers had, in some way, aroused her fiery wrath; and now, even in the hushed presence of death, she still cherished her bitter resentment, and would not consent to let Lincoln's body lie for one single night on ground that had been contaminated by the Mathers.

For a quarter of a century this woman had lived under the same roof with a husband who had had “malice toward none,” and “charity for all.” But like the Bourbon kings of France, she had learned nothing, she had forgotten nothing.

Springfield had to bow to the widow's mandate; and so at eleven o'clock the remains were taken out to a public vault in Oak Ridge Cemetery. Fighting Joe Hooker rode ahead of the hearse; and behind it was led Old Buck, covered with a red, white, and blue blanket on which were embroidered the words, “Old Abe's Horse.”

By the time Old Buck got back to his stable, there was not a shred of the blanket left; souvenir-hunters had stripped him bare. And, like buzzards, they swooped down upon the empty hearse, snatching at the draperies and fighting over it until soldiers charged them with bayonets.




For five weeks after the assassination Mrs. Lincoln lay weeping in the White House, refusing to leave her chamber night or day.

Elizabeth Keckley, who was at her bedside during all this time, wrote:

I shall never forget the scene. The wails of a broken heart, the unearthly shrieks, the terrible convulsions, the wild, tempestuous outbursts of grief from the soul. I bathed Mrs. Lincoln's head with cold water, and soothed the terrible tornado as best I could.

Tad's grief at his father's death was as great as the grief of his mother, but her terrible outbursts awed the boy into silence....

Often at night, when Tad would hear her sobbing, he would get up, and come to her bed in his white sleeping-clothes: “Don't cry, Mamma; I can't sleep if you cry! Papa was good, and he has gone to Heaven. He is happy there. He is with God and brother Willie. Don't cry, Mamma, or I will cry too.”

The instant that Booth fired at Lincoln, Major Rathbone, who was sitting in the box with the President, leaped up and grabbed the assassin. But he couldn't hold him, for Booth slashed at him desperately with a bowie-knife, cutting deep gashes in the major's arm. Tearing himself from Major Rathbone's grasp, Booth sprang over the railing of the box and leaped to the stage floor, twelve feet below. But, as he jumped, he caught his spur in the folds of the flag that draped the President's box, fell awkwardly, and broke the small bone in his left leg.

A spasm of pain shot through him. He did not wince or hesitate. He was acting now the supreme role of his career: this was the scene that was to make his name immortal.

Quickly recovering himself, he brandished his dagger, shouted the motto of Virginia, Sic semper tyrannis—“Thus ever to tyrants”—plunged across the stage, knifed a musician who accidentally got in his way, floored an actress, darted out at the back door, jumped upon his waiting horse, raised the butt of his revolver and knocked down the boy, “Peanut John,” who was holding the animal, and spurred madly down the street, the steel shoes from his little horse striking fire from the cobblestones in the night.

For two miles he raced on through the city, passing the Capitol grounds. As the moon rose above the tree-tops he galloped on to the Anacostia bridge. There Sergeant Cobb, the Union sentry, dashed out with rifle and bayonet, demanding:

“Who are you? And why are you out so late? Don't you know it is against the rules to let any one pass after nine o'clock?”

Booth, strange to relate, confessed his real name, saying that he lived in Charles County, and, being in town on business, he had waited for the moon to come up and light him home.

That sounded plausible enough; and, anyway, the war was over, so why make a fuss? Sergeant Cobb lowered his rifle and let the rider pass.

A few minutes later Davy Herold, one of Booth's confederates, hurried across the Anacostia bridge with a similar explanation, joined Booth at their rendezvous, and the two of them raced on through the shadows of lower Maryland, dreaming of the wild acclaim that was sure to be theirs in Dixie.

At midnight they halted in front of a friendly tavern in Surrattville; watered their panting horses; called for the field-glasses, guns, and ammunition that had been left there that afternoon by Mrs. Surratt; drank a dollar's worth of whisky; then, boasting that they had shot Lincoln, spurred on into the darkness.

Originally they had planned to ride from here straight for the Potomac, expecting to reach the river early the next morning and row across at once to Virginia. That sounded easy, and they might have done it and never have been captured at all, except for one thing. They could not foresee Booth's broken leg.

But, despite the pain, Booth galloped on that night with Spartan fortitude—galloped on, although the broken, jagged bone was, as he recorded in his diary, “tearing the flesh at every jump” of his horse. Finally when he could endure the punishment no longer, he and Herold swung their horses off to the left, and shortly before daybreak on Saturday morning reined up in front of the house of a country physician named Mudd—Dr. Samuel A. Mudd—who lived twenty miles southeast of Washington.

Booth was so weak and he was suffering so intensely that he couldn't dismount alone. He had to be lifted out of his saddle and carried groaning to an unstairs bedroom. There were no telegraph lines or railways in this isolated region; so none of the natives had yet learned of the assassination. Hence, the doctor suspected nothing. How had Booth come to break his leg? That was simple as Booth explained it—his horse had fallen on him. Dr. Mudd did for Booth what he would have done for any other suffering man; he cut away the boot from the left leg, set the fractured bone, tied it up with pasteboard splints made from a hat-box, fashioned a rude crutch for the cripple, and gave him a shoe to travel with.

Booth slept all that day at Dr. Mudd's house, but as twilight drew on he edged out of the bed painfully. Refusing to eat anything, he shaved off his handsome mustache, threw a long gray shawl around his shoulders so that the end of it would cover the telltale initials tattooed upon his right hand, disguised himself with a set of false whiskers, and paid the doctor twenty-five dollars in greenbacks. Then once more he and Herold mounted their horses and headed for the river of their hopes.

But directly across their path lay the great Zekiah Swamp, a huge bog matted with brush and dogwood, oozy with mud and slimy with stagnant pools—the home of lizards and snakes. In the darkness the two riders missed their way and for hours wandered about, lost.

Late in the night they were rescued by a negro, Oswald Swann. The pain in Booth's leg was so excruciating now that he couldn't sit astride his horse; so he gave Swarm seven dollars to haul him the rest of the night in his wagon, and as dawn was breaking on Easter Sunday the driver halted his white mules before “Rich Hill,” the home of a wealthy, well-known Confederate, Captain Cox.

Thus ended the first lap of Booth's futile race for life.

Booth told Captain Cox who he was and what he had done; and, to prove his identity, he showed his initials tattooed in India ink on his hand.

He implored Captain Cox, in the name of his mother, not to betray him, pleading that he was sick and crippled and suffering, and declaring that he had done what he thought was best for the South.

Booth was in such a condition now that he couldn't travel any farther, either on horseback or by wagon; so Captain Cox hid the two fugitives in a thicket of pines near his house. The place was more than a thicket, it was a veritable jungle densely undergrown with laurel and holly; and there, for the next six days and five nights, the fugitives waited for Booth's wounded leg to improve enough to permit them to continue their flight.

Captain Cox had a foster-brother, Thomas A. Jones. Jones was a slave-owner, and for years he had been an active agent of the Confederate Government, ferrying fugitives and contraband mail across the Potomac. Captain Cox urged Jones to look after Herold and Booth; so every morning he brought them food in a basket. Knowing that each wood-path was being searched and that spies were everywhere, he called his hogs as he carried the basket and pretended to be feeding his live stock.

Booth, hungry as he was for food, was hungrier still for information. He kept begging Jones to tell him the news, to let him know how the nation was applauding his act.

Jones brought him newspapers, and Booth devoured them eagerly, searching in vain, however, for the burst of acclaim he had coveted so passionately. He found in them only disillusion and heartbreak.

For more than thirty hours he had been racing toward Virginia, braving the tortures of the flesh. But, violent as they had been, they were easy to endure compared with the mental anguish that he suffered now. The fury of the North—that was nothing, he had expected that. But when the Virginia papers showed that the South — his South—had turned upon him, condemning and disowning him, he was frantic with disappointment and despair. He, who had dreamed of being honored as a second Brutus and glorified as a modern William Tell, now found himself denounced as a coward, a fool, a hireling, a cutthroat.

These attacks stung him like the sting of an adder. They were bitter as death.

But did he blame himself? No. Far from it. He blamed everybody else—everybody except himself and God. He had been merely an instrument in the hands of the Almighty. That was his defense. He had been divinely appointed to shoot Abraham Lincoln, and his only mistake had been in serving a people “too degenerate” to appreciate him. That was the phrase he set down in his diary—“too degenerate.”

“If the world knew my heart,” he wrote, “that one blow would have made me great, though I did not desire greatness.... I have too great a soul to die like a criminal.”

Lying there, shivering under a horse-blanket, on the damp ground near Zekiah Swamp, he poured out his aching heart in tragic bombast:

Wet, cold and starving, with every man's hand against me, I am here in despair, and why? For doing what Brutus was honored for—for what made Tell a hero. I have stricken down a greater tyrant than they ever knew, and I am looked upon as a common cut-throat; yet my action was purer than either of theirs.... I hoped for no gain.... I think I have done well, I do not repent the blow I struck.

As Booth lay there writing, three thousand detectives and ten thousand cavalrymen were scouring every nook and corner of southern Maryland, searching houses, exploring caves, ransacking buildings, and fine-tooth-combing even the slimy bogs of Zekiah Swamp, determined to hunt Booth down and bring him in, dead or alive, and claim the various rewards—approximating a hundred thousand dollars, offered for his capture. Sometimes he could hear the cavalry who were hunting him, galloping by on a public road only two hundred yards away.

At times he could hear their horses neighing and whinnying and calling to one another. Suppose his and Herold's horses should answer them. That would probably mean capture. So that night Herold led their horses down into Zekiah Swamp and shot them.

Two days later buzzards appeared! Specks in the sky at first, they winged closer and closer, finally wheeling and soaring and soaring and wheeling directly above the dead animals. Booth was frightened. The buzzards might attract the attention of the pursuers, who would almost certainly recognize the body of his bay mare.

Besides, he had decided that he must somehow get to another doctor.

So the next night, Friday, April 21—one week after the assassination—he was lifted from the ground and put astride a horse belonging to Thomas A. Jones, and once more he and Herold set out for the Potomac.

The night was ideal for their purposes: dense with a misty fog, and so dark that the men literally had to feel for one another in the inky blackness.

Jones, faithful dog that he was, piloted them from their hiding-place to the river, stealing through open fields, over a public highway, and across a farm. Realizing that soldiers and Secret Service men were swarming everywhere, Jones would steal ahead fifty yards at a time, stop, listen, and give a low whistle. Then Booth and Herold would advance to him.

In that way, slowly, startled by the slightest noise, they traveled for hours, reaching at last the steep and crooked path that led from the bluff down to the river. A stiff wind had been blowing that day; and, through the darkness, they could hear the mournful sound of the water pounding on the sand below.

For almost a week the Union soldiers had been riding up and down the Potomac, destroying every boat on the Maryland shore. But Jones had outwitted them: he had had his colored man, Henry Rowland, using the boat to fish for shad every day, and had had it hidden in Dent's meadow every night.

So when the fugitives reached the water's edge this evening everything was in readiness. Booth whispered his thanks to Jones, paid him seventeen dollars for his boat and a bottle of whisky, climbed in, and headed for a spot on the Virginia shore five miles away.

All through the foggy, ink-black night Herold pulled at the oars while Booth sat in the stern, trying to navigate with compass and candle.

But they hadn't gone far when they struck a flood-tide which is very strong at this point, owing to the narrowness of the channel. It swept them up the river for miles, and they lost their bearings in the fog. After dodging the Federal gunboats that were patrolling the Potomac, they found themselves, at dawn, ten miles up the river, but not one foot nearer to the Virginia shore than they had been the night before.

So they hid all that day in the swamps of Nanjemoy Cove; and the next night, wet and hungry, they pulled across the river; and Booth exclaimed: “I am safe at last, thank God, in glorious old Virginia.”

Hurrying to the home of Dr. Richard Stewart, who was an agent for the Confederate Government and the richest man in King George County, Virginia, Booth expected to be welcomed as the saviour of the South. But the doctor had already been arrested several times for aiding the Confederacy, and, now that the war was over, he wasn't going to risk his neck by helping the man who had killed Lincoln. He was too shrewd for that. So he wouldn't let Booth even enter his house. He did give the fugitives a little food, grudgingly, but he made them eat it in the barn, and then sent them to sleep that night with a family of negroes.

And even the negroes didn't want Booth. He had to frighten them into letting him stay with them.

And this in Virginia!

In Virginia, mind you, where he had confidently expected the very hills to reverberate with the lusty cheers that would greet the mere mention of his name.

The end was drawing near now. It came three days later. Booth had not gotten far. He had ferried across the Rappahannock at Port Royal, in the company of three Confederate cavalrymen returning from the war, had ridden one of their horses three miles farther South, and, with their help, had then palmed himseif off on a farmer, saying that his name was Boyd and that he had been wounded in Lee's army near Richmond.

And so for the next two days, Booth stayed at the Garrett farm-house, sunning himself on the lawn, suffering from his wound, consulting an old map, studying a route to the Rio Grande, and making notes of the road to Mexico.

The first evening he was there, while he sat at the supper table, Garrett's young daughter began babbling about the news of the assassination, which she had just heard through a neighbor. She talked on and on, wondering who had done it and how much the assassin had been paid for it.

“In my opinion,” Booth suddenly remarked, “he wasn't paid a cent, but did it for the sake of notoriety.”

The next afternoon, April 25, Booth and Herold were stretched out under the locust trees in the Garrett yard, when suddenly Major Ruggles, one of the Confederate cavalrymen who had helped them across the Rappahannock, dashed up and shouted: “The Yanks are crossing the river. Take care of yourself.”

They scurried away to the woods, but when darkness fell they stole back to the house.

To Garrett, that looked suspicious. He wanted to get rid of his mysterious “guests” at once. Was it because he suspected that they might have shot Lincoln? No, he never even thought of that. He imagined they were horse-thieves. When they said at the supper table that they wanted to buy two horses, his suspicions grew, and when bedtime came, and the fugitives, thinking of their safety, refused to go upstairs and insisted on sleeping under the porch or in the barn—then all doubt was removed.

Garrett was positive now that they were horse-thieves. So he put them in an old tobacco warehouse that was being used then for storing hay and furniture—put them in and locked them in with a padlock. And finally, as a double precaution, the old farmer sent his two sons, William and Henry, tiptoeing out in the darkness with blankets, to spend the night in an adjoining corn-crib, where they could watch and see that no horses were whisked away during the night.

The Garrett family went to bed, that memorable evening, half expecting a little excitement.

And they got it before morning.

For two days and nights, a troop of Union soldiers had been hot on the trail of Booth and Herold, picking up clue after clue, talking to an old negro who had seen them crossing the Potomac, and finding Rollins, the colored ferryman who had poled them across the Rappahannock in a scow. This ferryman told them that the Confederate soldier who had given Booth a lift on his horse as they rode away from the river was Captain Willie Jett, and that the captain had a sweetheart who lived in Bowling Green, twelve miles away. Perhaps he had gone there.

That sounded likely enough, so the troopers climbed quickly into their saddles and spurred on in the moonlight toward Bowling Green. Arriving there at midnight, they thundered into the house, found Captain Jett, jerked him out of his bed, thrust a revolver against his ribs, and demanded:

“Where is Booth? Damn your soul, where did you hide him? Tell us or we'll blow your heart out.”

Jett saddled his pony, and led the Northern men back to the Garrett farm.

The night was black, the moon having gone down, and there were no stars. For nine miles the dust rose in choking clouds under the galloping feet of the horses. Soldiers rode one on each side of Jett, with the reins of his horse tied to their saddles, so that he couldn't escape in the dark.

At half-past three in the morning the troopers arrived in front of the worn old whitewashed Garrett house.

Quickly, quietly, they surrounded the house and trained their guns on every door and window. Their leader banged on the porch with his pistol butt, demanding admittance.

Presently Richard Garrett, candle in hand, unbolted the door, while the dogs barked furiously, and the wind whipped the tail of his night-shirt against his trembling legs.

Quickly Lieutenant Baker grabbed him by the throat, thrusting a pistol to his head and demanding that he hand over Booth.

The old man, tongue-tied with terror, swore that the strangers were not in the house, that they had gone to the woods.

That was a lie, and it sounded like it; so the troopers jerked him out of the doorway, dangled a rope in his face, and threatened to string him up at once to a locust tree in the yard.

At that instant one of the Garrett boys who had been sleeping in the corn-crib ran up to the house and told the truth. With a rush the troopers encircled the tobacco barn.

There was a lot of talk before the shooting started. For fifteen or twenty minutes the Northern officers argued with Booth, urging him to surrender. He shouted back that he was a cripple, and asked them to “give a lame man a show,” offering to come out and fight the entire squad one by one, if they would withdraw a hundred yards.

Herold lost his courage and wanted to surrender. Booth was disgusted.

“You damned coward,” he shouted, “get out of here. I don't want you to stay.”

And out Herold went, his arms in front of him, ready to be handcuffed, while he pleaded for mercy, declaring from time to time that he liked Mr. Lincoln's jokes, and swearing that he had had no part in the asassination.

Colonel Conger tied him to a tree and threatened to gag him unless he ceased his silly whimpering.

But Booth would not surrender. He felt that he was acting for posterity. He shouted to his pursuers that the word “surrender” was not in his vocabulary, and he warned them to prepare a stretcher for him as they put “one more stain on the glorious old banner.”

Colonel Conger resolved to smoke him out, and ordered one of the Garrett boys to pile dry brush against the barn. Booth saw the boy doing it, and cursed him and threatened to put a bullet through him if he didn't stop. He did stop, but Colonel Conger slipped around to a corner of the barn in the rear, pulled a wisp of hay through a crack, and lighted it with a match.

The barn had originally been built for tobacco, with spacings four inches wide left to let in the air. Through these spacings the troopers saw Booth pick up a table to fight the mounting fire—an actor in the limelight for the last time, a tragedian playing the closing scene of his farewell performance.

Strict orders had been given to take Booth alive. The Government didn't want him shot. It wanted to have a big trial and then hang him.

And possibly he might have been taken alive had it not been for a half-cracked sergeant—“Boston” Corbett, a religious fanatic.

Every one had been warned repeatedly not to shoot without orders. Corbett afterward declared that he had had orders —orders direct from God Almighty.

Through the wide cracks of the burning barn, “Boston” saw Booth throw away his crutch, drop his carbine, raise his revolver, and spring for the door.

“Boston” was positive that he would shoot his way out and make a last, desperate dash for liberty, firing as he ran.

So, to prevent any futile bloodshed, Corbett stepped forward, rested his pistol across his arm, took aim through a crack, prayed for Booth's soul, and pulled the trigger.

At the crack of the pistol Booth shouted, leaped a foot in the air, plunged forward, and fell face down on the hay, mortally wounded.

The roaring flames were moving rapidly now across the dry hay. Lieutenant Baker, eager to get the dying wretch out of the place before he was roasted, rushed into the flaming building and leaped upon him, wrenching his revolver from his clenched fist and pinioning his arms to his side for fear that he might merely be feigning death.

Quickly Booth was carried to the porch of the farmhouse, and a soldier mounted a horse and spurred down the dusty road three miles to Port Royal for a physician.

Mrs. Garrett had a sister, Miss Halloway, who was boarding with her and teaching school. When Miss Halloway realized that the dying man there under the honeysuckle vine on the porch was the romantic actor and great lover, John Wilkes Booth, she said he must be cared for tenderly, and she had a mattress hauled out for him to lie upon; and then she brought out her own pillow, put it under his head, and, taking his head upon her lap, offered him wine. But his throat seemed paralyzed, and he couldn't swallow. Then she dipped her handkerchief in water and moistened his lips and tongue time after time, and massaged his temples and forehead.

The dying man struggled on for two and a half hours, suffering intensely; begging to be turned on his face, his side, his back; coughing and urging Colonel Conger to press his hands down hard upon his throat; and crying out in his agony: “Kill me! Kill me!”

Pleading to have a last message sent to his mother, he whispered haltingly:

“Tell her... I did... what I thought... was best... and that I died... for my country.”

As the end drew near, he asked to have his hands raised so he could look at them; but they were totally paralyzed, and he muttered:

“Useless! Useless!”

They were his last words.

He died just as the sun was rising above the tops of the venerable locust trees in the Garrett yard. His “jaw drew spasmodically and obliquely downward, his eyeballs rolled toward his feet and began to swell... and with a sort of gurgle, and sudden check, he stretched his feet and threw back his head.” It was the end.

It was seven o'clock. He had died within twenty-two minutes of the time of day Lincoln had died; and “Boston” Corbett's bullet had struck Booth in the back of the head, about an inch below the spot where he himself had wounded Lincoln.

The doctor cut off a curl of Booth's hair, and gave it to Miss Halloway. She kept the lock of hair and the bloody pillowslip on which his head had lain—kept them and cherished them until, finally, in later years, poverty overtook her and she was obliged to trade half of the stained pillow-slip for a barrel of flour.

Booth had hardly ceased breathing before the detectives were kneeling to search him. They found a pipe, a bowie-knife, two revolvers, a diary, a compass greasy with candle drippings, a draft on a Canadian bank for about three hundred dollars, a diamond pin, a nail file, and the photographs of five beautiful women who had adored him. Four were actresses: Effie Germon, Alice Grey, Helen Western, and “Pretty Fay Brown.” The fifth was a Washington society woman, whose name has been withheld out of respect for her descendants.

Then Colonel Doherty jerked a saddle-blanket off a horse, borrowed a needle from Mrs. Garrett, sewed the corpse up in the blanket, and gave an old Negro, Ned Freeman, two dollars to haul the body to the Potomac, where a ship was waiting.

On page 505 of his book entitled the “History of the United States Secret Service” Lieutenant La Fayette C. Baker tells the story of that trip to the river:

When the wagon started, Booth's wound, now scarcely dribbling, began to run anew. Blood fell through the crack of the wagon, and fell dripping upon the axle, and spotting the road with terrible wafers. It stained the planks and soaked the blankets... and all the way blood dribbled from the corpse in a slow, incessant, sanguine exudation.

In the midst of all this an unexpected thing happened. Ned Freeman's old wagon, according to Baker, was “a very shaky and absurd” contraption “which rattled like approaching dissolution.” It not only “rattled like approaching dissolution,” but under the strain and speed of the trip, the rickety old wagon actually began to dissolve there on the roadway. A king-bolt snapped, the wagon pulled apart, the front wheels tore away from the hind ones, the front end of the box fell to the ground with a thud, and Booth's body lurched “forward as if in a last effort to escape.”

Lieutenant Baker abandoned the rickety old death-car, commandeered another wagon from a neighboring farmer, pitched Booth's body into that, hurried on to the river, and stowed the corpse aboard a government tug, the John S. Ide, which chugged away with it to Washington.

At dawn the next morning the news spread through the city: Booth had been shot. His body was lying that very minute on the gunboat Montauk, riding at anchor in the Potomac.

The capital was thrilled, and thousands hurried down to the river, staring in grim fascination at the death-ship.

In the middle of the afternoon Colonel Baker, chief of the Secret Service, rushed to Stanton with the news that he had caught a group of civilians on board the Montauk, in direct violation of orders, and that one of them, a woman, had cut off a lock of Booth's hair.

Stanton was alarmed. “Every one of Booth's hairs,” he cried, “will be cherished as a relic by the rebels.”

He feared that they might become far more than mere relics. Stanton firmly believed that the assassination of Lincoln was part of a sinister plot conceived and directed by Jefferson Davis and the leaders of the Confederacy. And he feared that they might capture Booth's body and use it in a crusade to fire the Southern slaveholders to spring to their rifles once more and begin the war all over again.

He decreed that Booth must be buried with all possible haste, and buried secretly; he must be hidden away and blotted out of existence, with no trinket, no shred of his garments, no lock of his hair, nothing left for the Confederates to use in a crusade.

Stanton issued his orders; and that evening, as the sun sank behind a fiery bank of clouds, two men—Colonel Baker and his cousin, Lieutenant Baker—stepped into a skiff, pulled over to the Montauk, boarded her, and did three things in plain sight of the gaping throng on the shore:

First, they lowered Booth's body, now incased in a pine gun-box, over the side of the ship and down into the skiff; next, they lowered a huge ball and heavy chain; then they climbed in themselves, shoved off, and drifted downstream.

The curious crowd on the shore did precisely what the detectives had expected them to do: they raced along the bank, shoving, splashing, talking excitedly, determined to watch the funeral ship and see where the body was sunk.

For two miles they kept even with the drifting detectives. Then darkness crept up the river, clouds blotted out the moon and the stars, and even the sharpest eyes could no longer make out the tiny skiff in midstream.

By the time the detectives reached Geeseborough Point, one of the loneliest spots on the Potomac, Colonel Baker was sure that they were completely hidden from view; so he headed the skiff into the great swamp that begins there—a malodorous spot, rank with rushes and slough weeds, a burial-ground where the army cast its condemned horses and dead mules.

Here, in this eerie morass, the two detectives waited for hours, listening to find out if they had been followed; but the only sounds they could hear were the cry of bullfrogs and the ripple of the water among the sedges.

Midnight came; and, with breathless quiet and the utmost caution, the two men rowed stealthily back up-stream, fearing to whisper, and dreading even the lisping of the oars and the lapping of the water at the gunwales.

They finally reached the walls of the old penitentiary, rowed to a spot where a hole had been chopped in the solid masonry near the water's edge to let them in. Giving the countersign to the officer who challenged them, they handed over a white pine casket with the name “John Wilkes Booth” printed on the lid; and, half an hour later, it was buried in a shallow hole in the southwest corner of a large room in the government arsenal where ammunition was stored. The top of the grave was carefully smoothed over, so that it looked like the rest of the dirt floor.

By sunrise the next morning excited men with grapplinghooks were dragging the Potomac, and raking and prodding among the carcasses of dead mules in the great swamp behind Geeseborough Point.

All over the nation millions were asking what had been done with Booth's body. Only eight men knew the answer—eight loyal men who were sworn never to disclose the secret.

In the midst of all this mystery, wild rumors sprang into existence and newspapers broadcast them over the land. Booth's head and heart had been deposited in the Army Medical Museum at Washington—so said the “Boston Advertiser.” Other papers stated that the corpse had been buried at sea. Still others declared it had been burned; and a weekly magazine published an “eye-witness” sketch, showing it being sunk in the Potomac at midnight.

Out of the welter of contradiction and confusion another rumor arose: the soldiers had shot the wrong man, and Booth had escaped.

Probably this rumor arose because Booth dead looked so different from Booth alive. One of the men Stanton ordered to go aboard the gunboat Montauk on April 27, 1865, and identify the body, was Dr. John Frederick May, an eminent physician of Washington. Dr. May said that when the tarpaulin that covered the remains was removed—

to my great astonishment, there was revealed a body in whose lineaments there was to me no resemblance to the man I had known in life. My surprise was so great that I at once said to General Barnes: “There is no resemblance in that corpse to Booth, nor can I believe it to be that of him.”... It being afterwards, by my request, placed in a sitting position, standing and looking down upon it, I was finally enabled to imperfectly recognize the features of Booth. But never in a human being had a greater change taken place, from the man whom I had seen in the vigor of life and health, than in that of the haggard corpse which was before me, with its yellow and discolored skin, its unkempt and matted hair, and its whole facial expression sunken and sharpened by the exposure and starvation it had undergone.

Other men who saw the corpse did not recognize Booth even “imperfectly,” and they told their doubts about the city. And the rumor traveled fast.

Matters were not helped by the secrecy with which the Government guarded the body, the speed and mystery of its burial, and Stanton's refusal to give out any information or to deny ugly tales.

The “Constitutional Union,” a paper published in the capital, said the entire performance was a hoax. Other papers joined in the cry. “We know Booth escaped,” echoed the “Richmond Examiner.” The “Louisville Journal” openly contended that there had been something rotten in the whole show, and that “Baker and his associates had wilfully conspired to swindle the United States Treasury.”

The battle raged bitterly; and, as usual in such cases, witnesses sprang up by the hundreds, declaring that they had met Booth and talked to him long after the shooting affray at the Garrett barn. He had been seen here, there, and everywhere: fleeing to Canada, dashing into Mexico, traveling on ships bound for South America, hurrying to Europe, preaching in Virginia, hiding on an island in the Orient.

And so was born the most popular and persistent and mysterious myth in American history. It has lived and thrived for almost three quarters of a century; and, to this day, thousands of people believe it—many of them people of unusual intelligence.

There are even some learned men of the colleges who profess to believe the myth. One of the most prominent churchmen in this country has gone up and down the land, declaring in his lectures to hundreds of audiences that Booth escaped. The author, while writing this chapter, was solemnly informed by a scientifically trained man that Booth had gone free.

Of course, Booth was killed. There can be no doubt of it. The man who was shot in Garrett's tobacco barn used every argument he could think of to save his life; and he had a splendid imagination; but, in his most desperate moments, it never occurred to him to deny that he was John Wilkes Booth. That was too absurd, too fantastic, to try even in the face of death.

And to make doubly sure that it was Booth who had been killed, Stanton sent ten men to identify the corpse after it reached Washington. One, as we have already recorded, was Dr. May. He had cut “a large fibroid tumor” from Booth's neck, and the wound in healing had left “a large and ugly scar.” Dr. May, who identified him by that scar says:

From the body which was produced by the captors, nearly every vestige of resemblance of the living man had disappeared. But the mark made by the scalpel during life remained indelible in death, and settled beyond all question at the time, and all cavil in the future, the identity of the man who had assassinated the President.

Dr. Merrill, a dentist, identified the body by a filling he had recently put into one of Booth's teeth.

Charles Dawson, a clerk in the National Hotel, where Booth had stopped, identified the dead man by the initials “J. W. B.” tattooed on Booth's right hand.

Gardner, the well-known Washington photographer, identified him; and so did Henry Clay Ford, one of Booth's most intimate friends.

When Booth's body was dug up by order of President Andrew Johnson, on February 15, 1869, it was identified again by Booth's close friends.

Then it was taken to Baltimore to be reburied in the Booth family plot in Greenmount Cemetery; but before it was reburied, it was identified again by Booth's brother and mother, and friends who had known him all his life.

It is doubtful whether any other man who ever lived has been as carefully identified in death as Booth was.

And yet the false legend lives on. During the eighties, many people believed that the Rev. J. G. Armstrong of Richmond, Virginia, was Booth in disguise, for Armstrong had coal-black eyes, a lame leg, dramatic ways, and wore his raven hair long to hide a scar on the back of his neck—so people said.

And other “Booths” arose, no less than twenty of them.

In 1872 a “John Wilkes Booth” gave dramatic readings and sleight-of-hand performances before the students of the University of Tennessee; married a widow; tired of her; whispered that he was the real assassin; and, stating that he was going to New Orleans to get a fortune that awaited him, he disappeared, and “Mrs. Booth” never heard of him again.

In the late seventies a drunken saloon-keeper with the asthma, at Granbury, Texas, confessed to a young lawyer named Bates that he was Booth, showed an ugly scar on the back of his neck, and related in detail how Vice-President Johnson had persuaded him to kill Lincoln and promised him a pardon if he should ever be caught.

A quarter of a century passed; and, on January 13, 1903, a drunken house-painter and dope-fiend, David E. George, killed himself with strychnine in the Grand Avenue Hotel in Enid, Oklahoma. But before he destroyed himself, he “confessed” that he was John Wilkes Booth. He declared that after he shot Lincoln, his friends had hidden him in a trunk and got him aboard a ship bound for Europe, where he lived for ten years.

Bates, the lawyer, read about this in the papers, rushed to Oklahoma, looked at the body, and declared that David E. George was none other than the asthmatic saloon-keeper of Granbury, Texas, who had confessed to him twenty-five years before.

Bates had the undertaker comb the corpse's hair just as Booth had worn his; wept over the remains; had the body embalmed; took it back to his home in Memphis, Tennessee, and kept it in his stable for twenty years, while trying to palm it off on the Government and claim the huge reward that had been offered—and paid—for the capture of Booth.

In 1908 Bates wrote a preposterous book entitled: “The Escape and Suicide of John Wilkes Booth, or the First True Account of Lincoln's Assassination, Containing a Complete Confession by Booth, Many Years after His Crime.” He sold seventy thousand copies of his sensational paper-back volume; created a considerable stir; offered his mummified “Booth” to Henry Ford for one thousand dollars; and finally began exhibiting it in side-shows throughout the South, at ten cents a look.

Five different skulls are now being exhibited in carnivals and tents as the skull of Booth.

After she left the White House Mrs. Lincoln got into serious difficulties, and made an exhibition of herself that became national gossip.

In matters of household expense she was excessively penurious. It had long been customary for the Presidents to give a number of state dinners each season. But Mrs. Lincoln argued her husband into breaking the tradition, saying that these dinners were “very costly;” that these were war-times and public receptions would be more “economical.”

Lincoln had to remind her once that “we must think of something besides economy.”

When it came, however, to buying things that appealed to her vanity—such as dresses and jewelry—she not only forgot economy, but seemed bereft of all reason and indulged in a fantastic orgy of spending.

In 1861 she had come off the prairie, confidently expecting that as “Mrs. President” she would be the center of the glittering constellation of Washington society. But to her amazement and humiliation she found herself snubbed and ostracized by the haughty aristocrats of that Southern city. In their eyes, she, a Kentuckian, had been untrue to the South: she had married a crude, awkward “nigger-lover” who was making war upon them.

Besides, she had almost no likable personal qualities. She was, it must be admitted, a mean, common, envious, affected, mannerless virago.

Unable to attain social popularity herself, she was bitterly jealous of those who had achieved it. The then reigning queen of Washington society was the renowned beauty Adele Cutts Douglas, the woman who had married Mrs. Lincoln's former sweetheart, Stephen A. Douglas. The glamorous popularity of Mrs. Douglas and Salmon P. Chase's daughter, inflamed Mrs. Lincoln with envy, and she resolved to win social victories with money—money spent on clothes and jewelry for herself.

“To keep up appearances,” she told Elizabeth Keckley, “I must have money, more money than Mr. Lincoln can spare me. He is too honest to make a penny outside of his salary; consequently, I had, and still have, no alternative but to run in debt.”

In debt she plunged, to the extent of seventy thousand dollars! A staggering sum when we remember that Lincoln's salary as President was only twenty-five thousand, and that it would have taken every penny of his income for over two years and nine months to pay for her finery alone.

I have quoted several times from Elizabeth Keckley. She was an unusually intelligent negro woman who had bought her freedom and come to Washington to set up a dress-making shop. Within a short time she had the patronage of some of the capital's leading social figures.

From 1861 to 1865 she was with Mrs. Lincoln almost daily in the White House, making dresses and serving her as a personal maid. She finally became not only Mrs. Lincoln's confidante and adviser, but her most intimate friend. The night that Lincoln lay dying, the only person Mrs. Lincoln kept calling for was Elizabeth Keckley.

Fortunately for history, Mrs. Keckley wrote a book about her experiences. It has been out of print for half a century, but dilapidated copies can be purchased now and then from rare-book dealers for ten or twenty dollars. The title is rather long: “Behind the Scenes, by Elizabeth Keckley, Formerly a Slave, but More Recently Modiste and Friend to Mrs. Abraham Lincoln: Or Thirty Years a Slave and Four Years in the White House.”

Elizabeth Keckley records that in the summer of 1864, when Lincoln was running for a second term, “Mrs. Lincoln was almost crazy with fear and anxiety.”

Why? One of her New York creditors had threatened to sue her; and the possibility that Lincoln's political enemies might get wind of her debts and use them as political thunder in the bitter campaign, drove her almost to distraction.

“If he is reelected, I can keep him in ignorance of my affairs; but if he is defeated, then the bills will be sent in, and he will know all,” she sobbed hysterically.

“I could go down on my knees,” she cried to Lincoln “and plead for votes for you.”

“Mary,” he remonstrated, “I am afraid you will be punished for this overwhelming anxiety. If I am to be elected, it will be all right; if not, you must bear the disappointment.”

“And does Mr. Lincoln suspect how much you owe?” inquired Mrs. Keckley.

And here was Mrs. Lincoln's answer, as reported on page 150 of “Behind the Scenes:”

“God, no!—this was a favorite expression of hers [Mrs. Lincoln's]— and I would not have him suspect. If he knew that his wife was involved to the extent that she is, the knowledge would drive him mad.”

“The only happy feature of Lincoln's assassination,” says Mrs. Keckley, “was that he died in ignorance of these debts.”

He hadn't been in his grave a week before Mrs. Lincoln was trying to sell his shirts with his initials marked on them, offering them at a shop on Pennsylvania Avenue.

Seward, hearing about it, went, with a heavy heart, and bought up the lot himself.




When Mrs. Lincoln left the White House, she took with her a score of trunks and half a hundred packing-boxes.

That created a good deal of nasty talk.

She had already been repeatedly and publicly accused of swindling the United States Treasury by falsifying an expenseaccount for the entertainment of Prince Napoleon, and her enemies pointed out that though she had come to the Executive Mansion with only a few trunks, she was now leaving it with a whole car-load of stuff.... Why?... Was she looting the place? Had she stripped it bare of everything she could?

Even as late as October 6, 1867—almost two and a half years after she left Washington—the “Cleveland Herald,” speaking of Mrs. Lincoln, said:

“Let the country know that it required one hundred thousand dollars to make good the spoliation at the White House, and let it be proved who had the benefit of such plundering.”

True, a great many things were stolen from the White House during the reign of the “rosy empress,” but the fault was hardly hers. She made mistakes, of course: one of the first things she did was to discharge the steward and a number of the other employees, saying she was going to superintend the place herself, and put it on an economical basis.

She tried it, and the servants purloined almost everything except the door-knobs and the kitchen stove. The “Washington Star” for March 9, 1861, records that many of the guests who attended the first White House reception lost their overcoats and evening wraps. It wasn't long before even the White House furnishings were being carted away.

Fifty packing-boxes and a score of trunks! What was in them? Trash, for the most part: useless gifts, statuary, worthless pictures and books, wax wreaths, deer-heads, and a lot of old clothes and hats hopelessly outmoded—things she had worn back in Springfield years before.

“She had a passion,” says Mrs. Keckley, “for hoarding old things.”

While she was packing, her son Robert, recently graduated from Harvard, advised her to put a match to the old trumpery. When she scorned the idea, he said:

“I hope to heaven that the car that carries these boxes to Chicago catches fire and burns up all your old plunder.”

The morning Mrs. Lincoln drove away from the White House, “there was scarcely a friend to tell her good-by,” records Mrs. Keckley. “The silence was almost painful.”

Even Andrew Johnson, the new President, failed to bid her farewell. In fact, he never even wrote her a line of sympathy after the assassination. He knew that she despised him, and he reciprocated her feelings.

Absurd as it seems now in the light of history, Mrs. Lincoln firmly believed then that Andrew Johnson had been back of the plot to assassinate Lincoln.

With her two sons, Tad and Robert, Lincoln's widow traveled to Chicago, stopped for a week at the Tremont House, found it too expensive, and moved to some “small, plainly-furnished” rooms at a summer resort called Hyde Park.

Sobbing because she couldn't afford better living quarters, she refused to see or even correspond with any of her former friends or relatives, and settled down to teaching Tad to spell.

Tad had been his father's favorite. His real name was Thomas, but Lincoln had nicknamed him “Tad” or “Tadpole” because as a baby he had had an abnormally large head.

Tad usually slept with his father. The child would he around the office in the White House until he fell asleep, and then the President would shoulder him and carry him off to bed. Tad had always suffered from a slight impediment in his speech, and his father humored him; and, so with the ingenuity of a bright boy, he used his handicap as a foil to ward off attempts to educate him. He was now twelve years old, but he could neither read nor write.

Mrs. Keckley records that during his first spelling lesson, Tad spent ten minutes arguing that “a-p-e” spelled monkey. The word was illustrated with a small woodcut of what he believed to be a monkey, and it required the combined efforts of three people to convince him that he was wrong.

Mrs. Lincoln used every means in her power to persuade Congress to give her the hundred thousand dollars that Lincoln would have been paid had he lived out his second term. When Congress refused she was vitriolic in her denunciation of the “fiends” who had blocked her plans with “their infamous and villainous falsehoods.”

“The father of wickedness and lies,” she said, “will get these hoary-headed sinners when they pass away.”

Congress did finally give her twenty-two thousand—approximately the amount that would have been due Lincoln had he served the rest of that year. With this she bought and furnished a marble-front house in Chicago.

Two years elapsed, however, before Lincoln's estate was settled; and, during that time, her expenses mounted and her creditors howled. Presently she had to take in roomers; then boarders; and at last she was obliged to give up her home and move into a boarding-house, herself.

Her exchequer became more and more depleted, until, in September, 1867, she was, as she phrased it, “pressed in a most startling manner for means of subsistence.”

So she packed up a lot of her old clothes and laces and jewelry, and, with her face hidden under a heavy crepe veil, she rushed to New York incognita, registered as a “Mrs. Clark,” met Mrs. Keckley there, gathered up an armful of worn dresses, got into a carriage, drove over to the second-hand clothing dealers on Seventh Avenue, and tried to sell her wardrobe. But the prices offered were disappointingly low.

She next tried the firm of Brady & Keyes, diamond brokers, at 609 Broadway. Listening with amazement to her story, they said:

“Now listen, put your affairs in our hands, and we will raise a hundred thousand dollars for you in a few weeks.”

That sounded rosy; so she wrote, at their request, two or three letters, telling of her dire poverty.

Keyes flaunted these letters in the face of the Republican leaders, threatening to publish them unless he got cash.

But the only thing he got from these men was their opinion of Mrs. Lincoln.

Then she urged Brady & Keyes to mail a hundred and fifty thousand circulars, appealing to the generosity of people everywhere for aid; but it was well-nigh impossible to get prominent men to sign the letter.

Boiling now with wrath at the Republicans, she turned for help to Lincoln's enemies. The New York “World” was a Democratic paper that had once been suspended by government order, and its editor arrested because of its violent attacks on Lincoln. Through its columns Mrs. Lincoln pleaded poverty, admitting that she was trying to sell not only her old clothes, but even such trifles as “a parasol cover” and “two dress patterns.”

It was just before a state election; so the Democratic “World” printed a letter from her, fiercely denouncing such Republicans as Thurlow Weed, William H. Seward, and Henry J. Raymond of the “New York Times.”

With its tongue in its cheek, “The World” solemnly invited its Democratic readers to send in cash contributions to care for the abandoned and suffering widow of the first Republican President. There were few contributions.

Next she tried to get the colored people to raise money for her, urging Mrs. Keckley to throw her heart and soul into the undertaking, and promising that if the Negroes raised twenty-five thousand dollars Mrs. Keckley would get a “cut” of three hundred dollars a year during Mrs. Lincoln's life, and all of the twenty-five thousand dollars at Mrs. Lincoln's death.

Then Brady & Keyes advertised a sale of her clothes and jewelry. Crowds thronged to their store, handling the dresses, criticizing them, declaring that they were out of style, that they were absurdly high-priced, that they were “worn” and “jagged under the arms and at the bottom of the skirts,” and had “stains on the lining.”

Brady & Keyes also opened a subscription-book at their store, hoping that if the sightseers would not buy they might donate money for Mrs. Lincoln.

Finally in despair, the merchants took her clothes and jewels to Providence, Rhode Island, intending to set up an exhibition and charge twenty-five cents admission. The city authorities wouldn't hear of it.

Brady & Keyes did finally sell eight hundred and twenty-four dollars' worth of her effects, but they charged eight hundred and twenty dollars for their services and expenses.

Mrs. Lincoln's campaign to raise money for herself not only failed, it also brought upon her a storm of public condemnation. Throughout the campaign she made a disgraceful exhibition of herself—and so did the public.

She “has dishonored herself, her country and the memory of her late lamented husband,” cried the Albany “Journal.”

She was a liar and a thief—such was the accusation brought against her by Thurlow Weed in a letter to the “Commercial Advertiser.”

For years, back in Illinois, she had been “a terror to the village of Springfield,” her “eccentricities were common talk,” and “the patient Mr. Lincoln was a second Socrates within his own dwelling—” so thundered the “Hartford Evening Press.” But the “Journal” of Springfield stated editorially that for years it had been known that she was deranged, and that she should be pitied for all her strange acts.

“That dreadful woman, Mrs. Lincoln,” complained the Springfield, Massachusetts, “Republican,” “insists on thrusting her repugnant personality before the world to the great mortification of the nation.”

Mortified by these attacks, Mrs. Lincoln poured out her broken heart in a letter to Mrs. Keckley:

Robert came up last evening like a maniac and almost threatening his life, looking like death because the letters of “The World” were published in yesterday's paper.... I weep whilst I am writing. I pray for death this morning. Only my darling Taddie prevents my taking my life.

Estranged now from her sisters and kindred, she finally broke even with Robert, defying and maligning him so bitterly that certain passages of her letters had to be deleted before publication.

When Mrs. Lincoln was forty-nine years old, she wrote the Negro dressmaker: “I feel as if I had not a friend in the world save yourself.”

No other man in United States history has been so respected and loved as Abraham Lincoln; and possibly no other woman in United States history has been so fiercely denounced as his wife.

Less than a month after Mrs. Lincoln had tried to sell her old clothes, Lincoln's estate was settled. It amounted to $110,295, and was divided equally among Mrs. Lincoln and her two sons, each receiving $36,765.

Mrs. Lincoln now took Tad abroad and lived in solitude, reading French novels and avoiding all Americans.

Soon she was pleading poverty again. She petitioned the United States Senate to grant her a yearly pension of five thousand dollars. The bill was greeted in the Senate with hisses from the gallery and words of abuse from the floor.

“It is a sneaking fraud!” cried Senator Howell of Iowa.

“Mrs. Lincoln was not true to her husband!” shouted Senator Yates of Illinois. “She sympathized with the rebellion. She is not worthy of our charity.”

After months of delay and torrents of condemnation she was finally given three thousand a year.

In the summer of 1871 Tad died of typhoid fever, passing away in violent agony. Robert, her only remaining son, was married.

Alone, friendless, and in despair, Mary Lincoln became the prey of obsessions. One day in Jacksonville, Florida, she bought a cup of coffee and then refused to drink it, swearing it was poisoned.

Boarding a train for Chicago, she wired the family physician, imploring him to save Robert's life. But Robert was not ill. He met her at the station and spent a week with her at the Grand Pacific Hotel, hoping to quiet her.

Often in the middle of the night she would rush to his room, declaring that fiends were attempting to murder her, that Indians “were pulling wires out of her brain,” that “doctors were taking steel springs out of her head.”

In the daytime she visited the stores, making absurd purchases, paying, for example, three hundred dollars for lace curtains when she had no home in which to hang them.

With a heavy heart Robert Lincoln applied to the County Court of Chicago, for a trial of his mother's sanity. A jury of twelve men decided that she was insane, and she was confined in a private asylum at Batavia, Illinois.

At the end of thirteen months she was, unfortunately, released— released, but not cured. Then the poor, ailing woman went abroad to live among strangers, refusing to write Robert or let him know her address.

One day while living alone in Pau, France, she mounted a step-ladder to hang a picture above the fireplace; the ladder broke, and she fell, injuring her spinal cord. For a long time, she was unable even to walk.

Returning to her native land to die, she spent her last days at the home of her sister Mrs. Edwards, in Springfield, saying over and over: “You ought to pray now that I be taken to my husband and children.”

Although she then had six thousand dollars in cash and seventy-five thousand in government bonds, nevertheless her mind was constantly racked by absurd fears of poverty, and she was haunted by the fear that Robert, then Secretary of War, would be assassinated like his father.

Longing to escape from the harsh realities that pressed upon her, she shunned every one, closed her doors and windows, pulled down the shades, darkened her room, and lighted a candle even when the sun was shining bright.

“No urging,” says her physician, “would induce her to go out into the fresh air.”

And there, amidst the solitude and soft quiet of the candlelight, her memory doubtless winged its way back across the cruel years, and, dwelling at last among the cherished thoughts of her young womanhood, she imagined herself waltzing once more with Stephen A. Douglas, charmed by his gracious manner and listening to the rich music of his melodious vowels and clear-cut consonants.

At times she imagined that her other sweetheart, a young man named Lincoln—Abraham Lincoln—was coming to court her that night. True, he was only a poor, homely, struggling lawyer who slept in an attic above Speed's store, but she believed he might be President if she could stimulate him to try hard, and, eager to win his love, she longed to make herself beautiful for him. Although she had worn nothing but the deepest black for fifteen years, she would, at such times, slip down to the stores in Springfield; and, according to her physician, she purchased and piled up “large quantities of silks and dress goods in trunks and by the cart load, which she never used and which accumulated until it was really feared that the floor of the store room would give way.”

In 1882, on a peaceful summer evening, the poor, tired, tempestuous soul was given the release for which she had so often prayed. Following a paralytic stroke, she passed quietly away in her sister's house where, forty years before, Abraham Lincoln had put on her finger a ring bearing the words: “Love is eternal.”

In 1876, a gang of counterfeiters tried to steal Lincoln's body. It is an astonishing story, which few books on Lincoln say anything about.

“Big Jim” Kinealy's gang, one of the cleverest counterfeiting crews that ever vexed and perplexed the United States Secret Service, had its headquarters, during the seventies, in the guileless corn-and-hog town of Lincoln, Illinois.

For years Big Jim's suave and mild-mannered “shovers,” as they were called, had been sneaking out across the country and shoving bogus five-dollar bills across the counters of credulous merchants. The profits had been fantastic. But by the spring of 1876, a deadly paralysis was creeping over the gang, for their supply of counterfeit currency was almost exhausted, and Ben Boyd, the master engraver who made their bogus greenbacks, was in prison.

For months Big Jim sniffed vainly about St. Louis and Chicago, trying to get another engraver to make counterfeit bills. Finally he resolved that somehow the invaluable Ben Boyd must be set free.

Big Jim conceived the unholy idea of stealing the body of Abraham Lincoln, and hiding it away. Then, while the whole North was in an uproar, Big Jim would calmly drive a hard and fabulous bargain: he would agree to return the sacred corpse in exchange for Ben Boyd's pardon and a huge pile of gold.

Dangerous? Not at all. For Illinois had upon her statute-book no law against the purloining of bodies.

So in June, 1876, Big Jim set about clearing the decks for action. He despatched five of his conspirators to Springfield, where they opened a saloon and dance-hall, masquerading as bartenders while making their preparations.

Unfortunately for him, one of his “bartenders” drank too much whisky one Saturday night in June, drifted into a redlight house in Springfield, and talked too much. He boasted that he was soon going to have a barrelful of gold.

He whispered the details: on the eve of the next fourth of July, while Springfield was shooting off rockets, he would be out in the Oak Ridge Cemetery, “stealing old Lincoln's bones,” as he put it; and late that night he would bury them in a sandbar under a bridge spanning the Sangamon.

An hour later the parlor-house madam was hurrying to the police, to tell her thrilling news. By morning she had blabbed it to a dozen other men. Soon the whole town had the story, and the masquerading bartenders dropped their towels and fled the city.

But Big Jim was not defeated. He was only delayed. He shifted his headquarters from Springfield to 294 West Madison Street, Chicago. He owned a saloon there. In the front room his man, Terrence Mullen, dispensed liquor to working-men; and in the back he had a sort of club-room, a secret rendezvous for counterfeiters. A bust of Abraham Lincoln stood over the bar.

For months a thief named Lewis G. Swegles had been patronizing this saloon and working himself into the good graces of Big Jim's gang. He admitted that he had served two terms in the penitentiary for stealing horses, and boasted that he was now “the boss body-snatcher of Chicago.” He declared he supplied the medical schools of the town with most of their cadavers. That sounded plausible enough then, for grave-robbing was a national horror; medical colleges, in order to obtain bodies for dissection in their class rooms, were forced to buy them from ghouls who sneaked up to the rear door at two o'clock in the morning, with caps pulled low over their eyes and bulging sacks slung across their backs.

Swegles and Kinealy's gang perfected the details of their plan for rifling Lincoln's tomb. They would stuff the body into a long sack, pitch it into the bottom of a spring-wagon, and, with relays of fresh horses, would drive with all possible speed to northern Indiana; and there with only the water-fowl to see them, they would hide the body among the lonely dunes, where the wind from over the lake would soon wipe out all telltale tracks in the shifting sands.

Before leaving Chicago, Swegles bought a London newspaper; and, tearing out a piece, he stuffed the rest inside the bust of Lincoln that stood over the bar at 294 West Madison Street. That night, November 6, he and two of Big Jim's gang climbed aboard a Chicago & Alton train headed for Springfield, taking with them the fragment of torn newspaper, which they proposed to leave beside the empty sarcophagus as they dashed off with the body. The detectives finding the paper would naturally keep it as a clue. Then while the nation was rocking with excitement, one of the gang would approach the governor of the State and offer to return Lincoln's body for two hundred thousand dollars in gold and the freedom of Ben Boyd.

And how would the governor know that the self-styled spokesman was not an impostor? The gangster would carry with him the London newspaper; the detectives, fitting their fragment into the torn page, would accept him as the bona-fide representative of the ghouls.

The gang arrived in Springfield, according to schedule. They had chosen what Swegles called “a damned elegant time” for their adventure. November 7 was election day; for months the Democrats had been denouncing the Republicans for the graft and corruption that had besmirched Grant's second administration, while the Republicans had waved the “bloody shirt” of the Civil War in the face of the Democrats. It was one of the most bitter elections in United States history. That night, while excited crowds were milling about the newspaper offices and jamming the saloons, Big Jim's men hurried out to Oak Ridge Cemetery—dark now, and deserted—sawed the padlock off the iron door of Lincoln's tomb, stepped inside, pried the marble lid off the sarcophagus, and lifted the wooden casket half out.

One of the gang ordered Swegles to bring up the horses and spring-wagon which he had been delegated to have ready and waiting in a ravine two hundred yards northeast of the monument. Swegles hurried down the steep bluff until he was lost in the darkness.

Swegles was not a grave-robber. He was a reformed criminal now employed as a stool-pigeon by the Secret Service. He had no team and wagon waiting in the ravine; but he did have eight detectives waiting for him in the memorial room of the tomb. So he raced around there and gave them the signal they had all agreed upon: he struck a match, lighted a cigar, and whispered the password “Wash.”

The eight Secret Service men, in their stocking-feet, rushed out of their hiding-place, every man with a cocked revolver in each hand. They dashed around the monument with Swegles, stepped into the dark tomb, and ordered the ghouls to surrender.

There was no answer. Tyrrell, the district chief of the Secret Service, lighted a match. There lay the coffin, half out of the sarcophagus. But where were the thieves? The detectives searched the cemetery in all directions. The moon was coming up over the tree-tops. As Tyrrell rushed up onto the terrace of the monument, he could make out the forms of two men, staring at him from behind a group of statuary. In the excitement and confusion, he began firing at them with both pistols, and in an instant they were firing back. But they weren't the thieves. He was shooting at his own men.

In the meantime, the thieves, who had been waiting a hundred feet away in the darkness, for Swegles to return with the horses, dashed off through the woods.

Ten days later they were caught in Chicago, brought to Springfield, thrown into a jail, and surrounded by heavy guards day and night. For a time there was intense public excitement and indignation. Lincoln's son Robert, who had married into the wealthy Pullman family, employed the best lawyers in Chicago to prosecute the gang. They did what they could, but they had a hard time. There was no law in Illinois, then, against stealing a body. If the thieves had actually stolen the coffin, they might have been prosecuted for that, but they hadn't stolen it; they had not taken it out of the tomb. So the best the highpriced attorneys from Chicago could do was to prosecute the ghouls for having conspired to steal a coffin worth seventy-five dollars, the maximum penalty for which offense was five years. But the case did not come to trial for eight months; public indignation had died down by that time, and politics were at work; and, on the first ballot, four jurors actually voted for acquittal. After a few more ballots the twelve men compromised and sent the ghouls to the Joliet prison fox one year.

Since Lincoln's friends were afraid that other thieves might steal the body, the Lincoln Monument Association hid it away for two years in an iron coffin under a heap of loose boards lying in a damp, dark passageway behind the catacombs—a sort of cellar. During that time thousands of pilgrims paid their respects to an empty sarcophagus.

For various reasons Lincoln's remains have been moved seventeen times. But they will be moved no more. The coffin is now imbedded in a great ball of steel and solid concrete, six feet beneath the floor of the tomb. It was placed there on September 26, 1901.

On that day the casket was opened, and human eyes gazed down for the last time upon his face. Those who saw him then remarked how natural he appeared. He had been dead thirty-six years; but the embalmers had done their work well, and he still looked very much as he had looked in life. His face was a trifle darker, and there was a touch of mold on one wing of his black tie.
