THE RADIUM WOMAN







作者序


居里夫人的女儿曾为母亲的一生作传，文字生动流畅、言情并茂，其造诣难以超越。因此，本人秉持谦虚谨慎的态度，在《居里夫人传》的基础上，为青年读者编写了这本篇幅较短的书。

年过二八，再去了解人类历史上那些杰出非凡、坚毅热忱的伟人并聆听他们崇高光辉的事迹，就已为时太晚。然而，人物的生平传记却免不了要鸿篇巨制，且遣词用句也大多仅为那些阅历丰富的读者所熟知。

因而，我希望这本《居里夫人的故事》能让青年读者从居里夫人生平事迹中获得和长者们同样多的激励与鼓舞，并能让他们发出这样的感慨：“这位杰出女性的一言一行、一点一滴，都不容错过！还要再找来艾芙·居里写的《居里夫人传》好好品读一番。”

第一章　玛妮雅唱歌


怎么不行？如何不行？到底为什么不行？为什么不让玛妮雅读书？她最终还是把问题埋在了心里。她不愿意去问自己温柔美丽的母亲；她只会撑着自己倔强的小脑袋，百思不得其解，一缕金发后那双明亮的灰蓝色眼睛透出锐利的目光。

总是这样！她自顾自地说：“我就不能读书吗？”一摸书，就肯定有人会说，“玛妮雅乖孩子，快去花园里玩玩吧”。或者“你可是一整天都没玩布娃娃了呢”。又或者“快用那些漂亮的新积木搭幢房子吧”。玛妮雅对他们这些小把戏早已了如指掌。她要是读书那就是淘气——但这只针对她一人而言，要换作是布朗尼娅那就完全不同了；然而事实上，布朗尼娅根本看不懂书，只有玛妮雅才能读懂。不过，她但凡从布朗尼娅手里抢来本书，那就是大错特错，尽管她并没有任何恶意，这可真让人摸不着头脑。有时候她们待在叔叔的果园里无事可做，布朗尼娅就会叫她一起玩字母卡片，于是两个人就躺在草地上，摆弄着卡片将字母拼成单词。从叔叔家回来后的某一天，爸爸问起了功课，对布朗尼娅说：“来看看你最近读书有没有长进。”布朗尼娅摊开书，开始拼单词，但却读得结结巴巴、磕磕绊绊。玛妮雅一把夺过书来放声朗读。“玛妮雅！”妈妈厉声喊道，又急又气，而爸爸则是一脸严肃，布朗尼娅也气鼓鼓的。玛妮雅别无选择，只能啜泣道：“对不起……玛妮雅不是故意的。”

自从那天起，家里就彻底不让玛妮雅读书了，她站在妈妈的房间门前不知所措。布朗尼娅与约瑟夫和海拉一起玩堡垒对峙的游戏，于是整个早上玛妮雅都要不停地穿过长长的走廊给布朗尼娅运送“军备物资”。堡垒是用新积木块堆成的，这运送的“物资”中自然也包括积木块了，不一会儿玛妮雅就又热又累，游戏也就暂告一段落。休息时，玛妮雅看到了姐姐便跑去花园里。“若莎！若莎！”她边跑边叫道，然后两个人手牵着手一同走。若莎已经十二岁了，在他们四个小屁孩儿的眼里那就是大人了，四个孩子中约瑟夫、海拉、布朗尼娅已经年满八岁，而玛妮雅当时只有五岁，不过她四岁便开始读书识字了。正是因此才不让她读书，斯克沃多夫斯基夫妇不想让他们天资聪颖的小女儿过早承受压力，但夫妻俩却没想着要给玛妮雅解释这个原因。

花园又大又平整，四周围墙环绕，草坪被踩得有些破败，但周围树木茂盛。花园里大部分地方都能让孩子们玩得尽兴，唯独出入花园时他们却要特别当心，因为要经过“怪人”叔叔家的窗户，这个花园坐落在男子中学里，斯克沃多夫斯基一家和怪人叔叔都住在学校里。即便是若莎，在经过怪人叔叔家的窗口时都是小心翼翼，放低声音悄悄告诉小妹妹要保持安静。

尽管只有五岁，但玛妮雅懂得的事情可不少。她知道奥格尔是个怪人，因为有一群人将她的祖国一分为三并且出卖给外人，就像巨人与两个同类瓜分战利品一样，而奥格尔就是这群人中的一员。玛妮雅是波兰人，奥格尔是俄国人，是一所学校的校长，玛妮雅的爸爸就是那所学校的数学和物理老师。奥格尔要求学校里所有的波兰人，不分男女，举手投足都必须表现得和俄国人一样。玛妮雅知道和这样的人在一起必须时刻保持警惕、小心翼翼，不要被抓住把柄。

玛妮雅知道的还不止这些：尽管她生活在城市里，但她清楚地知道乡下是个景色秀丽、充满欢乐的地方。在乡下，人来人往、热闹非凡，有自己的叔叔婶婶、堂兄弟姐妹；在乡下，可以在溪流里划船涉水，可以捏泥巴然后在太阳光下烤干做成“美味的泥巴蛋糕”。乡下还有一株古老的椴树，他们七个堂兄弟姐妹可以坐在上面，尽情地嚼着从清爽绿叶下摘下的醋栗果。玛妮雅一来，他们便将她举上弯弯曲曲的树枝上乘凉，给她摘果子吃。七月里玛妮雅简直就是个玩疯了的小农夫。

她还很了解自己的妈妈。她知道妈妈爱她远胜一切。妈妈温柔美丽、歌声动人，玛妮雅对此深信不疑。每晚睡前，妈妈都会抚摸玛妮雅的秀发和额头，虽然不是亲吻脸庞，但玛妮雅很喜欢这种特殊的亲密方式。晚上，全家人都会围跪在圆桌旁祷告“保佑妈妈快点好起来”，玛妮雅却从未想过这样做是因为妈妈生病了，也没联想到这就是妈妈不能亲吻她的原因。

玛妮雅出生于1867年11月7日，取名玛丽雅，不过大家都唤她玛妮雅或玛妮莎，或者更亲昵地称呼她一个特别的小名安丘佩秋，因为波兰人特别喜欢昵称。若莎有时候会坐在花园里给玛妮雅讲个关于安丘佩秋的长长的故事，若莎讲故事讲得比别人都好，还会经常编一些有趣的小短剧，自编自演给弟弟妹妹看，她一个人扮演所有角色。若莎演得惟妙惟肖，看得玛妮雅时而哈哈大笑，时而胆战心惊，都搞不清自己到底生活在哪个国家，周围的邻居是什么样的人，故事里的人物又是谁。

回到家，她们看见爸爸已经下了课，正坐在书房里，书房是家里面积最大且欢乐最多的地方。两个人轻手轻脚地走进书房，看见妈妈正坐在那里给玛妮雅缝鞋，剪刀咔嚓咔嚓作响，裁过硬硬的皮革。蜡线刺啦刺啦在皮革层间穿梭、拉紧，小锤头叮当叮当地敲在按扣上。斯克沃多夫斯卡夫人白皙纤瘦的双手灵巧敏捷，即便是做这样费劲儿的活儿也游刃有余——不过她也必须这样，因为五个孩子一年就能穿坏好多双皮鞋。

爸爸整晚都在谈论奥格尔，平常也经常会提起他。奥格尔对这个家庭影响很深，而且以后还会更深。奥格尔最近严厉地批评了一个波兰男孩，就因为他犯了一个俄语语法错误，但俄语可是世界上最难学的语言之一。斯克沃多夫斯基先生又没忍住，替学生解围道：“奥格尔先生，尽管您是土生土长的俄国人，但您也会犯语法错误呀。”奥格尔没有立刻反驳。他皱着眉，瞪着眼，但最终还是忍住了怒火，准备留着以后一起算账。

玛妮雅在爸爸的书房里踱来踱去，挺着自己笔直的小鼻子，沉浸在自己的想法里，小心翼翼地摆弄着喜欢的小玩意儿，怕吵到哥哥姐姐，他们都在爸爸那张平整的大书桌上做作业呢。玛妮雅对挂在墙上的那幅精美的主教画像丝毫提不起兴趣；据说这幅画出自名家之手，但并不对玛妮雅的胃口。她喜欢桌子上那座钟表，能一直聚精会神地盯着表面，听着响亮的嘀嗒声。她的手指在色彩明丽的西西里桌子那光滑的大理石板上有节奏地划来划去；她也喜欢这张桌子，但不喜欢它上面的诸如蓝色塞勒夫杯子之类的东西。她格外留心地从一旁走过，以免碰到这个易碎的物件。而其他的宝贝就没有这么娇气；它们更结实也更神秘，有又长又难懂的可爱名字——这挂在墙上的气压计，爸爸每天都会在孩子们的注视下认真检查；玻璃橱柜里还摆着精致的天平、矿物质和金箔验电器。“那些……？”玛妮雅有天问道。

“那些是什么？”爸爸用一本正经却又略加调侃的语气打断了玛妮雅，“那些是物理仪器。”

爸爸并没有想到！玛妮雅自己也从没想过，日后她与物理仪器之间会结下怎样的不解之缘，但她当时确实喜欢上了这个发音独特的名词，边跑边唱道：

“物——理——仪——器，物——理——仪——器……”





第二章　玛妮雅学习


玛妮雅上的学校可真是个怪地方，她在那里学些不寻常的事。比如，如何打破禁条，做不允许做的事；如何快速掩饰自己不守纪律的小动作；如何假装在做自己并没做的事；如何蒙骗政府巡查员。因为玛妮雅比一般小孩都聪明，所以她很快就比别人做得都好。但学校里最奇怪的就是，无论班主任还是女校长都觉得玛妮雅是个温顺乖巧的好孩子，而不是个问题学生。

一天，班里二十五名学生都在如饥似渴地听着历史课——历史课比英语课生动多了，因为这是一堂禁课。班里的二十五名学生和老师都知道这是违反纪律的。

孩子们端坐在教室，年龄大多十二岁左右。玛妮雅只有十岁，坐在第三排靠近窗户的位置，透过高高的窗户她能看到外面白雪皑皑的草地。班里所有孩子都身穿海军蓝的校服、系着钢扣、翻着白领子，头发编成整齐的辫子别在耳后，挺着笔直的腰杆。她们全都竖着耳朵，左耳朵费力地听着历史课上的每一个字，右耳朵警惕地准备捕捉随时可能响起的门铃叮当声——她们全部都参与了违禁活动！老师和学生们随时都可能被抓住！

玛妮雅正在回答问题——老师很喜欢叫她回答问题，因为她历史成绩总是名列前茅，在算术、文学、德语和法语课上也是数一数二。这会儿，她正在复述她学到的关于波兰国王斯坦尼斯拉斯·奥古斯特的相关内容。

她说：“1764年，奥古斯特当选为波兰国王。他是一位睿智聪颖、文化造诣极高的国王，与诗人和艺术家为友。他深知波兰弱小的原因，努力让国家走向富强，但遗憾的是他缺乏勇气……”即便是玛妮雅这样的小姑娘也知道国王必须勇敢有魄力，因而她的语气满是惋惜，这是一个早谙世事的十岁孩子发出的沉重叹惜。当——当——丁，丁。所有人立马吓得一个激灵。大家快速行动，并且绝对安静。女教师杜佩莎收起波兰课本，所有的学生也都摞好他们的练习册和波兰历史书。五名值日生用围裙收好所有人的书，一个箭步冲到住校生的宿舍里放好。其余人拿出针线包，在棉布上缝着精美的纽扣，就好像从未做过其他事。

俄国巡查员走进来，旁边跟着女校长，她因为没能挡住巡查员快速的脚步而面色沉郁，并且有些惊慌失措，担心那两声长两声短的警铃没能给孩子们足够的时间来掩饰违禁行为。但事实上，孩子们并没露出任何马脚，好似一直在专心做针线活，别的什么也没有，唯一可疑的一点就是那五名值日生小姑娘热得两颊红扑扑的，气喘吁吁。不过男巡查员根本察觉不到这一点。

巡查员霍恩贝格先生一屁股重重地坐在椅子上。他脑袋胖乎乎的，且剃了光头，但长得还算顺眼。他身上的制服也为他平添了几分帅气，他身穿黄色裤子，合身的蓝色皮夹克上扣着锃亮的银色金属扣。在一片寂静中，他透过金丝边眼镜眼神凌厉地扫视着每一名学生，并且快速瞥了一眼杜佩莎老师摊开在桌上的书。

“学生们做手工的时候你还大声读书吗？”他审问道，“是什么书？”

“《克雷洛夫的寓言》。我们今天刚开始学。”

霍恩贝格先生熟知这本俄语书，并且打心眼里认可。他随意打开一张课桌，发现里面净无一物。孩子们停下手中的活儿，礼貌性地等着巡查员训话。而他却一点儿也看不出孩子们那一张张平静的笑脸背后隐藏的恐惧和机灵，以及庄重严肃的眼神背后透露出的愤恨。

“女士，请点一名学生起立。”

杜佩莎如释重负，她肯定会挑一名绝不会惹出麻烦的学生。然而，这名学生也在默默祈祷千万不要被点到，“老天爷，求求你，千万别是我……”她却没听到上天说，“玛妮雅·斯克沃多夫斯卡，全世界都在等着你学会去做那些令人不悦的事。”她确实听到杜佩莎老师叫到了玛妮雅·斯克沃多夫斯卡！

她站起来，脸上红一阵、白一阵，羞愧感如鲠在喉。

“背诵主祷文。”霍恩贝格命令道。

玛妮雅听从吩咐，按照这个俄国巡查员的命令，用俄语而不是按照自己的民族习惯采用拉丁语，开始背诵。

“说出继叶卡捷琳娜二世之后，伟大俄国沙皇的名字。”

“叶卡捷琳娜二世，保罗一世，亚历山大一世，尼古拉一世，亚历山大二世。”玛妮雅用标准的俄语背诵道，就好像自己是土生土长的圣彼得堡人。

“还有沙皇家族成员的名字和头衔。”

“皇后陛下，皇太子亚历山大殿下，大公殿下……”

“很好！谁统治我们？”

玛妮雅犹豫了。

“谁统治我们？”巡查员重复道，有些恼怒。

“俄国沙皇陛下亚历山大二世。”玛妮雅吞吞吐吐道，脸色苍白。

讯问结束，巡查员走了，对他所见所闻甚是满意，感觉对自己的部门领导得十分成功。但玛妮雅却因此崩溃大哭，痛苦得仿若心碎。

放学了，走在外面的大街上，孩子们兴奋地向前来接她们的妈妈和保姆阿姨们讲述一天发生的事情；但一定都是低声耳语，因为他们清楚地知道，任何一个路人、闲逛的人都可能是间谍，甚至会将一个孩童说的话向政府报告。

海拉和玛妮雅一边一个牵着露西娅阿姨的手。“巡查员考问玛妮雅了，”海拉悄悄说道，“她对答如流，但事后又哭得像个孩子。不管怎样，巡查员什么刺儿也没挑到。”

玛妮雅绝口不提。她厌恶这一切——厌恶自己的恐惧，厌恶自己属于一个被奴役的国家，厌恶自己不得不撒谎，一直在撒谎。她紧抓着阿姨的胳膊，记起了自己厌恶的一切，首先是想尽办法让爸爸不能再教书的奥格尔。这件事迫使他们不得不接受学生借宿在自己家里。学生们调皮、令人讨厌，常常让家里人觉得不自在。但比起没有若莎陪伴，没有若莎给她讲故事，听她倾诉衷肠，这点不愉快根本不算什么。若莎不幸被家里借宿的一个学生传染上了伤寒症，永远离开了人世。

阳光和煦，三个人穿过白雪覆盖的公园向华沙老城走去。老城里街道狭窄，两边建筑物高斜的屋顶上环绕着一圈白雪。不时地探出奇形怪状的小雕塑，是圣女的脸庞或奇特的石兽。

突然，头顶上方传来古老教堂的钟声，在这冷冻结霜的空气中显得清脆而洪亮。这附近有很多类似的教堂，露西娅阿姨引着孩子们穿过其中一座黑漆漆的大门，多年前他们常来这里做礼拜。没有了若莎，玛妮雅现在怎么走进去？但她还是进去了，因为她现在心里比任何时候都感到冰冷和害怕，也想祈求上帝能让母亲身体渐好。“让妈妈好起来吧，”她祈祷道，“就让我替母亲去死吧，求求你，上帝。”

在冬季凛冽的寒风中，露西娅阿姨提出：她们要去维斯瓦河，从运输船上买些苹果。忘掉了忧伤，孩子们蹦蹦跳跳地走下长长的石阶，朝河边走去。伟大的维斯瓦河翻滚着沉郁的黄色巨流，绕过低平的沙洲，长长的、空荡荡的驳船缓缓地停靠在一起，有时因为撞到浮槽和岸边的洗衣房而发出沉重的砰砰声。只有在两只长长的、载满苹果的驳船边才显露出这冬季里的一丝生气，它们从河上游的远方而来，为华沙城的孩子们带来了红润明媚的欢乐。船主惬意地裹着羊皮袄，来回摆弄着货物，抱起货物上盖着的稻草，向客人们展示：尽管驳船在维斯瓦河上一行数日，但船上的苹果还是红彤彤有光泽，丝毫没有被霜冻坏。

先是海拉，而后是玛妮雅，她们脱掉了暖手筒，放下书包，兴奋地挑拣起苹果，整齐地码在大柳条筐里，将好不容易找到的坏苹果扔进河里，比比谁投得远。

露西娅阿姨找了个男孩将篮子提回家，并从船上把两个孩子赶下岸，那会儿她们俩还在大口大口地啃着红润的苹果。

她们五点钟才到家，用过家里的可口晚餐后就坐在大桌子旁开始写作业。很快在这些愤怒的小孩子中间便爆发出了喧杂的读书声，他们声音很大，这在波兰以外的国家肯定是种不礼貌的行为。孩子们要用俄语学习。而用俄语学数学对波兰孩子们来说更是难上加难。学法语和德语语法也是用俄语，有不认识的单词就查俄语字典。当然他们可以用波兰语描述难点，但第二天一上学就要用俄语，而且还要用俄语复习几何课。他们要用外语写作，并且直接用俄语来学习法文。学习真是件困难的事。

但玛妮雅可是个小小魔术师。她好像有魔力似的，不用刻意去学，就能知道很多事；俄语诗只要读两遍，就能毫无差错地完全掌握，小幸运星！她也是个好心肠的幸运儿，有时提前做完作业，她就会帮别人解决难题。当然这只是偶尔。如果有机会，她就会两肘支在桌上，中间放上一本书，双手捂着耳朵不去听海拉的背诵，只是专心阅读。玛妮雅读书的时候全神贯注，什么都无法打搅；她什么也听不见。全家人有时可能特意开玩笑，敲打着罐子，制造出像在动物园里一样的声响，而玛妮雅如果是在看书就什么都听不见。这就是聚精会神，上天赐予她的美妙礼物。

有一次玛妮雅看书时，其他人在她周围用椅子搭起了一个架子，左右各放一把椅子，后面一把，上面一把，头顶上方又搭了三把。她不仅听不到搭椅子的声音，连椅子或者搭建者的影子也看不到，更听不到别人兴奋的窃窃私语或捂嘴发出的咯咯笑声。玛妮雅看完书抬起头，“椅子大厦”轰然倒塌，躲在一旁的人群立即爆发出洪亮的笑声。这让玛妮雅有些不悦。她揉了揉青肿的肩膀，走进另一间房，顺便瞥了一眼哥哥姐姐们，说道：“真幼稚！”

晚上睡觉前，斯克沃多夫斯基家的女孩们在餐厅里打地铺，卧室让给了付费借宿的学生。睡到半夜，皮毯经常滑落，把人冻得瑟瑟发抖。而且他们早晨天不亮就要起床，把餐厅腾出来，再为学生们准备早餐。

但这些对于玛妮雅来说都不重要。她妈妈病得越来越重，就连她也看得出来。她经常向上帝祷告，但上帝好像并没有听到这个十岁小女孩的声音。春天，将近五月份时，玛妮雅还不满十一岁，妈妈就去世了，并在临终前对女儿说道：“妈妈爱你。”

玛妮雅自此学会了很多；认识到面对生活，不仅仅是一个国家的君王需要勇气，整个国家、成年人和孩子们都需要充满勇气。她对这一切也有了自己独到的看法。生活对她来说既残忍又不公平，更是无法完全理解的。她固执、愤怒，且绝不顺服。





第三章　反叛


十四岁的玛妮雅出落得还没有姐姐们漂亮。布朗尼娅已经日渐成熟，穿着拖地长裙，金黄的头发在脑后束成发髻。她接任了母亲在家的角色，照看家务和寄宿学生。海拉已经十六岁，出落成了一个美人，白皙高挑、光彩照人。约瑟夫也长得高大帅气，他已经上了大学，在学习医药专业。

女孩们也憧憬着自己有朝一日能上大学，但在俄国统治下的波兰，女人是不能上大学的。如果她们想在中学的基础上再有所深造，便只能从书本中获得，或者去其他国家学习。

此时，玛妮雅对自己还比较满意。她上到了高中，就像小松鼠捡到了坚果一样快乐；但她有点儿担心布朗尼娅。上不了大学，布朗尼娅该怎么办？玛妮雅能不能想个办法把布朗尼娅送到某个国家，在那里女孩能学习她们想了解到的一切？她下定决心，要努力工作赚钱供养姐姐。然而，赚钱最快的方法就是顺利毕业！一天早晨，玛妮雅如果不快点吃完早饭，上学就会迟到，她切好午餐吃的三明治，最后正准备切做三明治用的羊肉时，朗斯特一个箭步跑来抢肉吃，这打断了玛妮雅的思绪，但她救出了——是的，她从朗斯特嘴里救出了羊肉。朗斯特是一条赤毛猎犬，是全家人的宠儿。它十分漂亮，淘气地做尽了一切不该做的事。它的耳朵、尾巴和四肢上长着金毛，本应做一条温顺的猎狗，但却丝毫未被驯化。玛妮雅还有兄弟姐妹们都十分宠溺它，经常亲吻它，把它宠得像条哈巴狗。它在椅子上呼呼大睡，尾巴一扫打碎了花瓶；偷吃别人的午餐；对来客张牙舞爪、惹人心烦，悄无声息地叼走客人的帽子和手套——等再找回来时，那帽子和手套几乎都戴不成了。

玛妮雅终于安全地包好午餐，把书包往背后一背，叫朗斯特乖乖待在家后，便连忙往学校跑去。

经过扎莫伊斯基伯爵住过的蓝色宫殿时，玛妮雅停下脚步，在一座守护着古老石头庭院的大青铜狮子前驻足，用手将狮子嘴上挂着的重铜环推到鼻子上。

“玛妮莎，先别走，”窗边传来一个声音，“卡西娅马上就来。”玛妮雅经常来接卡西娅一起上学，那是伯爵图书管理员的女儿；如果卡西娅来晚了，她就会把青铜环推上去，然后先走。这样卡西娅就能知道她是不是先走了。

“今天下午来喝茶，”卡西娅的妈妈说道，“还有你们最喜欢的冰可可。”

“你一定要来喝茶哦，”卡西娅说道，“哦！我们是不是要迟到了？快走吧！”

于是，两个人沿着狭窄的街道一路狂奔，穿过公园，但都没能像路人一样观察到彼此之间的差别。卡西娅穿着精致得体，一看就是父母特别宠爱的小公主，而相比之下玛妮雅穿得就有些寒酸了。

上学的路很长，她们有足够的时间闲聊，也有足够的时间玩点儿小游戏。在多雨的日子里，两个人穿着胶鞋踩过水洼最深处，拖出一道长长的水印；天气晴朗的时候，她们就玩“绿色”游戏。

“咱们去商店买个新练习本吧，”玛妮雅说道，“我之前见到一些特别漂亮的练习本，绿色封皮的那种……”

但卡西娅并未上当。还没等玛妮雅把话说完，她一听到“绿色”这两个字就从兜里摸出早就准备好的一块绿色天鹅绒递给玛妮雅。卡西娅成功避开了惩罚，不过游戏没有继续下去。玛妮雅好像并不想玩游戏。她讲起了上次的历史课，课堂上老师一反常态地告诉学生波兰只是俄国的一个省，波兰语也只是一种方言。

“不过老师看上去有些不自在，”玛妮雅评论道，“你难道没注意到老师根本就不敢直视咱们，而且面色有些苍白吗？”

“没错！”卡西娅说道，“他几乎都脸色发绿了。”不消一瞬间，她就看见玛妮雅在她眼皮子底下捻动着嫩绿的栗子叶。

“我们都走过纪念碑了！”玛妮雅惊慌地叫道，“哎哟，天啊！我们得赶快往回走！”她们回过头时刚好就在萨克斯广场，看见四只石狮子上立着一根高柱子。柱子上面写着“献给忠君爱主的波兰人”。沙皇让人立起柱子，警示那些背叛国家的波兰人，他们为支持压迫者而奋斗至死。每次经过纪念碑，忠心爱国的波兰人都会向石碑吐唾沫，这已经成为他们的职责。玛妮雅和卡西娅每次都会尽心履职，哪怕是走路折返或是上学迟到。

“你今晚要来看跳舞吗？”玛妮雅问道。卡西娅当然会去。每周都会有几家人来斯克沃多夫斯基家里聚会跳舞；不过只有长大成人的女孩们才能跳舞。卡西娅和玛妮雅只能静静地坐在一旁看。然而，她们光是看也能学会一些技巧，研究舞步，探讨移动姿势，熟悉曲调；等大人们跳完舞，她俩就开始自己练习。

她们穿过学校里的拱门走进庭院，边走边热切地聊着“长大成人”的趣事。女孩们从四面八方拥进庭院。她们一个挨着一个走到空地上，走进三层楼的建筑里；人群中充满了欢声笑语和兴高采烈的寒暄问候。但其中有一个女孩，独自一人行色匆匆，尽量避免惹人注意。玛妮雅和卡西娅迎面走向她，发现她双眼红肿，而且衣衫不整，好像匆忙穿上来不及收拾一样。

“库妮卡是怎么了？”她们互相问道，其中一人用胳膊搂住了她。

“库妮卡，你怎么啦？”

库妮卡几乎说不出话，她苍白的脸上满是痛苦。“我哥哥出事了，”她断断续续地说道，“他被秘密逮捕了……已经整整三天了，我们没有他任何消息……他们……他们明天黎明时分就要把他绞死。”

这些话听完只会让人觉得大脑一片空白。两个人将库妮卡从人群中搀到一边；俯下身来，试图仔细理解她说的话，努力安慰她。但对于哥哥明天就要被绞死的人来说，任何安慰都无济于事！玛妮雅和卡西娅认识那个年轻活泼的男孩。他是她们的朋友。他什么也没做错。可他怎么就要死了呢？

“快回去上课，同学们！也聊够了吧！”耳边传来德国督学迈尔小姐那恶狠狠的声音，三人不得不掩藏起痛苦，回去上课。

这已经不再是玛妮雅孩童时期上学的那所私立学校了，如今变成了俄国政府统治下的公立学校。在这所学校里，除了学生，一切都是俄国的。波兰学生只能上这所学校，他们别无选择，因为只有这样才能获得一纸文凭、找到工作。他们还在上学，所以能比大人们更加反叛，并且可以更加自由地表达思想。玛妮雅和卡西娅喜欢编俏皮话来打趣她们的俄国老师、德国校长，尤其是迈尔小姐，并以此为乐。迈尔小姐讨厌玛妮雅，而玛妮雅对她的厌恶更是有过之而无不及。

小个子、黑皮肤的迈尔小姐，为了不让人发觉，总是穿着软底鞋到处走，以便更好地监视女孩们。

“没必要再和那个叫斯克沃多夫斯卡的女孩废什么话，”她说，“跟她讲话就是用青豆砸墙，丝毫不起作用！”

“看看你那愚蠢可笑、任性妄为、曲曲拳拳的头发，玛妮雅·斯克沃多夫斯卡！你多长时间梳一次头？过来，我给你梳梳，最起码让你看上去像个大方得体的女学生。”“那才像德国版的玛格丽特呢！”玛妮雅在心里嘀咕道，但她嘴上什么也没说。于是，迈尔小姐拿着那把不知梳过多少人头发的梳子，蛮横生硬地梳着玛妮雅的头。不过无论她怎么用力，那些鬈发就像和她作对一般——那一头光亮精致且固执任性的鬈发仍旧原模原样地勾勒着玛妮雅那张叛逆的小圆脸。

“别用那样的眼神盯着我！”迈尔小姐吼道，“你没有权力低头轻视我！”

“我也无能为力。”玛妮雅如实说道，她比迈尔小姐高出整整一个头。有些话能够一语双关，这无疑让玛妮雅一阵窃喜。

不过，学校里的某些老师还是受人爱戴的，他们中有一些是波兰人。而在一些俄国老师身上，学生们也惊讶地发现存在着对波兰的同情之心。于是他们开始慢慢理解，即使在俄国，也存在反叛之人。一位俄国老师竟然将一本革命诗集作为奖励赠予学生。这一无声举动迅速成为校园里热议的话题，学生们也充满好奇与敬仰地打量起这位老师。波兰人与俄国人可以和平共处。是的，没错！学校里的学生本不就是有俄国人、波兰人、德国人、犹太人吗？在学校他们丝毫感觉不到种族的区分。而在校外，各国人彼此之间保持距离，以防间谍。

尽管这样，玛妮雅还是热爱自己的学校；带着一丝羞愧，她坦白了这一切。“卡西娅，你知道吗？”她有次放假写信时写道，“我喜欢学校。你会因此嘲笑我吗？我喜欢学校，甚至非常喜欢。我虽然没有极度渴望上学，肯定没有！但我也不会因为一个又一个的学期而苦恼，更不会因为还要上很多年学而感到害怕。”

但就在那一天，当迈尔小姐将学生们从庭院里叫回来时，玛妮雅却根本无心上学。在这个阳光明媚的早晨，她满脑子本来想的都是音乐、跳舞和玩乐。但忽然之间，世界天翻地覆。课堂上晦涩的内容全都左耳朵进右耳朵出，她什么也看不到，眼前只浮现出自己认识的那个热血少年……以及带有绞刑架的寒冷黎明。

当晚，斯克沃多夫斯基一家根本无心跳舞。玛妮雅、布朗尼娅、海拉、卡西娅和她姐姐乌拉都陪着库妮卡通宵坐到天明，守望着漫漫长夜，心念着那个即将失去生命的男孩。守夜是天主教的习俗，让人保持清醒以便思考。六个孩子包括库妮卡在内围坐在一起。我们旁观者根本无法体会她们当时的所思所感。这与亲人的自然死亡截然不同，即便是孩童也能领会自然死亡；但这种——只能坐等时间的静静流逝，等待昭显人类残酷冷漠的时刻步步逼近，等待人类用不义的行为污染黎明——的确令人毛骨悚然。这场守夜一定是沉默寂静的，因为无言可诉、无事可为，唯有思绪万千，唯有六颗年轻反叛的心所拥有的反抗思想。她们时不时竭尽所能地安慰库妮卡，也因为同情而心如刀绞。她们试图劝慰库妮卡喝些热水；轻柔地搂着她或帮她擦干泪水。忽然间，她们觉察到有烛火之外的亮光射进房间。天际绯红。红色的黎明已经到来。六人将充满恐惧的面庞深深埋藏在臂弯中，跪卧在地上，为那个逝去的男孩祈祷。





第四章　整整一年的假期


玛妮雅十六岁了。授予金质奖章的日子悄然来临，玛妮雅是家中第三个拿到金质奖章的孩子。颁奖的日子在六月份，正当炎炎酷暑。玛妮雅同其他获奖人一样，身穿黑裙，腰带上别着一束蔷薇花。周围熙熙攘攘的人们向她握手道贺。这一切的结束也就意味着玛妮雅永远告别了高中生活，她挽着自豪的父亲，手指紧紧地握着父亲的胳膊。

父亲亲口许诺要给她放整整一年的假。这的确是一份大礼，整整一年的毕业假！玛妮雅不知道为什么自己可以放这么久的假，但父亲认为玛妮雅一直以来十分勤奋，而且比同龄的其他女孩都早毕业，她可以尽情享受自己的努力成果，悠闲等待同龄人追赶上她的进度。于是玛妮雅一下子从一个勤奋上进的小姑娘变成了“小懒虫”，开始尽情享受这其中的乐趣。

“亲爱的小伙伴，”她在给卡西娅的信中写道，“我已然不知这世上竟然还有代数和几何这样的东西。我早把它们一股脑儿抛在脑后了。我甚至连手工也不做了。我什么都不做。我早上十点钟起床，有时六点，什么也不学，有空就看看故事书。我现在是笨蛋中的大笨蛋，我嘲笑自己的空虚无聊、无所事事。我们一群人在树林里闲逛，或是打打羽毛球，有时还玩躲猫猫或找头领等益智类游戏，在这方面我简直就是个傻瓜。这儿到处都是野生草莓，一个铜板就能买一堆，足够一顿饭吃的——能装满满一大盘，摞得高高的还止不住往下滚。哎呀呀！哎呀呀！这一大盘都快吃完了，我的胃好像无底洞，我都被自己的贪吃给吓到了。荡秋千……荡得高高的，直冲蓝天。然后下河游泳，举着火把捉虾。顺便告诉你，我们遇见了一个演员。他给我们唱歌、朗诵，还给我们摘好多好多的醋栗。作为回报，我们就用深红色的野生罂粟花、蓝色矢车菊和粉白色的鲜花给他编了一个花环，在他动身去华沙前送给了他。伙伴们说看见他戴上了花环，等火车进站时又把花环装进了行李箱，一路带去了华沙。”

玛妮雅要在乡下度过她整整一年的假期。她热爱乡下的一点一滴。她将亲眼见证四季更迭，发现波兰这片土地角角落落的自然之美。她的叔叔赛维尔住在斯沃拉平原。在这里，她能望见平坦的大地绵延伸向远方，一望无际到天边地平线，绿油油的大地上遍布着一片片土黄色的耕地。叔叔家的马圈里养了许多匹马，于是玛妮雅也学会了骑马。她丝毫不必为骑马的装束而费心。从堂姐妹那里借来的衣服太大，她就用皮带把衣服扎起来，束出一片片衣褶，整装待发。左手拉着缰绳，拽着大马的鬃毛，左脚踩着马镫，右手扶着马鞍，她想像叔叔和堂姐妹那样一跃上马。但想骑到马背上可不是一件容易的事儿！无论她怎么又蹦又跳，就是上不去，那匹温顺的老马站在那里纹丝不动，她还是上不去。

“动作还行！”叔叔说道，“使劲往上爬！”而堂姐妹们也不会对她置之不管。她们教她上马时后背要向着马头的方向，教她可以巧借小土堆上马，最后给她讲跳上马的不同方法，这样即便是最高的马，她也能顺利坐到马鞍上。在绵延不断的田野上骑马远行带给玛妮雅最大的快乐。很快，即便是马儿一路小跑，她也能从马鞍上站起身来；即便快马疾驰，她也能稳坐如山。她骑着马到访了许多新村庄，遇见不同的乡里人，也领略到了越来越多的波兰平原风情。

其实还有更大的惊喜在等着她：玛妮雅后来又去了另一位叔叔家小住，那位叔叔的名字对英国人来说简直无法发音，他叫兹齐斯瓦夫，住在喀尔巴阡山区。这是玛妮雅第一次见到白雪皑皑的高山，它们闪烁着耀眼的白光，深色的松林带像一条条黑色的河流，将白雪衬得愈白……玛妮雅渴望近距离接触雪山；穿过树林走到白雪覆盖的山边。她长途跋涉，沿着蜿蜒的山路一路向上爬。有时候道路戛然而止，悬崖峭壁横在面前，她也就只能沿路折返。有时候，道路的尽头坐落着一间小木屋，玛妮雅和她的堂姐妹们就敲开木屋的门，想要看看屋主人的手艺活儿；所有在这片地区生活的山里人都是木匠，随便一件简单的家具就是一件艺术作品。山上的农民喜欢向人们展示自己的手艺，当孩子们对桌椅板凳、布谷鸟钟及挂在墙上的彩色木碗大加赞叹时，山民们就在橱柜里掏掏拣拣，拿出木刻的小人、酒杯、玩具，甚至还有木刻版画。

一次，玛妮雅闲逛时在山里发现了一个小湖，一汪湖水静静地躺在山间，瓦蓝瓦蓝的，就像长了一大片水蔓菁，山里人也叫它“蓝海之眼”。这汪湖水落在白雪皑皑的山峰之间，显得格外明媚动人。玛妮雅想，这儿风景秀丽，定是整个国家的瑰宝。

家里的生活也超乎寻常地令人感到轻松愉悦。叔叔爱热闹，美丽的婶婶和三个堂姐妹亦是如此，他们整日欢笑，玛妮雅也不觉加入其中。家里的宾客络绎不绝。叔叔婶婶有时候外出打猎，带回山野猎物款待客人。如果没出去打猎，便宰掉一只家禽，反正院子里养着上百只踱来踱去的家禽。女孩们就疾跑到厨房，匆忙地烤制些蛋糕。盛宴一切准备就绪。对于宴会穿的衣服，她们翻箱倒柜找出漂亮的裙子并缝制好，准备猜字谜的时候穿；如果是冬天，就准备好玩“库利格”时能穿的衣服，“库利格”可是严冬里的庆祝活动。

玛妮雅第一次参加“库利格”的经历总是让她记忆犹新。夜空漆黑，但却被北边的白雪映亮。玛妮雅和三个堂姐妹裹着厚厚的毛毯，穿着打扮就像克拉科夫的农民，分坐在两架雪橇上。她们的骑士是穿着朴实的乡下男孩，举着熊熊燃烧的火把照亮黑夜。穿行在漆黑的树林里，他们瞥见周围还有其他火光也在移动。寒冷的夜晚突然间响起了音乐声，原来是乐手来了，随行的还有四个犹太人。在接下来的两天两夜里，他们拉着小提琴，弹奏出扣人心弦的华美乐章。他们演奏华尔兹和玛祖卡舞曲，整个世界都跟着副歌一起欢唱，奏响夜晚的美妙乐章，叽叽喳喳好不热闹。

伴随着犹太人的乐曲，其他雪橇也穿过黑暗加入队伍中，三架、五架、十架，雪橇数不断增多。尽管有些令人汗毛竖起的艰险弯道和草坡，但那些乐手一个音也没错，用音乐引领着队伍在朦胧的星空下一路前行。

系着响铃的雪橇在途中遇到的第一间农舍前停下来，人们卸下挽具，欢笑着，高喊着，大声敲着农舍的屋门，叫醒农舍主人，不过屋主人也只是在假睡。乐手一下子就被举到了桌子上，房间被火把照得通亮，舞会正式开始。

热腾腾的晚餐端上了桌，随即一个手势，整个房子突然空无一人——不见了木桶，不见了欢闹的人群，不见了马匹，不见了雪橇，一切都不见了。一个更庞大的队伍，加上了农舍里的所有雪橇，穿过树林又赶往下一个农场。

几匹健马拉的雪橇在试图超车时，偏离了熟路，没法再返回原路，撞翻在了雪堆里。大部队停下来，火把在风中燃烧，众人围成半个圈，七手八脚地拍掉翻车人身上的雪，扶正他们的雪橇。疾驰的雪橇又响起了叮叮当当的铃声，打破了夜晚的沉寂。不过乐手去哪儿了呢？没有人知道。领头的雪橇滑得越来越快，希望能追赶上乐手；但很快就意识到他们走的并不是同一条路，也就不再继续追赶。队伍停下来，想起了刚才走过的岔路口。没办法只能折回去，去另一条路上看看能不能找到犹太乐手。大家都有点儿担心，找不到乐手可怎么去其他农场跳舞呢？突然这时，有人听到了响铃声中夹杂的那些欢快旋律，队伍终于完整了，而每到一处农场，队伍都会加长，越来越长。

日升……日落……太阳又一次升起。乐手几乎没有时间吃饭和睡觉。第二晚，庞大的雪橇队带着气喘吁吁的马儿和丁零当啷的响铃，在最大的农场门前停了下来，舞会正式开始。

矮小的乐手演奏着响亮的乐曲。宾客们各就各位，准备跳那著名的交谊舞。领舞的男孩帅气优雅，穿着刺绣的白色礼服，向前一步牵住舞姿最优美的舞伴，那便是玛妮雅·斯克沃多夫斯卡。她穿着山林仙女般的梦幻裙子，披着天鹅绒外衣，连着蓬松的亚麻袖，头戴如星星般闪亮的王冠，缀着飘逸鲜艳的彩带。

他们彻夜起舞，清晨八点钟还在跳玛祖卡舞。玛妮雅说她从没有过这样放松愉悦的感觉，婶婶说如果她真的这么喜欢库利格活动，将来结婚时可以采用这种方式来庆祝。

假期带来的欢乐还远未结束。斯克沃多夫斯卡夫人以前的学生，现在已成为弗勒里伯爵夫人，她邀请海拉和玛妮雅同她小住几日。伯爵夫人的公馆坐落在两条河流之间的狭长地带。在玛妮雅住的房间里，刚好能看到河水交汇时的壮丽景象，这段日子也让她学会了划船。她在给家里的信中写道：“只有我们想不到的，没有我们不能玩的。我们每晚睡得安稳，有时候白天也能适当休息。我们跳舞，几乎玩疯了。现在看来只有疯人院能容得下我们啦！”

她们除了睡觉、跳舞，还换着花样来骑马、采蘑菇、讲笑话。一次，玛妮雅写了个便条给伯爵夫人的弟弟，让他去镇上一趟。这个年轻人没起半点疑心，便赶赴镇上。往返小镇路途遥远。等回到家时天已经黑了，走进自己的房间，他才发现原来小伙伴们将他的被褥、桌椅、行李箱、衣服都挂在了屋子的横梁上。他的物品被挂得到处都是，多到在房间里走路随时都会打到脸。

有一天，有尊贵的客人登门拜访，家里准备了丰盛的午宴，孩子们却并未获邀参加。他们在中午前便把那午餐都吃掉了，并在空桌子上放了一个稻草人装扮成一位心满意足、饱餐过的伯爵先生。这些恶作剧的小坏蛋们呢？跑哪儿去了？早都消失得无影无踪啦！

在伯爵先生和夫人的结婚纪念日上，这群淘气的小家伙们送给他们一顶用蔬菜做的巨形王冠。正当夫妻二人乐呵呵地坐在装饰华丽的宝座上时，小家伙们呈上了这个重达一百磅的王冠。最小的孩子背诵了一首诗，这首诗是玛妮雅为了庆典专门作的，结尾如下：

在这受人祝福的美好日子

一顿美味代表我们的心意！

愿每位少女都能觅得如意郎君

如二位一般伉俪情深

共同携手步入神圣殿堂

请赐予我们，赐予我们这欢乐时光

伯爵先生和夫人用尽心思举办了一场舞会。玛妮雅和海拉想要尽情享受那个美好的夜晚。破洞的舞裙尽显二人的穷困。她们数了数钱，又翻来覆去仔细检查舞裙。扯掉褪色的薄纱，发现里衬还能继续穿。两个人决定买点蓝色的塔拉丹薄纱，两边再系上绸带，那就是件新裙子啦。干瘪的钱包和熟练的针线活儿能化腐朽为神奇，其他的地方就用鲜花来装点，剩下的钱能买两双新鞋子。买好了东西，缝好了裙子，也从花园里采好了鲜花，一切准备就绪，望着镜中的俏丽佳人，仿佛在说：“你们是最美的。”

玛妮雅穿着新鞋跳了一整晚，直到跳烂了鞋子，第二天早上便把鞋子扔掉，迎接新的一天。





第五章　人物


玛妮雅回到了华沙。她一双灰色的大眼睛带着笑意审视着这个截然不同的世界，厚实的上嘴唇常常因为欢乐的微笑而颤动，不过脸上仍然挂着严肃的神情。同世界上大多数父亲一样，斯克沃多夫斯基先生也会想方设法让孩子们明白要靠自己的双手养活自己。他不再接受学生寄宿，一家人又重新回到了自己的小房子生活。尽管父亲还在努力赚钱维持房租、女佣和日常开销，但生活已经举步维艰，他们还要考虑到父亲将来只能靠微薄的教师退休金度日。这一点一直困扰着父亲。像世界上大多数父亲一样，他也想赚足够多的钱让家人生活富足。晚上坐在油灯旁，父亲也会深深地叹息。四双明媚的眼睛，或是长春花般浅蓝或是灰亮，都会抬起头来看着父亲，揣测他的想法；四个孩子异口同声抗议道：“爸爸别担心，我们年轻力壮，难道还养活不了自己吗？” 尽管斯克沃多夫斯基先生对孩子们的热忱感到欣慰，但他心里也不免犯嘀咕，自己这辈子没什么建树，不知道孩子们是否能成功。他天资聪慧，勤奋努力，但从生活中得到的物质回报却极少。孩子们会像他一样吗？这个身材矮小、体态臃肿、谢了顶的男人穿着他精心整理却依然破旧的黑外衣坐在灯下。这位父亲的一切都是一丝不苟、整洁利落的：他的字，他的思想，他的言语，甚至是他的行为。他也用同样细腻无微不至的爱抚养孩子们长大。带孩子们出门短游，父亲会提前制定好出行路线，带孩子们领略自然的美景，发现常人不易觉察的美好，大多数人未能发现美是因为无人提及。如果看到著名的古老建筑，父亲会讲述它的历史背景。在玛妮雅的眼中，父亲是完美的。她从未质疑过父亲那一丝不苟、精益求精的态度。她觉得父亲无所不知。事实上，父亲确实学识渊博。他用自己挣来的辛苦钱买了内容丰富的书籍，实时了解物理和化学界的新发现。他精通希腊语、拉丁文和五门当代语言，自己却觉得不足为奇。每周六晚上，父亲都会自己写诗并声情并茂地朗诵给孩子们听，让他们逐步接触到博大的文学世界。有时想给孩子们读些外国名著，比如《大卫·科波菲尔》，他会用波兰语朗读，尽管手中握着的是英文版本。

“家里没什么新变化，”玛妮雅在给朋友的信中写道，“植被真是生长得愈发茂盛！杜鹃开花了，朗斯特睡在毯子上！我把裙子染了，家里的女佣古茜娅正在竭力洗干净它。她已经把布朗尼娅的弄好了，很成功。我既没时间又没钱。有人介绍我们去给一位女士上课；但当布朗尼娅告诉她一小时一先令时，她夺门而出，好像房子着了火。”

然而，不管挣得多不多，玛妮雅都要做家教。那个年代，女孩能做的工作真是少之又少。但她此前从未想过，“我能招多少学生？能挣多少钱？”如果这样想，那就不是玛妮雅了！她有自己的梦想——不像女孩憧憬结婚，不像男孩渴望驾驶。她的梦想是波兰。她，玛妮雅·斯克沃多夫斯卡，必须拯救波兰。仅凭十六岁的青春年华，凭着父亲、学校和书本灌输到她脑袋里的那点东西，如何才能做到呢？玛妮雅知道还有人也怀揣着拯救波兰的梦想，谋划着炸死沙皇。还有人梦想着上帝能回应他们对波兰的祈祷。尽管玛妮雅为帮助一位革命党人而把护照借给了他，她却从没想过上述这些方法。她觉得最务实的方法就是最好的：做好眼前事；向俄国政府竭尽全力愚化的波兰人民传授知识；不断教学、教学、再教学，直到让华沙成为伟大思想的核心摇篮，直到让波兰强大到能引领欧洲。

英法两国目前正在盛行一股新思潮。一位年长玛妮雅十岁的朋友得到了风声，创办了一个秘密社团，名为“双翼学社”，专门研究新思想。玛妮雅、布朗尼娅和海拉都加入了社团。小团体每次在不同的成员家里聚集学习，不是学什么“旁门左道”或稀奇古怪的东西，就是学习解剖、生物和自然历史。然而，突然的敲门声和壁板里老鼠的响动，都会让大家打个激灵。如果警察逮住了他们，那谁都逃不过坐牢的命运。成员们既要学习也要授课。玛妮雅收集了大量图书，建起了一个小小图书馆。她把这些书借给穷人，不过她要提前教会这些人认字和阅读，这样他们才能看懂书。

有些波兰商店愿意让自己的女工下了班后聚在一起，跟着玛妮雅看书学习，开动脑筋，成长为更有作为的波兰公民。压根不用担心有人会将秘密泄露出去。小玛妮雅虽然内心欣喜，但表面上表现得很矜持，面对这群年长且粗犷的女工，她要求她们一句粗话都不能讲，一支烟都不能抽。玛妮雅觉得自己的鬈发太引人注目便索性剪了去，却没意识到剪了头发的自己更显得稚气未脱。她一天到晚忙个不停，什么都想尝试：演讲、参会、画画、写诗、读六七个国家的文学作品——毕竟，要紧紧追随伟大作家的先进思想。

但她思索最多的还是怎样处理布朗尼娅的问题。姐姐一天天长大，至少玛妮雅是这样认为的，如果她不上心根本没人会关注布朗尼娅的前途。每天早上，不论是晴空万里还是刮风下雨，玛妮雅都要去做家教。有钱人让她站在寒风凛凛的走廊里等候，对他们来说玛妮雅不过是名穷家教。“斯克沃多夫斯卡小姐，真不好意思，我女儿今早要晚点上课；不过你还是要上够课时，对吧？”到了月底，课时费又经常忘了给。“真抱歉，我丈夫会两个月一起结给你。”但是玛妮雅当时真的很需要钱。她迫切需要这笔钱来买生活必需品。

布朗尼娅当时面无血色，神情沮丧。玛妮雅不得不先将自己的梦想搁置一旁，暂时放弃自己上大学追求知识的迫切愿望。她必须先为布朗尼娅谋划好出路。

“布朗尼娅，我一直在心里盘算这件事，”某日，玛妮雅说道，“我也和爸爸谈过了。我已经找到了解决办法。”

“解决什么的办法？”

玛妮雅既谨慎又委婉地问道：“布朗尼娅，你现在攒的钱够你在巴黎生活多久？”

“够旅费和一年的生活费，不过学医要五年呢。”布朗尼娅立即回答道。

“好吧，做家教一小时才一先令，根本实现不了咱俩的梦想。”

“那？”

“这样，如果咱俩分头为自己攒钱，谁都成功不了。不过要是按我的计划来，你今年秋天就能坐上前往巴黎的火车。”

“玛妮雅！你不是痴人说梦吧！”

“当然不是。开始你先花自己的钱，然后我会给你寄钱。爸爸也会寄钱给你。同时，我也会给自己攒点钱。等以后你成了医生，就该轮到我去上学，到那时你再帮助我。”

布朗尼娅的眼泪在眼眶里打转，她知道这个提议对玛妮雅意味着什么，不过她也觉得这个“如意算盘”并不好实现。“你怎么能又养活自己，又接济我，并同时给自己存钱呢？”布朗尼娅问道。

“嗨！我一直也在想办法。我想找一个寄宿家教的差事，这样生活就不太用自己花钱了！这个想法是不是很完美？”

“不行，”布朗尼娅说，“我觉得没理由让我先上学。你比我聪明。如果你先上学，很快就能成功，之后我再去。”

“这怎么行？我的傻姐姐，布朗尼娅！你不是已经二十岁，而我才十七岁吗？你已经等待了太久，而我还有时间。年长的先去。等你在诊所谋得了差事，我就能跟着沾光啦！而且我已经下定决心了，就这样决定吧！”

于是九月份，就在她十八岁生日前的一个月，玛妮雅坐在了家庭女教师咨询机构的接待室里，按照自己想象中女教师的样子搭配了穿着。她新长长的头发服帖地顺在褪了色的帽子下面；她的裙子平整朴素；她心平气和、安静如常。

她紧张地走向坐在办公桌后的女士，手里紧紧地握着自己的毕业证和推荐信。那位女士仔仔细细地看着推荐信，突然抬起头看着玛妮雅，甚至是盯着玛妮雅。“你真的会德语、俄语、法语、波兰语和英语吗？”她疑惑地问道。

“是的，”玛妮雅回答道，“虽然英语没有其他语言讲得好，但是授课也能达到考试水平。我高中获得了金质奖章。”

“哦。那你期望的薪水是多少？”

“寄宿家教，一年四十镑。”

“如果有合适的职位，我会联系你的。”带着这个听上去没什么希望的承诺，玛妮雅离开了咨询机构。

不过没多久，玛妮雅就成了一名家庭女教师。那家人的姓名保密，因为他们可不想回忆起命运之神的捉弄。这家人为年仅十八岁的玛妮雅·斯克沃多夫斯卡开了一扇小门，玛妮雅后来告诉我们，如果当时穿过这扇门便可以隐隐预见日后悲惨的生活，她肯定不会进去。生活注定要让玛妮雅成为一位将天赋发挥到极致的英才，而不是郁郁寡欢、遭人白眼的小奴隶。这户B姓人家家境富裕，他们时刻提醒家庭教师自己的身份地位，对玛妮雅讲话更是冷若冰霜，唯恐暴露出自己内心的想法。他们在众人面前广施财富，却克扣了玛妮雅六个月的工资，又不让她在晚上读书，以免浪费灯油。他们人前讲话浓情蜜意，而一转脸背过身去便诽谤中伤，玛妮雅说这家人可是把朋友们也批驳得一无是处、体无完肤。

“我从他们身上学到，”玛妮雅写道，“现实世界中还真有书本里说的那种人，不与利欲熏心的人为伍才是明智之举。”也许就是在十八岁的年纪懂得的道理，让玛妮雅·斯克沃多夫斯卡在日后面对任何财富的诱惑都能保持初心、不为所动！

然而，玛妮雅的计划并没有奏效。住在镇上的B姓人家里，她发现自己每天都会产生一点儿花费。时不时能见到父亲，能与双翼学社的朋友们保持联系都很让人高兴，但一旦决定执行计划就必须坚持下去，无论付出什么代价。玛妮雅觉得自己必须彻底离开家，在偏远的乡下找份工作，这样就几乎不会有什么其他花费了。只有这样，已经远在巴黎的布朗尼娅才能达成自己的心愿。

玛妮雅苦苦寻找的职位终于出现了。远在乡下，而且薪水更高一点——一年五十镑。当然，那个时代的五十镑可比现在值钱多了。然而，玛妮雅还是怀着沮丧的心情给了父亲自己的新地址，不过对父亲来说新地址听上去并没有那么偏远和奇怪。

玛妮雅·斯克沃多夫斯卡

Z先生——

斯图集村

近普扎斯内什市

一月份，玛妮雅动身前往乡下，一月份的波兰已是一连积了好几个月的雪。当火车缓缓驶出车站，玛妮雅再也看不到向自己挥手的父亲了。这也是她人生中第一次独自一人，第一次感到迷茫害怕。遥远村庄里的那些陌生面孔很可能会像上一任雇主那样冰冷严酷，村庄偏僻更是让人逃脱不得。而父亲一天天变老，很可能会生病要人照顾。她留下父亲远赴乡下，这样做对吗？夜色渐浓，白雪覆盖的平原在夜幕下绵延至远方，但在玛妮雅的泪水中一切早已变得模糊。

坐了三个小时的火车后，玛妮雅还要再搭乘雪橇。她浑身裹着暖融融的毛毯，在漫天白雪的冬夜里一路前行，四周寂静，唯有雪橇铃叮当作响。

雪橇足足跑了四个小时。玛妮雅饥寒交迫，想着马儿到底什么时候才能把她送到。随后她看到了一小片光亮、一扇打开的门，全家人都出来迎接她——高大的屋主人、女主人，还有抓着妈妈衣裙有些害羞的孩子们，眼神里充满了好奇。女主人用热情友好的话语欢迎玛妮雅的到来，给她端来热腾腾的茶水，亲自将她领到准备好的房间，周到地留下玛妮雅一人暖和暖和身子，收拾一下随身带来的旧行李箱。

玛妮雅身处偏远乡下。她环视四周，满意地打量着房间雪白的墙壁、简洁的装饰和壁橱里的热炉子。

第二天早晨，她拉开窗帘，本以为会看见白茫茫的田野和白雪覆盖的森林，但眼前看到的却是工厂冒着黑烟的烟囱。她向后退了几步并再度放眼望去——有好多烟囱，看不见一棵树、一丛灌木、一个树篱。原来她来到了甜菜生产区。目光所及之处全是开垦好的准备种植甜菜的耕地。整个乡村都在种植甜菜。农民们开垦、播种、丰收。那些工厂也都是甜菜精炼厂。村里部分屋舍就是炼厂的工人们在工厂围墙边搭建的。玛妮雅住的这家男主人是炼厂厂长。村边的河流里也都漂着甜菜根。

玛妮雅看到工厂有些失望。对于周围大户人家的年轻男女亦是如此。人们谈论的话题无非就是家长里短、穿衣打扮，谁家要办舞会以及上场舞会持续了多久。有次Z先生和太太跳完舞回到家都中午一点了，这让玛妮雅甚是吃惊，她可能早都忘了自己上次跳舞到清晨八点的欢乐愉悦。“赐我一支讽刺漫画家的神笔，”她说道，“可以让我把这里的某些人好好描绘描绘。女孩都是大笨蛋，连怎么开口说话都不会，唯有我的学生布兰卡，这家的大女儿，聪明理性、热爱生活，就像一颗闪闪发光的珍珠。”除了布兰卡，斯图集村另一个有趣的人便是她三岁的弟弟斯塔斯了。他可是这所大平房的活力之源。他迈着小步子啪嗒啪嗒地到处跑，走下长长的楼梯，跑到外面的玻璃阳台上，阳台上面的藤蔓叶子掉光了，略显破败。而他咿咿呀呀的话语更是逗乐了玛妮雅。一次保姆告诉他上帝无处不在。“斯塔斯不喜欢那样，”他回答道，“我担心他会抓到我！他会咬我吗？”

而十岁的安迪亚是玛妮雅的问题学生，喜欢乱跑乱动，家里一来客人她就跑得不见了踪影。玛妮雅一天本该给她上四个小时的课，但她不断逃课，好不容易被抓回来还要再从头上起，使得授课并没有什么大的进展。安迪亚还喜欢赖床，玛妮雅每天必须拽着她的胳膊把她拖下床，每次这个过程都让玛妮雅气不打一处来。某天早上，玛妮雅花了两个小时才渐渐平息怒火、恢复平静。 玛妮雅一天最快乐的时光便是和布兰卡一起读书的三小时，以及业余能写信回家的休闲时光。“复活节的时候，我就回到华沙啦，”她写道，“每每想起这件事，我的心就明朗起来，控制着自己不再像野人一般大喊大叫。”

走在泥泞的村庄小道，玛妮雅看见了村里脏兮兮的男孩女孩。乱蓬蓬的头发下，他们明亮的眼睛上下打量着她。“这不也是波兰人吗？”她自顾自地说道，“我发誓要教书育人，难道不该为这些孩子做些什么吗？” 这些穿着破烂的孩子要么一无所知，要么只知道俄国字母表。玛妮雅想，给这些孩子秘密开设一间波兰学校将是件值得做的事情。

布兰卡听到这个想法后为之一振。“别高兴得太早，”玛妮雅说，“如果我们被抓住了，等待我们的那可是西伯利亚，你知道的。”两个人都知道西伯利亚的寓意——流亡在万里冰川的恶劣平原。但布兰卡甘愿冒此风险。两个人征得了Z先生的同意——正式开课了。

幸运的是，有一条户外楼梯直通玛妮雅的房间。十到十八个脏兮兮的小孩子爬着楼梯来上课。玛妮雅借来一些桌椅板凳，又花了原本就弥足珍贵的不多的积蓄给孩子们买了练习本和钢笔。欢乐也随即而来。笨拙的小手们握着不熟悉的钢笔，在雪白的纸上歪歪扭扭地画着字母。慢慢地，这些小顽童们就意识到原来自己听到的话语都可以在白纸上用黑字表达出来。孩子们的父母并不识字，因而为此颇感骄傲，纷纷走上木楼梯，在教室后面兴奋地看着孩子们的“伟大举动”。但其实孩子们学写字并不那么轻松容易。他们表情纠结、眉头紧皱、嘟嘟囔囔，就好像写字跟把甜菜根搬上山一样艰难。玛妮雅和布兰卡围着孩子们转，帮助他们写字。这些学生们脏兮兮的，经常走神，并不十分聪明，但大多时候，他们明亮的大眼睛里闪现着对上课的兴奋和对知识的渴求。





第六章　不幸中的万幸


夏天来临，其他人都放暑假了，但家庭教师一年到头都要坚守岗位。男孩们放假回家、女孩们在酷暑寒冬要起床的时候，玛妮雅的作用就显得格外突出。玛妮雅厌倦了这一切。生活没有一丝变化。明天不过是昨天的复制粘贴——早上从八点工作到十一点半，下午从两点到七点半，中午十一点半到两点是午餐及散步时间。晚上，如果安迪亚表现好就给她读书；表现不好的话，玛妮雅就做些针线活儿，顺便和她聊聊天。晚上九点才终于迎来了属于自己的自由时间，可以读书学习。不过就算这时，她也经常被打断，去做一些家庭教师要做的杂七杂八的小事。比如，安迪亚的教父让她陪着下棋；打牌三缺一，才不会管家庭教师到底喜不喜欢玩牌。玛妮雅对知识越来越如饥似渴，因为学习的机会越来越少。她的书已经陈旧过时，也没有人能听她倾诉自己的痛苦。她不知道自己该怎么办。她羡慕世界各地那些能自由上学的女孩，面临这个年龄该有的选择，接触大师们的先进思想，在实验室里学习和工作。维也纳、柏林、伦敦、圣彼得堡，尤其是巴黎，简直就是玛妮雅心中的神圣殿堂！不，不能是维也纳、柏林或圣彼得堡，它们可是波兰压迫者们的首都。但伦敦和巴黎可以！她极度向往巴黎，自由包容的巴黎不会压迫任何人，反而张开怀抱欢迎流亡的异乡人，拥抱那些渴求知识的人们。玛妮雅感到了深深的绝望。独自一人努力拼搏太过辛苦。存钱的速度极度缓慢， 布朗尼娅用钱的日子还长。父亲以后年老体衰了还需要她来照顾。玛妮雅还能去上大学吗？

玛妮雅已经出落得明媚动人。一头光滑迷人的秀发，宽阔高挺的额头，显露出无比的坚毅；精心勾勒的眉毛下嵌着一双灰色的大眼睛，灵动而深邃；随性的嘴巴带着一丝浅浅的笑意，让人不由得多看几眼。她肌如桃花，优雅迷人，手腕脚腕长得十分秀气；而她的睿智聪慧更为她增加了一层神秘感，让人充满好奇，想要一探究竟。

家中的长子卡西米尔放暑假回到家，很高兴结识了玛妮雅。他第一次遇见玛妮雅，是在花园里看见她在修剪枯萎的玫瑰。他从妹妹的来信中已经听说了关于玛妮雅的事，不过他并不相信，家庭女教师难道不是乏味无聊的代言人吗？

“但是……以祖国波兰的名义发誓！” 他自语道，“这一位截然不同！”

“老师，您今早给扶贫学校放假啦？”

“没有！” 玛妮雅说，她的脸上一如既往闪现着兴奋，“他们要忙其他事，五点以后才能来上课。”

玛妮雅想这是布兰卡深爱的哥哥，眼前这位高大英俊、举止迷人的年轻学生讲话温柔友好，对她的学生甚是关心，虽然一直坚持将她创建的学校称作“扶贫学校”。

当天晚上九点钟，玛妮雅并没有像往常一样去读那些沉重的书本。能和一位大学生切身聊聊他所学的专业会让人受益良多。明日再也不是昨日的复制品了。暑期打乱了之前工作的时间安排。卡西米尔坚持要划船野餐，而玛妮雅正是划船的好手。她骑马英姿飒爽，而马圈里大有可供挑选的骏马。三人从四十多匹马中挑出自己心仪的，整日在一望无际的平原上肆意驰骋。有时，一家人也驾着马车出去野餐，卡西米尔注意到玛妮雅纤细的手腕能自如地控制另一驾马车的缰绳。卡西米尔的左手拇指扭伤了，于是车夫就只能赶着第一驾马车，载着母亲和孩子们。

卡西米尔见过无数的“呆头鹅”，没人能有玛妮雅这样的谈吐和神秘感。秋季开学，卡西米尔重回华沙，他又开始盼望冬季圣诞节能够回家。

“最好永远都是冬季。”他说。听到玛妮雅大感吃惊的回答“不好！为什么呢？”他笑了。“我们不是要崇尚美好的事物吗？还有什么比一位脚踝优美、滑冰优雅的女孩更令人愉悦的呢？还有跳舞！你舞跳得那么好，难道你不喜欢跳舞，不喜欢在冬季的星空下滑着雪橇到处穿行吗？”

是的，玛妮雅再次回归了舞会，但她还是喜欢夏季——喜欢暑期。

“暑期？我在这儿的时候？”

卡西米尔一直在猜测她的答案。他说自己立马就要去征得父亲的同意。人们通常不会娶家庭女教师，但玛妮雅与众不同，简直完全不同。家里的每个人都喜欢她：父亲邀她一同散步；母亲把她介绍给自己的朋友；他的妹妹们更是喜欢玛妮雅。家人经常邀请玛妮雅的父亲、兄弟姐妹来家里做客；玛妮雅过生日时，全家人给她送礼物、送鲜花。他们肯定满怀期待，等着玛妮雅成为自家的儿媳。

但关于这一点，卡西米尔其实大错特错。当他告知父母自己要娶玛妮雅为妻时，父亲勃然大怒，母亲几乎晕厥。他们对自己的长子寄予厚望，期待他把整个乡下最富足高贵的女孩娶回家，怎么会同意让他去娶一个一无所有的家庭女教师，去娶一个在别人家打工谋生的女人？

“卡西米尔，你疯了吧！正常人谁会娶家庭女教师！”

“谁会娶家庭女教师呀！多好笑！”整片大地都在低沉回荡着这句话。地球绕着太阳高速运转，带来春夏秋冬的四季更迭。正是如此，才有了日后的玛丽·居里，而非玛妮雅·卡西米尔·Z夫人。

但当时并不能预见未来的玛妮雅心情十分抑郁。卡西米尔的家人对她开始变得冷漠，但她还不能辞掉工作一走了之，因为她每年还要给布朗尼娅寄二十镑。她唯一能做的就是下决心再也不会爱上任何人。生活又开始重复，日复一日。她教课，批评安迪亚，叫醒朱力克（因为不管什么书都能把朱力克送入梦乡），给扶贫学校上课，读化学书，下棋，跳舞，散步。只有一件事偶尔能给她带来点欢乐：当道路的边际模糊，有时完全消失在白雪下，雪橇连人一起翻到了白雪覆盖的沟壑里。这种情况下，人们会哈哈大笑，依稀能恢复一些往日的友善和快乐。

那段时间，玛妮雅给家里写的信更长了，但经常因为没钱买邮票而无法寄出。“好久都没收到布朗尼娅的来信了，”她抱怨道，“不过可能她也没邮票吧。”基于自身的忧伤，她也更能理解父亲、哥哥和海拉面临的困境。她写信给父亲，“别担心我们，您已尽到了一位父亲应尽的责任，您不是还教会了我们善良的品行吗？我们肯定能挣钱养活自己的。” 她在给哥哥的信中写道：“约瑟夫，借上一百卢布，好好待在华沙。别把自己埋没在乡下，也别因为我给你提建议而恼怒。还记得我们约定要有什么就说什么。大家都觉得在乡下行医就是坐井观天，不会有什么大的发展。缺少药店、医院和书籍的支持，医生就会变得束手无策，无论你怀揣多么崇高的治病救人的理想。亲爱的哥哥，如果这件事发生在你身上，我一定会悲痛万分，因为我现在对自己已经完全失去信心，唯把希望寄托在你和布朗尼娅身上。你不能埋没了我们家族世代相传的天赋。这些天赋必须在我们某个人的身上体现出来。我越对自己失望，便越对你充满希望。” 玛妮雅对海拉也充满爱怜，那会儿海拉被爱人抛弃，也由此对男人充满了愤恨。“说真的，”她写道，“人要学会认清他人！如果不想娶贫穷的女孩，就让他们见鬼去吧。没人强迫他们这样做，为什么还要与穷女孩相爱，然后又让她们伤心落泪？”

这是玛妮雅人生的低谷期。她担心自己受学生影响，脑子会变得愚笨僵化，很多教师都有这样的担忧。她的远大梦想看起来愚蠢可笑。“我现在唯一的愿望，”她写道，“就是有一个属于自己的小角落，能让我和父亲安身。要是能获得独立并有属于自己的家，我宁愿折寿。如果能离开Z一家，虽然不太可能，我就在华沙的某间寄宿学校里谋一份差事，再私下带点课挣些外快。这就是我唯一希望的事。生活不值得这样操心忧愁。”确实，这是她人生的低谷期。但一本名为《尼曼河河畔》的小说有幸提醒到她，真正的玛妮雅身上不该有这样消极的想法。“我的梦想都到哪儿去了？”她给布朗尼娅写信，“我想为人们做点事情，突破重重困难教会了十几个村里的男孩女孩读书写字。这是为了提醒他们自己是谁，自己能为世界做些什么！人们根本无法想象这种境况。生活是艰难的。我变得如此狭隘平庸。突然有这样一本书让我为之一振，我也为此痛苦不已。”与此同时，她给堂姐妹写信：“我处于黑色幽默之中，每日面对的就是凛冽的西风，夹杂着雨水、洪水和泥土。连霜都没有，我的滑冰鞋忧伤地挂在衣橱里。你们可能不清楚，在我们这个小地方，霜就像加利西亚的保守党和自由党人之间的辩论那样重要！不要认为你的故事会让我感到无趣。相反，能听到大地上其他地方还有人在活动甚至思考，都让人为之振奋！我只能用暴力手段粗暴地感知生活！随即我摇醒自己，逃脱出梦魇重新做回自己，我告诉自己：‘不要被其他人或其他事击垮。’但对新环境、新变化和新活动的渴望有力地督促着我，让我想做一些极度随性的事来结束这漫长且一成不变的生活。幸运的是，我有许多工作要做，因而这种念头并没有对我产生太多的影响。”





第七章　变化


玛妮雅渴望变化，而且即将迎来变化。她将远行。听说华沙有位学生，不过目前正远在比利时度假，玛妮雅要去比利时与她会合。玛妮雅突然开始怀疑自己是不是能欣然接受这么大的生活变化。她要独自一人远行，换乘五趟火车。她肯定会走丢的；或者小偷会趁她睡觉的时候，在半夜偷偷潜进她的车厢。但这些情况一次也没发生。她安全到达目的地，见到自己的新雇主，来到一个崭新的世界——一个到处充斥着财富并且也能让她享受其中的世界。学生的妈妈长得美丽迷人。这是玛妮雅人生中第一次见到沃斯牌的漂亮裙子；她能亲手触摸到柔软的皮草，欣赏到闪耀的首饰；她身边交往到的朋友，他们的肖像就挂在墙上，而且往往是出自著名画家之手。她在财富营造出的美好事物间游走，欣赏着魅力四射的舞会派对，倾听音乐，享受快乐，而且这些富人平易近人。F夫人很喜欢玛妮雅，走到哪儿都带着她，并在朋友们面前称她为“精致可爱的斯克沃多夫斯卡小姐”。

我们无法得知玛妮雅本人对这一切的真实想法，因为她很快会遇到一件更令人兴奋的事。大厅的桌子上放着一封信，上面盖着巴黎的邮戳，写着斯克沃多夫斯卡小姐亲启，是布朗尼娅的笔迹——这是布朗尼娅在课间休息时急急忙忙用方格练习纸写的信。好消息！布朗尼娅要结婚了！她在信中说一旦在巴黎有了属于自己的家，就邀请玛妮雅过去同住！巴黎！……大学……她所有的梦都要实现了吗？

事情远没那么简单。此前，玛妮雅就知道布朗尼娅和一个在巴黎求学的波兰学生订婚了，男孩聪明帅气、性格开朗。他的名字和玛妮雅唯一的爱人一样，也叫卡西米尔，卡西米尔·杜鲁斯基。他不得已逃离波兰，因为涉嫌一起谋反案。在巴黎，他还是生活在俄国沙皇派来的警察的监视之下，巴黎宪兵队的名录上也记录着各种各样对他不利的信息。但尽管这样，他仍是一名年轻有为的医生，并且即将与布朗尼娅完婚。因此，布朗尼娅再也没机会回到华沙照顾父亲。照顾父亲的重任就落到了玛妮雅的肩上，因为海拉对照顾人也不在行。

只看布朗尼娅的描述，未来是多么美好，多么愉快，多么理想！但玛妮雅在回信中写道：“我一直以来就是个傻瓜，十足的大傻瓜，以后还会这样傻下去，或者用句当下流行的话语，我从未被命运眷顾过！” 因而不幸的事也许会接二连三垂青于她。她继续写道：“我渴望巴黎就像人类渴望救赎，但对巴黎的希望很久以前就破灭了，而当现在前往巴黎的机会再次降临时，我变得不知所措。我不能跟爸爸说这件事，我觉得他一心想着我们明年要在一起生活，我也想给他的晚年带来一些快乐。另一方面，每当想起白白浪费掉的才华，我的心都要碎了，才华就该物尽其用，充分发挥。”玛妮雅正是因为觉得才华要充分发挥，才在同一封信中催促布朗尼娅收起自己的骄傲，用尽一切逢迎的技巧，祈求一位富人朋友帮助约瑟夫发挥他的才能。玛妮雅写道不单单是约瑟夫自己能得到帮助，整个世界都会因他的才华而受益。玛妮雅终其一生都秉持一种观点：世界上最崇高的工作就是帮助极具天赋的人将他们的才华发挥得淋漓尽致。她在结尾写道：“我心情阴郁，我觉得自己不该跟你讲这些事，影响到你的幸福。”

于是，玛妮雅回到家，和爸爸在一间属于自家的小房子里共同生活了至少一年。对某些人来说这可能略显枯燥，但玛妮雅很聪明，她能在家中发现一些更加合理的讨论。她也重返了双翼学社这个秘密社团，进行学习交流。

但命运总深藏一些意料之外的事情。五月，走在克拉科夫幽静的绿荫大道上，闻着绿草如茵的66号庭院中那株紫色丁香花的香气，没有人能想到这儿会发生什么意想不到或震惊世界的大事。庭院里的丁香花旁，有一幢窗户狭小的小平房。门上写着几个大字：工农业博物馆。难道这里会收藏古老的犁头或史前的铲子？才不是！俄国人还是保留了博物馆。一直以来，博物馆都是沉寂、无人问津的地方。但任何有学问的人都可以在博物馆里教书。玛妮雅的表哥是这间博物馆的馆长，也在此秘密教授科学。他还有一间实验室，可以让学生们亲自动手做实验。

玛妮雅·斯克沃多夫斯卡生平第一次走进实验室！而这将对日后的世界产生巨大的影响。她不能经常去实验室，只在晚上和周末才有空。实验室里也没有老师指导。她独自一人尝试按照书本上的描述进行实验。实验结果有时无法预期，有时一点小小的成功会让她燃起希望，而有时一次意外失败又令她深感绝望，但不变的是她勇于探索、不断尝试探究未知奥妙的精神。

深夜回到家，玛妮雅缩进被子里，有些事紧紧萦绕着她，在她的脑海里挥之不去，在黑暗中向她喃喃诉说。她无法入睡，就好像身体里还藏着一个人在与自己对话，揣摩着自己的想法，并告诉自己该起床做些什么。工作自己找上门来，必须坚持做完。博物馆里的试管还有曲颈瓶和父亲之前收藏的物理仪器同属一类，玛妮雅甚是喜欢。玛妮雅·斯克沃多夫斯卡找到了自我——精巧的双手必须永远摆弄试管和火苗、元素和金属，聪明的大脑会从手里的工作中得出结论，还能洞察未来。

不过她该怎么办呢？双手和大脑都鼓励她继续前行！而亲情却提醒她要留下来陪伴父亲和兄弟姐妹，留下来陪伴爱人卡西米尔·Z先生，他还在努力争取赢得父母对两个人婚姻的许可。放假了，两个人终于能够碰面。他们一起上山，他滔滔不绝地讲述自己的痛苦处境，征求她的建议。

“如果你自己都想不出办法，”玛妮雅终于失去了耐心，吼道，“那也别来问我。”她至少最终还能明白自己真实的想法。她匆匆忙忙地给布朗尼娅写信，“给我个明确的答复。我不会给你添麻烦的。我睡在哪儿都行。但我祈求你真实地回答我。”

布朗尼娅做了诚挚的回答。如果电报不那么贵，她肯定就发电报了。玛妮雅如果没有那么多事情要安排，她肯定就搭最近的一班火车了。她把自己所有的积蓄摊在桌子上，和父亲一起清点。父亲也倾其所有，拿出了自己的积蓄。他们眼前摆在桌上的圆卢布，让去巴黎成为可能，但也仅仅只是可能。

就连一路都只坐三等车厢，玛妮雅也负担不起。在波兰和法国，三等车厢就是最便宜的，但德国还有四等车厢。四等车厢就像大型的行李车。中间光秃秃的，没有隔间，贴着四面车厢壁各放一个长条凳，细心的人自己会带小板凳坐在车厢中间。玛妮雅就可以这样做。她要带很多行李，以便在巴黎节省开支，但她能用行李车托运的最大物件便是床垫、毯子、床单和桌布。她唯一要买的就是一个廉价结实的大木箱，她在上面骄傲地写上了玛妮雅·斯克沃多夫斯卡的首字母“M.S.”。她在木箱里放了结实耐穿的衣服、鞋子和两顶帽子，随后又放了旅途中要随身带的东西：坐火车三天的吃食、板凳、书、一包焦糖和一条毯子。

玛妮雅动身前往巴黎。二十四岁的她，眼睛里闪烁着期待和愉悦的光芒。期待已久的旅程正式开始了。





第八章　“我抓来太阳，随手又将它丢在一边……”


“我抓来太阳，随手又将它丢在一边……”玛妮雅看到这句话笑出了声。自己在哪儿？在巴黎的中心。一切有趣和自由的事情都有可能在这儿发生，而她伟大的老师保尔·阿佩尔也遵从自己的内心，想教什么就教什么，想怎么教就怎么教。如果他讲授真理，那么就会有大批的学生拥入课堂。

玛妮雅很早就来上课，在巴黎大学圆形剧场式的教室里挑了一个前排位置坐下，将笔记本和笔盒整齐地摆在面前的课桌上。周围充斥着人群走进教室的喧闹声，但玛妮雅什么都听不到；她完全沉浸在自己的思考当中。教授走进来，教室瞬间安静了下来，在座的学生都是心潮澎湃的数学家，他们期待学术上的美妙碰撞。

阿佩尔教授晃着他方方正正的脑袋，身穿一袭深黑色长袍，显得严肃庄重，他清楚地解释着为何行星会有规律地按照自身位置移动，而地球也要遵循规律运行。他玩转着数字和星星，带领着学生在广阔的宇宙间勇敢探索，大胆探知宇宙最深处的奥秘。他讲课简直就是行云流水、挥洒自如，刚好印证了那句话，“我抓来太阳，随手又将它丢在一边……”

玛妮雅很高兴。怎么会有人觉得科学枯燥乏味？宇宙间亘古不变的规律多么精妙，而人类大脑能够理解这些规律又多么神奇。科学难道不比童话故事更奇幻，比探险书更扣人心弦吗？此刻能听到学界泰斗口中的那句话，就算吃再多年的苦也值：“我抓来太阳，随手又将它丢在一边……”

不过玛妮雅在巴黎还有许许多多其他的收获！当她跳下火车来到烟雾弥漫、喧闹嘈杂的北站，她挺起胸膛贪婪地呼吸着外面的空气，丝毫没注意到烟雾。这是她第一次呼吸到一个自由国度的空气。车站外的一切都是那么不可思议。贫民区的孩子们率性地用自己的语言调侃着彼此；对于一个只能讲俄语的波兰孩子来说根本无法想象！书店可以自主卖书，世界各地的书籍随便挑，太不可思议了！

玛妮雅跳上生平所乘的第一辆公交车，爬到顶层的廉价座位上，更令人振奋的是脚下这条路，它将把玛妮雅·斯克沃多夫斯卡送到一所向女性敞开大门的大学！而且还是一所知名大学！巴黎大学举世闻名。甚至那个德国人马丁·路德都曾说过，巴黎拥有全世界最著名的学府。学校正在重新修建，随处可见装修工人，到处都是烟尘和噪音。随着装修进度的改变，上课地点也不停变更。但这些对玛妮雅没有丝毫影响。她终于能学自己渴望已久的知识了。

玛妮雅开始用法语书写自己的教名——玛丽。不过姓氏无法法语化。年轻的同学们觉得玛丽的姓氏发音太艰难，这也是她受到孤立的部分原因。在长长的走廊里，他们也会不时地回望这个穿着朴素、秀发飘逸、眼睛明亮的外来人。“她是谁呀？”一名同学问道。“就是那个名字古怪的外国人，”旁边的同学回答道，“听说她物理成绩总是数一数二，但不怎么爱说话。”

玛丽必须奋发学习。她不知和同学比起来自己还是多么的无知。她的法语也不像自己想象的那样交流无碍。课堂上也有整句整句听不懂的时候。她发现自己的数学和物理还有很大的进步空间。她决心要努力学习以弥补自己的缺陷。

刚开始寄居在布朗尼娅和卡西米尔家里的那段日子还算顺心。布朗尼娅简直就是居家达人，把一切打理得整齐舒适。她在巴黎郊外租了一间公寓，房租比市里便宜得多，借了些钱把房子装修了一番。她可不是那种会担心还不上借款的人。她还要在家里添置一些精致的家当，如绣着精美花边的窗帘、体面洋气的家具、钢琴，还有插着娇嫩鲜花的花瓶。在不大的厨房里，布朗尼娅能烹饪出精美的菜肴，烘烤出香浓的蛋糕，用从波兰运来的茶叶沏出沁香的茶水，因为她一直觉得总有些东西是巴黎无法出产的。

她们所住的街区在中世纪是专门为屠夫修盖的，于是杜鲁斯基医生的病人也大多是屠夫。他们在小书房里接诊，这间书房是专门腾出来给杜鲁斯基瞧病用的，每天都有固定的时间段。其他时间，布朗尼娅就在这间小书房里给屠夫们怀孕的妻子做检查。到了晚上，两位医生都将工作搁在一旁，并怂恿着初来巴黎的妹妹一同去参加各种娱乐活动。如果手里有点闲钱，他们就会买最便宜的票去剧院看戏；如果没钱了，就在家弹琴或者召集同样背井离乡的波兰朋友们开个茶话会，油灯旁充斥着交谈、欢笑和调侃，茶桌上摆着布朗尼娅烘焙的蛋糕。玛丽通常会早早地从聚会中抽出身来，回到房间继续学习，因为她总觉得自己根本没时间闲玩。

“快出来吧，书虫小姐！”一天晚上，卡西米尔在门外喊道，“是波兰在呼唤你，这次你一定得去。快拿上帽子和大衣，快点！我可是拿到了音乐会的门票哦。”

“可是……”

“可是什么可是！就是我们之前说过的那个年轻的波兰人，没什么人买他的票。我们得去给他撑撑场。我还叫了自愿前往的人，我们可得去给他鼓掌捧场，让他觉得自己成功了。你不知道他钢琴弹得有多美！”

卡西米尔的眼睛乌黑闪亮，玛丽根本无法拒绝自己面前这位快活巧言的姐夫。她急忙跑下楼，穿好衣服，冲上旧马车。她坐在一半座位都空着的音乐厅里，看着那个瘦瘦高高、面庞英俊、一头红发的年轻人走上舞台，打开琴盖。她认真地听着……他手指弹出美妙的音符，仿佛是李斯特、舒曼、肖邦再世。玛丽被深深地感动了。钢琴家穿着破旧的大衣，冲着空荡荡的观众席弹琴，但在玛丽看来他可不是什么无名小卒，而是国王，是几乎神一样的存在。

杜鲁斯基邀请他到家中做客。他带着自己美丽的未婚妻欣然前往，他未婚妻和玛丽的妈妈碰巧还是旧相识。斯克沃多夫斯卡夫人过去曾提到过这个女孩，说她美丽动人，简直不敢带出门。有时，这个红头发的年轻人会走到杜鲁斯基的钢琴前，在他的演奏下，这件寻常物件立刻变得神圣庄重，响彻着天籁之音。这个演奏者是帕德雷夫斯基，将来某一天会成为世界名人，他起初只是一位钢琴家，随后成为自由波兰的总理。

但那时离帕德雷夫斯基成为总理的日子还很遥远。1891年，玛丽旅居巴黎，周围是一群流亡法国的波兰人，他们建立起了一小片波兰区。他们年轻，他们活跃，他们贫穷。每逢节假日，这些人共同聚会，一切尽可能仿照波兰习俗。吃波兰蛋糕，玩波兰游戏，用波兰语打印活动项目，并用波兰的风景图来装饰：茫茫雪原上的村庄，志向高远的男孩在专心读书，圣诞老人在往烟囱里投递科学书籍，老鼠在啃空钱包。他们演话剧时，玛丽根本没时间去仔细了解人物；但在情景剧里，她有次要演绎“冲破枷锁的波兰”。穿着古代人穿的束腰外衣，裙边摇曳着波兰国旗的颜色，秀发勾勒着她斯拉夫民族的面庞，年轻人都觉得她就是波兰之光。

但即使是在自由的巴黎，公开表达对波兰的爱国之情也是件危险的事。斯克沃多夫斯基先生苦口婆心地劝说玛丽不要再参加波兰的欢庆活动，因为这些活动很可能会见报。“你要知道，”他在信中写道，“有些人专门在巴黎记录那些参加波兰活动的人的名字，这可能会给你招来麻烦，影响你以后在波兰找工作。远离聚光灯才是明智之举。”

玛丽其实不太需要父亲的提醒。她想全身心地投入工作中去，一个人住，远离钢琴，远离姐夫每晚喋喋不休的高谈阔论，远离朋友们的登门拜访。她还想住到学校附近，节省通勤时间和费用。

于是在杜鲁斯基夫妇的陪伴下，玛丽略带忧伤地离开了姐姐家的舒适和友善，开始找工作的地方，也开始了自己的孤独之旅。

她即将过上自己梦想中的生活，完全沉浸在学习中的生活。为了能过上这样的生活，她一周只有一镑，甚至更少的生活费。此外，还要负担房租、食物、衣服、稿纸、书籍和大学学费。能负担得起吗？这是个需要认真计算的数学问题，好在玛丽很擅长数学，但仍需要精打细算。“啊！”她想，“我可以少吃点！” 她没时间练厨艺。朋友们更经常打趣说她连汤里面该放什么都不知道。她是不知道，也根本没时间去了解。她无法想象要浪费研读物理的时间去准备一顿晚餐。于是她每天就吃些面包黄油、樱桃和茶水，偶尔吃个鸡蛋或一块巧克力。

她租的房子很便宜——一周四先令六便士。不过就是间屋顶的阁楼，有面斜窗能透点亮光，没暖气，没煤气，也没自来水。屋子里唯一的家具就是一张可折叠的架子床和从波兰带来的床垫，一个炉子，一张松木桌，一把厨房椅，一个盥洗盆，一盏昏暗的油灯，一个能到一楼提水用的水桶，一盏做饭用的酒精灯，两个盘子，一副刀叉，一个汤匙，一个茶杯，一口平底锅，一把茶壶和三个茶杯。如果有来客，她的大木箱子上还能坐两个人。

一年需要用两袋木炭，玛丽在大街上买到木炭，然后一桶一桶地提上六楼，尽其所能地为自己提供温暖。但对于光亮，她一点办法都没有。夜幕一降临，她就去圣杰纳维夫图书馆读书，胳膊肘支在长桌上，双手撑着头，直到晚上十点闭馆。回到家，她就点上油灯，学习到深夜两点才上床睡觉。

食物、住所、取暖和照明的问题都解决了。至于衣服，玛丽能缝会补，她打算通过勤缝补、勤清洗让衣服干净整洁，这样就不用再添置新衣服。租屋的水池里就能洗衣服，不过是费点肥皂。

这就是她给自己规划的简朴生活，任何事情都不能打扰她学习。但女孩的身体总有反映自己的问题的方法。看完书后她经常会觉得晕眩，对此她也很诧异。有时还没躺到床上就在半路晕倒了。恢复意识后，她自觉生病了；但即便如此，她也不太在意，简单地认为自己很快就会好转。

玛丽做医生的姐夫说她看上去像生病了，她推托说自己只是太忙了，并把话题转移到外甥身上。她特别宠爱布朗尼娅刚出生的孩子，并把注意力集中在小家伙身上。

不过有一天，玛丽当众晕倒了，有个姑娘请来了姐夫卡西米尔。他赶到时，玛丽已经苏醒过来，但卡西米尔还是坚持给她做了检查。他一言未发，起身巡视房间里的一切。他问食橱在哪？但玛丽家根本就没这东西。屋子里没有一丝食物的痕迹，只有一包茶能证明玛丽喝过东西。

“你今天吃的什么？”医生问道。

“今天？……我不知道……我中午吃了……”

“吃的什么？”

“樱桃……还有，其他各种东西……”

最后，玛丽不得不坦白从昨天到现在，她只吃了一小捆萝卜和半磅樱桃。她工作到凌晨三点，只睡了四个小时。

医生勃然大怒，看着眼前的这个小傻瓜就气不打一处来，而她一双灰色的大眼睛还闪耀着愉悦的光芒，显得无辜又可怜，更气的是自己竟没发现妻妹在某些方面是这样执拗，容易犯傻。

他板起脸，要求玛丽收拾好一周的生活用品跟他走。他怒火难消，一路上一言不发。回到家，布朗尼娅出去买回牛排，他们要求玛丽就着香醇的肉汁和清脆的土豆片将牛排全部吃掉。不到一周，她就又变回了刚从华沙来时的那个健康女孩。

由于玛丽还有考试要准备，暂时获许回到阁楼，但前提是她必须好好吃饭。不过第二天，她就又开始有了上顿没下顿的凑合生活。

工作！……工作！…… 玛丽感觉自己的大脑在快速成长，双手也变得越来越灵巧。很快，利普曼教授就因为一份独自完成的研究实验而对她颇为赏识，玛丽也赢得了能够展示自己才华和创造力的机会。每天六点，玛丽就穿着粗糙的实验服，站在巴黎大学神圣的物理实验室的橡木桌旁，仔细观察着眼前精密的仪器，注视着某些沸腾着的化学物质。她周围还站着一些同学，大部分都是男性，实验室里一片沉静，因为大家眼前着手在做的事可比闲聊有意思得多。

不过实验结束后，男同学们望向玛丽，有时站在门边同她说上几句话，一个接一个地凑到她身边跟她交个朋友。她也没之前那么冷淡了。有时候男孩们想和她结伴而行的愿望表达得太过强烈，她的好朋友迪都斯卡小姐就不得不用遮阳伞把这些男孩轰走。玛丽根本没时间交朋友。怀着坚定的意志，以追求卓越的狂热和难以想象的执着，她全身心地投入到工作中去。

1893年，她顺利拿到物理学学位，1894年拿到了数学学位，物理学成绩名列榜首，数学成绩屈居第二。同时，她还在努力提高法语水平，想尽办法去掉波兰口音；她想把法语讲得像法国人一样好，只是发 “r”音的时候带一点卷舌，虽然她不是有意为之，但这反而增加了她的独特魅力。

她还会抽空去欣赏巴黎的春景和鲜花。她从未忘却自己是个波兰乡民，属于田间地头。她在乡下过周末，谈论的话题是盛开的丁香花和果树之花，以及充满花香的空气。

当炙热的七月来临时，她又迎来了另一场考试。玛丽很紧张。她和其他三十名学生坐在空气凝重的教室里，她盯着试卷，卷子上的字符在眼前闪烁跳跃。她定了定神，继续答题。玛丽和其他人一起，怀着沉重忐忑的心情等待出成绩的那一天。真到了那天，她溜进半圆形大教室的一角，紧张地等待着宣布结果，在满满一教室的学生和家长中，她显得毫不起眼，确信自己考砸了。

主考官拿着名单走进教室，谈话的嘈杂声和熙熙攘攘的人群瞬间安静了。玛丽根本还没准备好，就听到主考官念出了第一名的名字：

玛丽·斯克沃多夫斯卡。

随后放暑假，玛丽满怀喜悦带着考试结果回到波兰的家中。她还有其他东西一同带回去——给家人的礼物！这次，她可以花光自己的积蓄，是的，花光所有，花光每一分钱。她可以给父亲、给约瑟夫、给海拉买礼物，还要给自己两千公里的旅程准备食物。每个在外的波兰人都要身无一文、满载礼物地回到家乡，这是项不可打破的习俗。

在漫长的暑假里，遍布波兰的亲戚热情地款待了玛丽。不过一直萦绕她心头的问题是：秋天该怎么办？去哪里，怎么赚钱才能支付起自己另一学年一周一镑的生活费？迪都斯卡小姐再次打着她的遮阳伞出现了。没人知道这次她会用遮阳伞赶走谁，但她成功说服了华沙的专家给玛丽授予一项奖学金，理由是玛丽将为这座城市带来荣誉。好消息是，玛丽可以获得六十英镑的亚历山德洛维奇奖学金。这可是一年的学费。她精打细算，尽可能节省。在她能自己挣钱后，她竭力攒钱还上了奖学金，这样其他穷学生就能体味到和她一样的快乐。数年后，奖学金管理处的秘书在收到寄回的钱时大为震惊，之前从未有学生想过要返还奖学金。

她重新开始工作，但这次的工作可不是什么苦差事，而是她毕生所爱、全身心投入的事业。这是她最钟爱的人生环节，她艰难的求学生涯，在贫穷与孤独中奋发向上，带着年轻人的活力与冲劲，做回最真实的自己。她被称为“永远的模范生”——老牌大学古老传说中的那群人：年轻、穷困、渴求知识，相信天降大任于己，并不惜一切代价达成目标。

在旧油灯下辛勤工作的玛丽，深知自己身处一群伟大的科学家之中，人类的辛勤工作者。她没什么生活来源，但却活得十分快乐积极，心无旁骛，简单幸福。寻求真理是她的日常乐趣，这种乐趣偶尔会被一双穿破了的旧鞋破坏。买一双新鞋会花掉她好几周的生活费；她也要为此忍受更多的饥寒交迫。一天晚上，她冻得实在受不了，就把箱子里的衣服都拿出来，盖在床上。但她还是冻得瑟瑟发抖，不过家里除了一把椅子已经没什么能搭在身上了。于是玛丽小心地拖来椅子搭在被子上，一整晚都一动不动，担心用来取暖的旧椅子随时会掉。

水壶里的水放到清晨早就冰凉，但她仍然热爱那时的穷苦生活，甚至写了首纪念的小诗：

求学生活举步维艰

周围青年享乐安逸

享受多么容易，享乐多么常见

独自一人，日复一日

内心坚定，充满欢乐

时光飞逝，逐渐远离

知识与艺术的原野

生活不易

内心常叹阁楼时光

安静工作的场景再次浮现

满满都是人生回忆





第九章　玛丽的爱情故事


玛丽身处困境。这不是第一次，也不会是最后一次。她有项很有趣的科研项目要做，但却没有科研场所。全国工业促进协会请她就不同类型钢铁的磁性进行论文研究。这正是她钟爱的工作。在利普曼教授的实验室里，已经成功进行了大部分实验，但实验室根本没地方放所有需要用的大型仪器。她要分析矿物质和金属样本，她不知道哪儿能租到一楼的实验室。她将自己的困难告诉了一位科学界的波兰朋友柯瓦斯基先生，他碰巧和妻子来巴黎做演讲，顺便度蜜月。

柯瓦斯基认真地望着玛丽。他觉得这件事很重要，不过他一个在巴黎的客居人又能给出什么建议呢。

片刻思索后，他突然喊道：“我有主意了！我还真认识一个在勒蒙大街物理化学学院工作的人，他还算有些能力。他也许能借到实验室，就算借不到也能给点建议。明晚吃完饭来我家喝茶吧。我也会邀请那个年轻人来家中做客。他名声在外，你可能听过他的名字，皮埃尔·居里。”

当玛丽走进柯瓦斯基夫妇寄宿的独栋公寓时，望见了一个个子高高的年轻人正站在阳台窗户的凹处。他看上去十分年轻，这可在玛丽的意料之外，她想自己要见的这位业内名人怎么也该上了年纪。这个年轻人看似普通，却令人印象深刻；看似休闲随意，但举止优雅，这种气质在宽松合体的穿着下愈发突显。两个人互相介绍认识时，他的眼神真挚而纯净，让他看上去十分真诚、简单、年轻。玛丽欣赏他严肃却略带稚气的微笑，他们立刻谈论起了科学，这不就是将两个人牵线到一起的关键因素吗？

皮埃尔的父亲是名医生，他虽然年轻却不同于常人。皮埃尔没上过公立学校，有专门的私人教师。他在家中长大，承欢父母膝下，与哥哥相处融洽。他深受家庭影响而热爱科学，经常陷入沉思，并在日记中写下自己的思考。“女人，”他很年轻的时候就写道，“比男人更加热爱生活：有才华的女人弥足珍贵。当我们专注于某项伟大工作而无法兼顾日常生活时，我们就要和女人们周旋。母亲想要儿子的关爱，尽管这种爱会让儿子变成傻瓜。而陷入爱河的女人甚至会为昙花一现的爱情牺牲掉世界上最伟大的才华。”

这样理解女人的方式虽然有些偏激，但皮埃尔却有自己的理由。他的观察有时确实符合现实，再加上初恋令他饱受痛苦，他决心尘封这段往事并决定终身不婚。但当他与玛丽在阳台上谈论科学的时候，他再次相信命中注定，那时他已三十五岁。在法国国内，他并不知名，甚至被忽视，不过法国经常让伟人们饱尝令人心碎的忽视感，但却并不会削减这些人的伟大。

在法国之外，他已经名扬四海。他和哥哥发现的微量电测量方法已为其他国家的科学家广泛使用，让大家心存感激。他独自发现的晶体对称结构原理，成为现代科学的基础。一种新的天平和一项新的物理规律都以他的名字命名。他和开尔文爵士一样享有盛誉，但他的薪水却仅仅等同于高级技工，一周仅有三镑。

不过，他的一贫如洗也部分归结于自身原因。曾经也有一份收入颇丰的工作摆在他面前，但他的回答是：“不了，谢谢，这类工作简直就是对我精神的最大折磨。”他也被提名政府荣誉奖，但却请求除名，下决心永不接受这些虚名矫饰。

这位坚定决绝的科学狂热者站在玛丽面前侃侃而谈，他修长纤细的手搭在桌上，一双安静清澈的眼睛望向玛丽，透露出一股深邃、平和、超然物外的神情。也许皮埃尔突然记起了他过去所说的名言——“有才华的女人弥足珍贵”。

起初，因为是四人见面，他们之间的谈话较为笼统。随后，皮埃尔和玛丽就谈到了科学。她来此的目的不就是一心为了科学吗？满怀尊重，她认真请教了眼前这个年纪不大却已小有名气的年轻人，仔细倾听了他的建议。后来，皮埃尔一反常态地谈到了自己，讲到了自己的梦想，说到了他在研究并且寻找结晶学的规律，虽然谜团重重但却让人着迷。皮埃尔的脑海中突然闪过一个念头：自己竟然会和一位女性谈起挚爱的工作，各种学科术语和复杂的公式。眼前的这位女性不仅年轻迷人，还对科学充满热忱与浓厚的兴趣，他发现她善于理解，谈论细节问题时很有自己的真知灼见……多么愉快的交谈！他再次望向玛丽，看着她的一头秀发，看着她因化学酸性试剂和家务而变得粗糙的双手，欣赏着她的优雅，欣赏着她撇去浮华与娇柔的一切——多么迷人，拨乱人心弦。这就是那个在波兰工作多年一心想来巴黎的女孩，现在实现了梦想，独自一人、身无分文地在阁楼上勤奋努力。

“你会一直住在巴黎吗？”他问道。

“不，当然不会，” 玛丽回答道，“如果暑假前我顺利通过考试，我就会回到华沙。秋季可能会再回来，但我不知道自己是否能负担得起学费。我可能最后就在波兰的某所学校里面教书了，努力发挥自己的才能。波兰人绝不会背弃自己的祖国。”

两人间的谈话随即又转移到了波兰正在承受的苦难，提到了它的压迫者。皮埃尔，这个先前一心扑在科研上的人听到这样一段人类追求自由的艰难故事，不免感到既吃惊又悲伤。也许是他想到了如果科学家不能一门心思做科研，那会给真理和知识的追寻带来多么惨重的损失。也许是他想到自己要与波兰竞争，为把这个罕见的天才留在巴黎科学界而努力。无论如何，他都不会与玛丽失去联系。他去物理协会听讲就是为了见到玛丽，她经常去那里听新发现。他送给玛丽一本自己限量版的新书。工作时间，他也会时不时到利普曼教授的实验室去看望穿着亚麻衣在仪器设备间忙碌的玛丽。

皮埃尔随后要了玛丽的地址，并来到帝皇大道11号拜访玛丽。他可能因为科学家路易斯·巴斯德曾在这条大街上住过而对此熟知。爬上六层楼，走进小阁楼，这个出身于医生家庭的男子被眼前穷困潦倒的景象深深触动了。不过这与玛丽十分相配！她穿着磨得开了线的毛裙，穿过空荡荡的房间来见皮埃尔，显得分外可爱；身形纤细，朴实无华，热情而又坚毅，她在一无所有的房间中显得愈发光彩照人。

皮埃尔的所有痛楚都烟消云散，就像阳光穿透浓雾。两个人交谈甚欢，皮埃尔于是带着不一样的心情继续投入工作；本来觉得不重要的事情现在也显得尤为重要，愈发明晰。他的新理论被一位著名博士的论文验证，他也在生活中发现了一位不仅没有扼杀反而唤醒男性才华的女士。他现在越发坚信自己的崇高理想，因为他爱上了玛丽。

不过她的心意到底如何呢？皮埃尔还要仔细观察。他带玛丽去了美丽的法国乡间，两个人都热爱乡村生活；他们一起采摘雏菊并带回家，为小阁楼营造了一种简洁优雅的氛围。皮埃尔带玛丽回到了巴黎郊外位于索城的家，见到了自己的母亲和性格开朗的老父亲。玛丽仿佛置身于自己另外一个家，一个和华沙的家极其相似的地方，周围是平易近人、相亲相爱的一家人。他们爱好看书，热爱自然，最重要的是热爱科学。大家谈论起美丽的波兰，讲到玛丽在绵延草原上的漫长穿行，聊到了即将在瑞士群山中度假的欢乐。

“但十月份的时候你会回来的吧？”皮埃尔焦急地问道，他突然紧张起来，“如果你抛弃了科学，那可是大罪过。”

玛丽才不会上当。她知道皮埃尔的意思是若抛弃了他那才是罪过。

然而，波兰仍占据着她的心。她抬起头，略带羞涩地望向皮埃尔说：“我觉得你说得对。我应该还会回来。”

皮埃尔很快就鼓起勇气向玛丽表达了自己的心意，并向她求婚。但玛丽拒绝了。她不可能嫁给一个法国人，从而背弃自己的祖国波兰。他们围绕这一问题展开了很多讨论，皮埃尔知道科学站在自己这边，他坚信没有人有义务为了国家而放弃科学，科学属于整个世界，不能为了一国之利而做出牺牲。

于是，玛丽再次回国度假，除了继续维持朋友关系外，她不能向皮埃尔做出其他任何承诺。皮埃尔给玛丽写了一封又一封长长的劝说信。他想去瑞士待几天看望玛丽，但玛丽要和父亲一起度假，他觉得自己的出现可能会破坏玛丽的美好假期。他写信表达自己的全部思绪和犹豫，并不断渗透自己的想法，认为一个人要终身为之奋斗的梦想就应该是科学。他写道：

在政治领域，你可能永远不知道自己在做什么；也许本意是爱国但实际造成了破坏。想拯救人类，却不知该从何入手。但科学是纯粹的。任何发现，无论多么渺小，一旦出现就会一直存在。一旦发现了真理，它便不会消失，也不会出错。

相信我

爱你的

皮埃尔·居里

玛丽喜欢给他写信表达自己对自由的追求。

“谈论！”他回答道，“我们都是奴隶，感情的奴隶，偏见的奴隶，谋生的奴隶，是机器上的轮子。我们必须向周围环境做出让步。如果让步太多，我们会一无所有；如果让步太少，我们又会被摧毁。”

十月份，玛丽回到了巴黎，固执的不止她一人。皮埃尔说的对周围事物的让步到底是什么？皮埃尔开始思考自己是不是该做出妥协。很快他便将想法付诸实践！他主动提出可以放弃巴黎，奔赴波兰。他愿意暂时放弃科学，教法语谋生，然后再找机会回到科研工作中。

玛丽向布朗尼娅吐露了自己的纠结，并询问她关于皮埃尔要放弃自己国家这个提议的意见。就她自己而言，她觉得一个人根本没权力去要求别人做出如此大的牺牲。但皮埃尔的这个提议确实令她备受感动。皮埃尔也向杜鲁斯基一家征求意见。他们完全站在皮埃尔一边。

布朗尼娅陪着玛丽拜访了皮埃尔的父母，并从他母亲口中得知皮埃尔是个十分优秀且孝顺的儿子，布朗尼娅相信妹妹与他携手定会幸福快乐。

玛丽又纠结了十个多月，然后这两个曾经的不婚者放弃了自己的信条，牵手走向幸福。

玛丽的哥哥从波兰寄了一封热情洋溢、充满理解的信，口吻就好像波兰祖国母亲在告诉她的女儿，嫁给皮埃尔·居里这位法国科学家比回到华沙做一名女教师要有意义得多。事实上，后来发生的事也都表明玛丽的决定是正确的。

于是玛丽可以放心快乐地筹备自己的婚礼了，这是一场不同寻常的婚礼！

1895年7月26日，万里晴空，玛丽·斯克沃多夫斯卡心情亦如阳光般灿烂。她美丽的脸庞上闪烁着幸福的光芒，一头秀发也显得愈发有光泽，穿上了她崭新的海蓝色裙子和卡西米尔·杜鲁斯基的母亲送给她的蓝色条纹衬衫。她并不想穿婚纱；她很高兴自己能有一条新裙子，因为她目前只有一条裙子，而且自己每天都在穿；她喜欢实用的、日后做实验还能穿的衣服。

玛丽梳妆打扮好，皮埃尔接上她一同坐车去火车站，搭火车前往索城，奔赴他们的婚礼。沿着圣米歇尔大道向下，马蹄嘚嘚响，经过巴黎大学时两人相视一笑，眼神中充满爱意——不就是爱将两个人连在了一起吗？

在索城，客人只有布朗尼娅和卡西米尔，斯克沃多夫斯基先生和海拉，他们从华沙远道而来。两个人买不起金戒指，也没钱筹备婚礼早宴。婚礼礼物中，最重要的就是一位堂兄送的两辆崭新的自行车，两个人计划骑着自行车去度蜜月。

婚礼过后，双方的父亲见过两位新人，随后玛丽的父亲对皮埃尔的父亲说：“你可以将玛丽当成女儿来疼爱，她从出生那刻起就没让我伤心失望过。”





第十章　居里夫人


皮埃尔和玛丽开始了一场不同寻常的蜜月之旅。他们没买票也没订房间，打算随心所欲地骑着自行车到处走。两个人在自行车上绑了几件衣服，由于夏天潮热，他们还带了两件长长的防水橡皮雨衣。自行车的轮胎在湿润的道路上静静滚动；所有的法国乡间小道都郁郁葱葱，明亮斑驳的阳光在粗壮的树干上留下点点光影；头顶上方浓密的绿叶在路上留下蛇皮般的阴影，摇曳着上次降雨时的雨滴，洒落在行人身上。

两个人单独在一起的旅程多么美妙！他们不去想何时结束，也不知旅程中还有多少惊喜，也不知道路的尽头在哪里，更不去忧愁今晚要寄宿何处。

皮埃尔一直喜欢在寂静的森林里漫步。他喜欢树林凉爽湿润的感觉，来到岩石遍布的山坡时，他也喜欢丛生的迷迭香、小叶薄荷和野蔷薇。无论漫步在白天黑夜，还是清晨黄昏；不管是十一点或三点，还是七点或十点吃饭，对他来说都无所谓。而现在，一切变得更加美好，因为玛丽陪伴着他，也绝不催促和打扰。

两个人一点都不铺张浪费，所以也不住酒店。晚上到了村庄，找到一间简陋的小旅馆，里面有一个大大的酒吧，摆着几张桌子、很多把椅子。店家给他们铺上一张洁白的桌布，端上稠稠的热汤。吃过晚饭，两个人爬上吱吱作响的木楼梯，穿过杂乱的走廊，来到一间烛光微弱、昏暗不清的房间。法国的乡间旅馆一般都是这样，晚餐丰盛，床褥整洁舒适，而且花费不高。

第二天吃过面包卷，喝过咖啡，他们骑着自行车穿过另一条树荫密布、两旁树木丛生的小路。两个人满怀期待，沿着绿荫小道，经过长长的骑行来到了神秘的树林深处；将车停放在路边的村舍里；一定要检查好指南针，因为在法国广阔的森林里很容易迷失方向；口袋里揣满苹果，双脚踩着柔软的苔藓，陷在泥泞的土里。多有意思！他们早把方向、时间抛在脑后，没人知道他们什么时候会返回。

皮埃尔走在前面，随心所欲地大步向前。玛丽跟在后面，步伐较慢，但步调一致。玛丽没戴帽子，在当时的社会，女性散步一般都会戴帽子。这不是她有意要制造的潮流。她本应着拖地的长裙，因为裙摆上沾着的小泥块弄脏了鞋子，于是便将裙子高高挽起，露出了优美的脚踝。她的鞋子虽厚实但灵巧，皮带上的口袋里装着小刀、钱和手表。尽管皮埃尔在前面走得很快，就像要去赶火车，但他说的话玛丽听得一清二楚。虽然他在同玛丽说话，但他没回过头，他可能是对着树木在高谈自己的晶体研究。没什么比晶体研究的话题，或者专业来说是结晶学研究，更高深难懂但令人受益匪浅。玛丽欢快地倾听着，她的回答、评论和建议的精彩程度丝毫不亚于皮埃尔，两个人简直就是英雄所见略同。

玛丽开始感到疲倦，忽然就走到了森林深处一处开阔的空地，空地上有一湾芦苇丛生的湖泊。玛丽躺在岸边享受阳光浴，皮埃尔像孩子般前去打猎，看看湖泊里有什么好玩儿的：蜻蜓、蝾螈和火蜥蜴。湖水深处还漂浮着睡莲；湖水近处，盛开着黄色的鸢尾花。他想采点花打扮玛丽，但苦于没船。远处一棵树倒在湖面上——可能有点滑，不过面对爱人，滑点又算什么？皮埃尔运气很好，他很快就采回鲜花，用沾着水滴的莲花和鸢尾花编了一个花环戴在新婚妻子的头上。

突然，他四肢匍匐静悄悄地趴在近水处，好似看到了猎物。玛丽并没在意，在烈日炎炎的八月，能静静地坐着，什么都不做，别提多舒服了。突然她尖叫一声，恐惧地望着自己的手掌。一只凉冰冰、湿漉漉的青蛙正蹲在那里。

“你不喜欢青蛙吗？”皮埃尔吃惊地问道。他很喜欢青蛙。

“不讨厌，但不能在我手里呀。”

“好可惜！它们这么可爱。快看，它长得多帅气。”

不过他还是把帅气的青蛙先生送回了湖中，不让它破坏了两个人的欢乐休憩。

两个人继续边走边聊，玛丽一直戴着那顶别致的花环，直到重新回到公路上，骑上自行车。

八月中旬，他们已经骑车沿着林间道路环游了巴黎，随后来到了巴黎以北的尚蒂伊，一座掩映在丛林里的小镇，如今各家的马厩里都圈养着赛马。玛丽和皮埃尔要在森林里的一座名为拉比什或称为雌鹿的农场和家人碰面。在那里，他们顺利见到了布朗尼娅、卡西米尔和小依莲，大家也叫她露，另外还有祖母杜鲁斯卡、斯克沃多夫斯基先生和海拉。

森林深处的农场有自己独特的美。四周静悄悄的，只能听到几声狗吠，树干折断的嘎吱声，远处伐木工锯木的吱吱声，受惊了的野鸡扇动翅膀的簇簇声，还有野兔在草丛中穿梭的窸窣声。在人们足迹可达或目光可至的地方，到处都闪耀着五月的明媚，整个大地都覆盖了一层山谷百合泛黄飘落的叶子。

他们在农场里畅谈，经常还带着只有三岁的露。小孩长得漂亮可爱，天真而充满童趣。有时他们会同斯克沃多夫斯基先生探讨神圣的科学，分享抚养孩子的心得。有时他们还会同皮埃尔的父母聊一聊医学和政治，老人家专门从索城赶来度假。法国是片言论自由的土地，玛丽经常听到她的法国公公同朋友们大谈政治，情绪激昂，言论自由得让她吃惊。政治就是他们的生活；他们密切关注国家治理，在自由的法国随性地表达自己的想法，这也让谈话充满乐趣。但皮埃尔不同。他不喜欢政治，因为愤怒会让人失去理智。不过当政治出现不公或残忍的一面，他也会表达自己的立场——站在受压迫、被迫害的人的一边。

蜜月结束，皮埃尔和玛丽在巴黎找了一间公寓开始了自己的小生活，不过他们的家居生活可不同寻常！没有来客，于是家里就只放了两把椅子。如果有不请自来的客人不辞辛劳爬上四层楼，也只能看到这对小夫妻在埋头工作，环顾四周想找个地方落脚，都不用别人开口，自己就会发现根本无处可坐。不过最难做的还是要以委婉的方式拒绝来客。皮埃尔夫妇根本没有时间享受娱乐。任何时候，玛丽都要一人分饰两角：妻子的工作，相信天下大多的贤妻都深有体会；科学家的事业，相信大部分科学家都感触颇深。

玛丽决心将家布置得很简单，越不费时打理越好。没有毯子需要掸，没有扶手椅或沙发需要刷，墙上什么也没挂不需要掸灰，也没什么摆设需要擦亮。一张桌子、两把椅子、书架，木质坚实，打理不费事。房间布置简单，花瓶中插着一束鲜花，为室内增添了些许芬芳，而书籍、油灯和一摞关于物理的文件显示出这是一间学者的卧房。两个相爱的人，同时崇尚自然和求知，心无旁骛。不过他们还要养家糊口。这无疑占用了科研时间，令人遗憾，不过玛丽这次无法再忽视生活的现实。

为了好好打理家务，她首先买了一本黑色封皮、印着记账本三个金字的笔记本。她深知准确无误的精打细算是幸福家庭的重要基础，对一个每年只有240镑生活费的家庭来说更显得尤为重要。

她的厨艺也容不得些许差错，否则皮埃尔就会出现消化问题。此外，玛丽还要找些小窍门，这样晚餐就能简单易做，她可以把更多的时间花在科学实验上。现实残酷、不容改变，但聪明的大脑可以反其道而行。第一点就是延长工作时间。她一大早就起床去菜市场，回到家再整理床铺、扫地、准备晚餐。哎，又是做饭！结婚前，布朗尼娅和杜鲁斯卡夫人都给她培训过厨艺，不过人从课堂上总学不到什么东西，犯错其实是最好的老师。好在皮埃尔并不知道他吃的是什么，无论饭做得好坏他都吃得一样开心，但玛丽不能忍受她的法国婆婆——一个来自著名美食国度的女人——认为波兰女孩根本不懂厨艺。于是，玛丽一遍遍地研究菜谱，像研究科学一样认真；在食谱的空白处记笔记，并详细记录每一次的失败与成功。不过还有一些是菜谱上学不到的东西。煮牛肉是要用热水还是凉水？怎样把一根根粘在一起的通心粉分离开来？这些都需要科学实验一一解答。一点一点，玛丽的厨艺愈加精湛，她研究的菜肴可以在她外出时留在炉火上慢炖；她精确地研究出了不同菜肴熬炖的时间和相应的火苗高度，设置好燃炉，她便可以离开家去实验室工作八小时。谁说科学知识对厨艺毫无帮助！

晚上在和皮埃尔回家的路上，玛丽就买好了蔬菜或水果。回到家吃过晚饭，收拾完家务，记好账单，她拿出学位学习的书籍，一直学到深夜两点。从早六点到深夜两点，这真是漫长的一天。不过她还能抽出点时间给哥哥写信：“我们一切安好——身体健康，生活愉快。家里慢慢布置得和我理想中的一样，但我一直坚持简约风格，不用费时费力维护，因为我真是没什么帮手。小时工每天来一小时帮忙做些清洗工作，解决家务活儿中最麻烦的部分。”

夫妻二人没有任何娱乐活动。他们经常去索城看望皮埃尔的父母，同时也带着自己的工作，家里专门腾出两间房让他们专心搞科研。夫妻俩几乎没怎么去过剧院，别的活动那就更不用说了。两个人甚至都没钱去参加海拉在华沙举办的婚礼。他们一年到头都全心工作，只在复活节放几天假，就这样持续到八月份，而玛丽又迎来了期末大考。

她又一次稳居榜首。皮埃尔骄傲地搂着她的脖子一同回家。一回到家，就给自行车打好气，将背包塞满，骑车前往奥弗涅山脉。

玛丽记录下了那个美妙的假期：“阳光明媚的假期，多么美好的回忆。经过一段漫长艰难的爬行，我们穿过了奥布拉森嫩绿的草原，尽情呼吸高原上的新鲜空气。另一段鲜活的回忆就是在特吕耶尔峡谷欣赏黄昏的美景，爬上峡谷好似人在画中游，从溪流下方的船上远远传来了吟唱的曲调。我们计算错了路程，无法在黎明前返回旅店。随后遇到了一队马车，马匹因为我们的自行车受到了惊吓，迫使我们不得不横穿农田。回到大路上时，整个高原沐浴在朦胧的月光中，夜晚被赶进棚的牛一只只从暗处缓缓踱出来，目光温和的大眼睛望向我们。”

假期结束又回到工作当中，生活继续用它的艰辛不易磨砺着玛丽·居里，就像曾经调教玛丽·斯克沃多夫斯卡那样，唯有辛苦付出才能收获世间最美好的事物。

玛丽像渴求科学一样渴望孩子，更愿意与皮埃尔分享一切。但这次她发现自己根本无法做完所有事。她不能再一站就是八小时地来研究钢的磁性，她不能和皮埃尔骑着自行车在布列塔尼的蓝色海湾畅玩。她惊讶地发现自己竟然要向某些事情做出妥协。玛丽的父亲特意从波兰赶来看望她，好让她早点儿休假。皮埃尔用简单的波兰语给她写信，虽然他觉得波兰语很难，但还是为自己的进步感到骄傲。

“我的宝贝，亲爱的小甜心，我人生的挚爱。今天收到你的来信，我很开心。没什么特别的，除了我还是一如既往地想你；我的心早已飞去与你同在。”玛丽用尽可能简单的语言回信说道：“天气很好。阳光明媚。温度较高。没有你在身边，我很忧伤。快回来吧。我从早坐到晚等你回来，但却不见你的踪影。我很好。我尽力工作，但庞加莱的书比我想象的要难。我必须和你谈谈，我们要一起探讨一下难点。”

艾琳的到来增添了玛丽的欢乐以及工作量。这是她的小公主，要喂她吃饭，给她洗澡、穿衣服，如果不是医生强烈要求，她肯定不会让保姆帮忙。

如今，玛丽的时间被四件事情占据：实验室、丈夫、家和女儿。她想工作时，艾琳就咬紧牙，哭得撕心裂肺；或者艾琳得了感冒，磕到了头。两位伟大的科学家，已经为人父母，整夜照看着这个蓝眼睛的小家伙。有时，即便艾琳一切安好，玛丽在实验室忙于科学研究，也会突然心里一惊，留下手旁的报告，冲到花园里看看保姆有没有照顾好孩子。没事！保姆推着婴儿车，艾琳稳稳地坐在车里。保姆不在的时候，艾琳有外公这个忠诚的护卫，玛丽把孩子交给父亲就十分放心，可以转身去忙实验室里的事儿。

但没人注意到艾琳的妈妈越来越瘦了。不过玛丽很幸运，消瘦的身材让她愈发美丽，有一种高贵轻盈的美。她简直像纸片人，弱不禁风，不过额头仍然高挺，眼神还是柔和而深邃。





第十一章　伟大的发现


玛丽同其他杰出的科学研究者一样，在实验室里辛勤工作。她拥有双硕士学位和研究员的职位，发表了一篇关于回火钢磁性的论文。她未来还会获得诸多学者梦寐以求的博士学位。要想获得博士学位，就需要发现未知，解决尚无答案的难题。还有许多悬而未决的难题，有些甚至都没有答案。有人终其一生都在努力奋斗，最后却发现自己付出的时间和生命都已付诸东流，一无所获。莎士比亚说，大自然有一种“神秘未知”的力量。不过在一切未知的事物中，玛丽会去探索什么呢？

皮埃尔是玛丽实验室的主任。她会听取皮埃尔的意见，毕竟他是位学识渊博、经验丰富的物理学家。他的建议常常中肯务实，能够帮助人类探索未知、引发新知。有没有什么无知阻挡了人们探索知识的道路？两个人经常聊到这个话题。一天，翻开记载着最新发现的科学杂志，玛丽在看到亨利·贝可勒尔的研究文献时稍作停留，早在一年前他们第一次读到这篇文章时就充满兴趣。她又读了一遍。仔仔细细地读了一遍。

自身发光的物质！不从太阳或其他星球吸收光就能自己发光的物质！有意思吧？玛丽对此非常感兴趣。

德国物理学家威廉·伦琴最近新发现了X射线，医生可运用这一技术透过病患皮肤来观察皮下组织。随后法国数学家庞加莱提出疑问，思索是否还存在其他类似于X射线的、某些在光感下会释放射线的发光体。这一疑问引起了法国科学家贝克勒尔的浓厚兴趣，他假设存在这种射线，并开始研究某些特定物质，看是否能找到相似的射线。在研究稀有金属铀时，他有了新的令人惊讶的发现：铀盐不需要光照就能释放射线，它们是自动发光体。之前从未有人发现这种物质，没人能理解或解释清楚这种射线。贝克勒尔了解它的某些特质：例如，将铀化合物放在胶片上并覆盖上黑纸，它能透过纸张影印照片，并能利用周围空气使验电器放电。多么奇妙的射线！

贝克勒尔的发现印证了这种特殊射线的存在。玛丽决定解读其背后的原理，这将会成为她博士论文的研究课题。物质本身也许微小到毫不起眼，但丝毫不影响她探究的决心。她要找出射线的由来、起源和形成原因，也就是去探究其本质，简单说来就是去研究它是什么。探求一件事物的本质就是解读它的过程。

没有什么书目可以参考，唯有贝克勒尔的论文，但文章对该问题也没有深入研究。玛丽要研究的这一物质，世界上无人知晓，也就没有老师可以传授知识。她其实是冒着很大的风险在探究未知的世界。

但就像冒险家要想深入巴西雨林的神秘世界则离不开船只载他渡过亚马孙河一样，玛丽需要一间房来开展实验。找到这样一间实验室可不容易。皮埃尔跟朋友打听个遍，但谁也想不出哪里还能腾出这样一间空房。物理研究院主任建议，也许一层那间旧储藏室可以。储藏室里布满了蜘蛛网，胡乱堆放着仪器和备用品，不过这也算是一个房间。

在那凌乱的拐角间里，玛丽安顿好了自己。条件艰苦对她来说根本不是什么新鲜事儿，她也早就适应了。冬天，要忍受零上6度的寒冷。她自己倒是无所谓，但那些精密的仪器就显得比她更为敏感，在恶劣的自然条件下很容易产生误差。四周墙壁上渗出的潮气使仪器无法正常工作，它们需要的是恒温条件。静电计是极其敏感的仪器。玛丽必须考虑到所有仪器的敏感度，并据此来计算误差。

就这样，玛丽开始研究铀的放射线。她首要做的就是测量一定量的放射线。她要弄懂这种射线使空气导电的能力到底有多强，又需要多久才能让验电器释放掉所有电荷。



玛丽使用的验电器是一个两边带孔的金属箱。箱内垂挂的铜片B与箱盖里侧的硫黄SS相接——硫黄是极好的绝缘体。一条水平的电线与铜片B相交，一头连接球C，一头连接电容器P'。和铜片B相连的还有金片L。整个金属箱接地。给验电器通电，将检测物放在电容器托盘P上，并与金属箱外侧相接。检测物会使托盘P与P'之间的空气带电，这样验电器带的电荷就会逐渐流失。伴随着这一过程，金片L就会逐步回落。

玛丽用显微镜透过金属箱上的小孔观察实验的整个过程。金片回落的时间与射线的强度成正比。几周后，她便愈加笃信，铀的放射性——射线强度——与托盘P上检测物中的纯铀量成正比，并不受检测物中化学成分、光照、温度或外界因素的影响。所以说，这种放射性是一种非常独立的属性。不过它到底是什么呢？

如果仅研究铀，则她对放射性的探究不会再有进展。她想，也许这种微小独立的属性还存在于铀以外的其他元素中？虽然还未曾有人发现，但这并不意味着不会有人发现。玛丽能发现，只不过需要时间。她决定开始研究所有已知的化学物质。这需要多大的勇气啊！那可是所有已知的化学物质！

况且，除了要研究每种已知的化学物质之外，还要照顾丈夫、照看家，还有女儿，需要为她穿衣打扮，精心喂养，陪她玩耍、认知世界。但玛丽·居里一心只知道工作。她的脑海中突然闪过一个推测，这个推测在任何人脑海中都可能闪现但事实上却没有，即如果铀自己本身能够发光，那么在浩瀚的宇宙中，肯定还有其他物质也能自己发光。

的确存在其他物质。玛丽发现了另一物质钍。随后她也将这种能自身发光的属性命名为放射性。

于是她测试了所有已知的化学物质，这些物质按照无数种组合方式和比例进行搭配，构成了我们的大千世界。但仅有两种具有放射性，为什么呢？这种神秘而奇特的力量背后到底是什么？她目前离答案还远，那么在测试完所有已知的化学物质之后还能做些什么呢？

世界上一切应有尽有，包括前人的研究文献。玛丽的好奇心很强。她决定去博物馆开始研究矿物质。那些包含铀或钍的物质就具有放射性，当然不含有这两种元素的物质也可能存在放射性。前人记录了矿物质的具体构成，玛丽只需要翻看以前的记录，从有可能性的物质——含铀或钍的矿物质——着手。

当发现放射性矿物质时，玛丽就会测量其中铀元素、钍元素的含量以及物质的整体放射强度。一加一等于二，但这两种元素加起来相当于八！！！

她实验用的矿物质其放射性比其中的铀与钍加起来都要强。但玛丽觉得不可能。她要重新进行实验，肯定是实验过程出现了偏差。

如果真是有差错，那她肯定又犯了一遍，因为这次仍然得出了同样的结果。一次又一次……一次又一次……她又做了整整二十遍实验，但结果完全一样。

那就只有一个解释：矿物质中肯定含有微量且难以察觉的一种未知物，且其放射性远强于铀或钍。

1898年，人类世界中的未知物质终于浮出水面。玛丽对布朗尼娅说：“这种暂时无法解释的射线来源于一种未知的元素……的确存在，只待发现！皮埃尔和我都证实了这种物质的存在，但当我们向其他科学家言明此事时，他们都认为是我们的实验出了差错，建议我们小心求证。但我坚信自己并没有疏忽。”

玛丽极其兴奋，一心探求那未知物的本质。她曾写道：“生活本不易——但那有何干？我们必须坚持不懈，并对自己充满信心。我们要坚信上天赋予的能力必将有其所用。我们要向着目标不断努力前行，不论付出何种代价。”

1898年4月12日，玛丽·居里正式发表声明：“沥青铀矿和铜铀云母的放射性要远强于铀本身。事实明晰，并印证了这些矿物质肯定含有比铀放射性更强的元素……”

她确信这种新元素的存在，但需要眼见为实，需要将它展示在世人面前。皮埃尔·居里当时对玛丽的工作产生了浓厚的兴趣，也一直参与讨论，将自己的工作暂搁一边，开始和妻子并肩作战，要将这隐秘的元素公之于世。两个伟大的头脑再加上两双勤劳的双手就要与这个不易察觉的元素展开博弈。玛丽已经证实这种元素的存在，这是她对科学的贡献。而在随后的工作中，两个人要共同分担、共同贡献。

他们研究沥青铀矿，因为它的总放射强度是所含铀放射强度的四倍。然而，沥青铀矿中所有的其他元素都为科学家所知。所以这种未知元素的含量一定微乎其微，才逃过了严谨的科学家的法眼。两个人猜想这种元素可能只占沥青铀矿元素比的百分之一。如果在一开始他们猜测到这一含量是百万分之一，那又会做何感想呢？

他们将沥青铀矿分解到元素，开始测量每种独立元素的放射性。随着工作的有序开展，他们发现，沥青铀矿石中明显存在的未知放射性元素原来有两种。1898年7月，他们先发现了其中一种。

“应该由你来命名。”皮埃尔对玛丽说。

玛丽思绪万千。这一发现定会全球闻名，并被各个国家记录，因此玛丽要以她备受压迫的祖国波兰来命名新元素。残暴的压迫者应该知道波兰也能为世界献礼。她在皮埃尔耳边低声说道：“钋。”

随后玛丽回到家做了果酱，给女儿洗澡换衣，在日记中记录下孩子的体重，记录她在磨乳牙，孩子已经会用手势表达“谢谢”，并且能咿咿呀呀地说“快，快，走”。

又到了休假时间。钋和另一个未知元素被留在了潮湿的实验室里，两位科学家带着孩子和自行车搭火车前往奥弗涅高山。小镇上分布着各式教堂，形状奇特的小山尖上坐落着古老的小教堂，两个人沿着死火山漫步，边走边谈论着另一个未知元素，还没有人见过它的庐山真面目。他们站在克莱蒙特望向平缓的山丘，法国的民族英雄韦辛格托里克斯让战无不胜的恺撒饱尝了战败的苦涩。他们走进小镇，骑士统帅贝特朗·杜·盖克兰就长眠于此，他让法国第一次觉得自己是个完整的国家。他们站在山上俯瞰一条被称作“锡路”的古道，腓尼基人就是沿着这条路将锡从未开化的英国运送到文明的东部。过去的历史仿若再现于眼前与心间，就像一颗不安分的星，闪烁着未知事物的光芒，这种事物仍如谜团般有待解开。

秋天，居里一家三口重新开始工作：艾琳开始长牙，并开始蹒跚学步，而不再是靠四肢乱爬；艾琳的父母又一次开始在潮湿的实验室里寻找另一个未知的元素。

1898年12月26日，在给科学院的一份论文里，他们平静地宣布：“新的放射性物质中还有一种新元素，我们决心命名为镭……镭的放射性不可估量。”





第十二章　黑暗中的一丝光亮


于是，这个神秘的放射性未知物有了名字，却没人见过它的面目，甚至包括为它取名为镭的皮埃尔和玛丽。它不像其他珍贵且真切的物质，可以触摸，可以看见，能放在瓶中，甚至能称重。称重这一问题很重要。重量——“原子量”——对科学家来说就是元素存在的最好证明。皮埃尔和玛丽心里很清楚，连他们自己都不知道原子量的物质，从科学家的角度来审视则相当于根本不存在。不能这样，皮埃尔和玛丽一定要找到镭，并进行称重。只有这样做才能让科学家们相信它的存在。

“它存在于沥青铀矿中，”居里夫妇想道，“微乎其微，肉眼难见；但如果能从足够多的沥青铀矿中提炼出所有的镭，也许这个体量肉眼就可见了。”

但如何才能得到足够多的沥青铀矿，比如上百吨？得到了又该放在哪里呢？即便有地方存放，又该怎样开展工作呢？

两位科学家准备一步一步来。首先要找到沥青铀矿。他们知道在哪能找到大量铀矿，因为波希米亚人用沥青铀矿来制作精美的玻璃品；但价格昂贵，居里夫妇甚至连谈论它的资本都没有。当然波希米亚人并不是用沥青铀矿本身来制作玻璃，他们从中提炼出铀来生产玻璃，将大量的废渣堆弃在圣约阿希姆斯塔尔的丛林里。“镭和钋，”居里夫妇说，“不在铀里，那就肯定在废渣里。也许我们能劝服生产商将废渣廉价卖给我们。”

“卖？”生产商和善地说，“如果你们自己付运费的话，就直接送给你们。”即便是运费也已经很高昂了，但居里夫妇倾其所有，将运费送到了波希米亚。

问题解决了。废渣很快就会送到，装了整整几节火车车厢。不过到底能放在哪儿呢？

皮埃尔和玛丽来到了科学的殿堂——巴黎大学。在那一幢幢教学楼里，肯定有废弃的房间能让他们存放价值丰富，被寄予厚望的废渣吧。但事实上根本没有！他们不得已又来到了物理学院，即便在这儿也没寻找到任何满意的地方。唯一能提供的地方就是实验室院落里另一侧的棚屋。真的只是棚屋！玻璃屋顶已经破碎，雨天会漏雨，而他们的实验却一定要保持周围环境的干燥。没有铺地板，只有用焦油刷的粗糙地面；没有家具，除了一两张旧餐桌、一面黑板、旧炉子和锈迹斑斑的铁皮烟囱。夏天，这两位辛勤工作的科学家将会像要被煮熟了一样，因为屋顶是全玻璃的。冬天，外面天寒地冻，他们在屋里会被冻得瑟瑟发抖，因为炉子没有任何热度；雨天，他们又会被雨水浇个透。这都不算什么，由于房间没法装排烟器，不能排出有毒气体，于是他们的大部分工作都要在户外进行。就像那句古老的格言：“乞丐没有选择权。”居里夫妇还是决定在棚屋里开展实验。

在那个伟大的早晨，负重的黑色马匹伴着响铃，驮着煤箱，停在了物理学院的门外。这对盼望已久的夫妇连帽子都顾不得戴，穿着实验服就冲了出来，欢呼雀跃地迎接自己的货物。运送到的可不单单是煤。

其实，运到的货物不是煤，是一袋袋的褐色废渣。玛丽等不及将麻袋搬进实验室，就激动地在大街上，在马儿庄重的目光中，解开了捆绑在麻袋上的细绳。这可是沥青铀矿呀！她的沥青铀矿！或者说是沥青铀矿中那重要的一部分。她心中、眼中还有轻轻跃动的指尖上，无不透露出强烈的好奇。终于，她能将双手伸入这堆棕黄色的废渣中，其中还混杂着波希米亚松树林的松针。镭，这种放射性极强的神秘物质真的存在其中吗？玛丽定要一探究竟，即便她要提炼小山堆般的废渣。

首批几吨的废渣运进了棚屋中，开始实验研究，持续进行了整整四年，这是玛丽人生中最美好也最艰难的日子。

她用一口巨大的铁锅来提炼废渣，并用和自己身高差不多的铁棒不断搅拌。她一整天都沉浸在自己的工作中，为了不影响工作进度甚至吃喝都在棚屋里。几乎每天都能看到这样的玛丽：她的头发在风中飘扬，脏兮兮的实验服上溅满了污点和酸液，不断搅拌着暂无一丝希望的废渣。她选择了最费劲儿的户外体力劳动，而皮埃尔则坐在棚屋里的桌旁进行着精密的实验，研究镭的属性。有时候，玛丽能一次性提炼四十磅以上的废渣，在棚屋里摆满了盛着沉淀物和液体的器皿。她经常搬重物，将一个器皿中的沉淀物倒入另一个当中，不断搅拌着那口沸腾着的大铁锅。

结束了一整天繁重的工作之后，玛丽回到家还要照看孩子。她给艾琳洗完澡，把她抱上床，希望能哄她快快入睡，这样就能回到书房和皮埃尔一起进行研究。但艾琳可不这样想。只要玛丽一转过身，背后就会传出一句哀怜的“妈妈”……于是玛丽就要回到艾琳的床边坐下，直到她入睡。皮埃尔对此有些不满，他也想要玛丽多花些时间在实验研究上。不过当艾琳熟睡之后，这对夫妻就又能坐在一起，研究至深夜。

第二天又是一天的工作。镭元素到底在哪？他们永远都看不到了吗？日子一天天变长成月，月数超过十二成年，第二年又悄悄流逝到了第三年，第三年又交替为第四年。他们就像在梦中工作，心中唯念一件事，嘴上只谈一件事。“真找到了镭，它会是什么样的呢？”一天，玛丽和皮埃尔抽空在院中散步时忽然说到。

“我希望它颜色美丽。”皮埃尔回答道。

1900年，法国化学家安德鲁·德比尔纳前来帮助他们共同研究，但在找到镭或钋之前，先发现了一个“兄弟”元素，命名为锕。

时光飞逝，马车运来了更多吨沥青铀矿的废渣。每天带着极强的耐心，玛丽从中提炼出镭纯度越来越高的物质。不过仍不见镭的踪影，它仍然掩藏着自己，保持着自己的神秘性。

玛丽仍然维持着极大的耐心，但困难重重。她和皮埃尔的钱不够生活，两个人也没有足够的时间工作。皮埃尔还要花大量的时间教学来赚取那维持生计的二百四十镑，这也占用了他研究镭元素的时间，而且收入还远不能维持他们的日常开销和艾琳的养护费用。于是皮埃尔决定在大学里谋个职位，这样他的工作能更加高端，收入也会更加可观。也许他还能拥有一间真正意义上的实验室，电力足够进行实验，白天不用上那么多课，晚上也不用批改那么多无聊的作业。

但不幸的是，职位并不总是给那些科研能力强的人，而是经常落到了院长朋友或那些懂得如何夸耀自己的人的囊中。好不容易等来了能申请职位的机会，皮埃尔又被告知要按照习俗前去拜访每一位任命委员会的成员。他讨厌这种行为。他羞涩地按响门铃，请求面见委员会成员，走进成员家中坐下。但当成员进来时，皮埃尔由于过于窘迫，便开始用溢美之词对自己的竞争对手大加赞赏。于是到了职位任命公布的那一天，他的竞争对手自然顺利受聘。

但总要做点事情谋生。皮埃尔在法国工业大学——法国最著名的两所高校之一——谋得了一份教师的工作。职位虽有些低微，但一年能额外增加一百镑的收入。

与此同时，日内瓦大学也给了他一份心仪的工作，大学讲师的头衔、理想的实验室，且配备有他要求的所有仪器。他接受了这一职位，和玛丽来到了日内瓦。但到了之后，他们更明白自己无法割舍下巴黎，更是不能抛下镭元素，它就像是两个人的孩子。不论巴黎如何对待他们，他们唯有在巴黎才能进行镭元素的研究。于是带着满满的歉意，皮埃尔还是拒绝了日内瓦大学的心仪工作，回到了巴黎，再次陷入贫穷，但也重新投身到了镭元素的研究工作当中。

不过令人开心的是，皮埃尔在物理化学自然科学院找到了一份工作，玛丽也开始在塞夫勒培训学校给女孩们上初级教师培训课。这些女孩能有玛丽·居里当老师，别提多幸运了。但遗憾的是，世界没有意识到，成千上万的人都能在塞夫勒教学，而玛丽从事的镭研究工作却仅有她本人才能完成。玛丽用心备课，获得了不少赞誉，这是学生们上过的最原创也最动听的课程。但一周几次的交通往返，备课和批改作业，也浪费了她不少宝贵的时间。这就像是让荷兰著名画家伦勃朗去画门柱一样。皮埃尔和玛丽已经筋疲力尽。他们还能见到镭吗？

玛丽也早都将她要在婚后善待身体的誓言抛在脑后。“你们俩都不好好吃饭，”医生在给皮埃尔的信中写道，“我不止一次看到居里夫人就着一杯茶，只啃了两根细细的香肠。再强健的体魄也不能天天挨饿呀……我知道你的理由，‘她那是不饿，她是个成年人，知道什么对自己有益。’其实才不是。她就像个孩子。我必须站在朋友的角度告诉你们，要多花些时间享受食物……不要边看书边吃东西，或探讨物理……”

不过，无论是皮埃尔还是玛丽都没将医生的叮嘱放在心上。他们要在勒蒙街的这间棚屋里将镭元素公之于世，没有什么比这更重要。

某段时间，皮埃尔建议应该把时间投入镭元素属性的研究上，暂时搁置寻找这种物质，但玛丽并不同意。

她其实越来越接近了。她不再提炼粗糙的废渣。她已经提炼出了一种能放在室内的物质，且蕴含着几十吨废渣中的所有镭元素。要想进一步研究，还需要精密的仪器，并在一间无灰尘也无湿气、既不冷也不热的科学实验室中展开，不要有任何因素影响到实验的准确性。但玛丽根本没有这样一间实验室，灰尘、酷暑、严寒和风不断破坏她的实验结果，迫使她浪费时间和精力进行重复实验。她的忍耐力真是惊人。

1902年，距离玛丽宣布可能存在镭元素的时间，已经过去了三年零九个月。她最终还是战胜了这个放射性元素。她在残渣中找到了遗珠，她看见了镭。她提炼出了整整一分克的镭。它有重量，原子量为226。化学家们纷纷向此致敬。

晚上，玛丽和皮埃尔坐在家中，艾琳已经熟睡。这个四岁的小魔王终于妥协，同意闭上眼睛，让妈妈回到爸爸身边去给她缝制新裙子，艾琳所有的衣服都是玛丽亲手做的。玛丽突然放下手中的活儿，说：“我们再回去看看！”

皮埃尔无须多问。他们才与镭元素分别两小时，但就迫不及待地想要再见到它。他们对它仿若对待新生儿般眷恋。他们告诉父亲要出去一趟，便手挽着手穿过熙熙攘攘的街道，经过破旧的街区工厂，回到了勒蒙街，走进了那间棚屋。

“别开灯，”玛丽说，“你还记得曾说过期望镭能有一个漂亮的颜色吗？”

在黑暗的棚屋中，镭元素不仅显现了自身的颜色，更重要的是它还能发光！

“看呀！快看！”玛丽低声说，她走到椅子前，坐下仔细观察。

黑暗的房间中闪烁着星点亮光，仿若蓝白色的月光在水面上跳跃，星星点点的亮光在黑暗中闪烁。在桌面的架子上，这些奇妙神秘的光亮不停跳动。终于，镭元素在小容器中现身，用黑暗中的一丝光亮证明了自己的存在。





第十三章　不申请专利销售


整个世界都为之亢奋！一种全新的事物进入了人们的日常生活，改变了他们对许多事物的认知。不仅科学家们在谈论镭，孩子们在放学回家的路上也在谈论，女性，在因男性包揽了所有伟大发现而沉默了几个世纪后，终于可以大肆欢庆，因为有位女科学家发现了全新的未知事物。不过一开始，根本没人能料想到镭的真正价值。

英国、丹麦、德国和奥地利的著名学者纷纷开始给居里夫妇写信，想要了解这一项新发现的具体信息。世界各地的科学家也都开始着手研究镭，发现了该元素的更多属性，找到了更多的同类元素。两位英国的科学家威廉·拉姆赛和弗雷德里克·索迪发现这种新元素自身能释放出一种微量的未知气体，将之命名为氦。换言之，镭能变成氦。这一发现令人震惊。科学家习惯于嘲笑那些鼓吹自己能点铁成金的中世纪炼金术士。炼金术士那冒着青烟的神秘炼炉勾勒出了一幅白日做梦的图景，而科学家认为物质本身就由其化学成分和原子量决定。但如今他们面临的事实是镭元素本身产生了氦，于是他们开始思索，其他新物质中又会蕴藏着哪些元素。现在看来，该轮到炼金术士的在天之灵来嘲笑化学家们了。

不论何时，点铁成金的这种技能都无法与镭元素具有的特别能力相提并论。它看上去就像普通的食盐，但其放射性却是铀的两百万倍。除了金属铅，它的射线能穿透任何坚硬的金属。但它也有自身的缺陷——该元素如此活跃，即便是放在玻璃试管中，一天也会自我损耗四分之一。其本身可产热，一小时内就能融化一块与自身同等质量的冰。如果将其与冷气隔绝，则其自身温度会高于外界。如果将其放置在玻璃器皿中，则能使玻璃变成淡紫色甚至是紫色。如果用纸张或脱脂棉包裹它，它能让两者腐化。即便夜间不点蜡烛，该元素发出的光亮也能让人阅读。

最神奇的一点是，镭元素的光并不自有。它能将光传送给周围事物，即便这样的慷慨奉送并不总受人欢迎。

这也为人类的未来生活带来裨益，因为它的光可以让真钻发光，让赝品暴露无遗。钻石的买家可以用镭元素来测定物品的真伪。

玛丽发现镭元素对所有的实验都会产生干扰。只要被放在镭元素试管旁边，任何物质都会产生放射性。镭元素将光传播给空气、灰尘、玛丽的衣服、实验仪器，甚至是笔记本。即便是在镭元素消损后，这些周围的事物仍带着它的光亮。

科学家喜欢看到自己的想法被颠覆，所以早些年刚发现镭元素的时候，一定曾令科学家们兴奋不已。因为不仅镭元素本身能创造出新元素，而且新元素本身又会产生新物质，如此类推。母元素的物质发生转变，产生新的放射性元素，而这些新元素又具有不同的属性。但镭带给科学家们的震惊还远不止于此。他们发现在特定的时长内，每一种放射性元素都能自我损耗将近一半，而这段时长是固定不变的，这段时间很长，长得足以让人们觉得无须担心会失去这些放射性元素。铀元素要想全部耗尽需要几十亿年。镭元素仅需一千六百年，而它的子元素仅需四天，子元素的子元素仅需要几秒钟而已。

镭元素静静地躺在那里，当你望向它的时候，它还在不断地产生新的子元素。镭元素本身和新元素都在不断消耗，或者相互碰撞。

突然间，这种新元素又表现出了一种新属性，好似之前表现出的特性都不足为奇一样。皮埃尔仍在苦苦研究时，被镭元素灼伤了。他手上的皮肤发红，但并没有疼痛感。随后颜色越来越红，第二十天的时候，伤口就像普通灼伤一样开始结痂，然后出现溃疡。到第四十二天时，皮肤表面的溃疡痊愈。

玛丽一开始并没料到会被镭元素灼伤，但却突然发现自己也被灼伤了，尽管镭元素装在玻璃试管里，且存放在锡盒里。

随后是他们的朋友贝可勒尔，他将盛着镭元素的玻璃试管放在自己的夹克口袋里，在回家的路上也被严重灼伤。

“这个可恶的孩子，”他向玛丽抱怨道，“它灼伤我做什么？我多么珍视它，但现在可对它充满怨气。”而现在，玛丽对这个一直视为掌上明珠的新元素也颇有怨言，因为她手指尖被伤得很重，都脱皮了。

然而很快，人们就能正确认识镭元素的灼伤性了，因为伤口愈合得很好。医生对这一现象颇感兴趣。他们用镭射线去除坏死的皮肤，伤口愈合后，疾病也就消除了。全世界都燃起了希望。也许镭射线可被用来治愈癌症。

这至少证明了镭元素的价值。人们都等待着它的销售。玛丽从八吨沥青铀矿中提炼出了一克镭。这些镭价值三万法郎，但不外售。玛丽将其视若珍宝，打算在她有生之年精心保管，并把它留在了实验室，作为勤奋与成功的珍贵象征。

某个周末的早晨，皮埃尔和玛丽坐在凯勒曼大道的家中，邮差送来了一封贴着美国邮票的信给皮埃尔。他仔细看完信，折好放在书桌上。

“我们得谈谈，”他说，“谈谈镭元素。要批量生产了。他们从布法罗寄了封信来，询问有关镭元素的信息。”

“嗯？”玛丽有些不耐烦。

“嗯，不过我们还有选择权……我们可以将自己的研究成果及提炼方法公布于天下……”

“当然。”玛丽微笑道。

“或者，”皮埃尔继续说道，丝毫没在意自己被打断，“我们也可将自己视为这项成果的主人，镭元素的发明者。这样的话，在公布从沥青铀矿中提炼镭元素的方法以前，我们就要申请专利，之后便能从世界各地镭元素的生产中获利。”

皮埃尔的话清楚地表明，只要接受专利申请，便有一笔巨额财富等待着他们。

镭的生产专利能给他们带来足够的财富，建造一座宏伟的实验室，购买镭元素来进行研究。如果有钱了，还能做好多好多的事！

玛丽沉思了一会儿，随即说道：“这不可能。这样有违科学精神。”

皮埃尔完全同意，但他让玛丽仔细考虑，一旦做出决定就不能反悔。他提醒玛丽也要考虑两个人都梦寐以求的实验室，考虑考虑女儿的未来。她真的确信自己不想成为富人吗？

玛丽熟知科学家的惯有约定，像法国化学家巴斯德这样的伟人都会遵守的约定，她说：“物理学家经常发表研究成果，我们的发现能谋利只是机缘巧合。镭元素能治病救人，我觉得不能从中谋取私利。”

皮埃尔也同意，靠镭元素的知识赚钱有违科学精神。他当晚就写了回信，将镭元素的所有研究信息毫无保留地告诉了美国人。

于是，皮埃尔和玛丽放弃了成为百万富翁的良机，但丝毫不后悔。他们不会对镭元素申请专利并借机谋利。是科学精神将镭元素带到他们面前，并呈现给世人。不论当今社会如何世风日下，他们仍然崇尚这种将知识无私奉献给全人类的科学精神。在财富与贫穷面前选择了后者之后，玛丽和皮埃尔又骑上了自行车，像往常的假日一样，到夏季的树林里为家中采集野花。





第十四章　黑暗


玛丽和皮埃尔声名鹊起。法国为两个人颁奖。英国向他们发出邀请。他们从法国带了一件礼物送给英国朋友开尔文，那就是装在玻璃瓶中的微量镭元素，开尔文带着孩子般灿烂的笑容骄傲地向自己科学界的朋友们展示。皮埃尔将在皇家学院就镭元素作演讲，玛丽也将成为第一位获准在此神圣庄严的科学殿堂参加会议的女性。此次演讲盛况空前，在座的全都是英国知识渊博的著名学者，皮埃尔向他们展示了镭元素的神奇力量。皇家学院为之振奋，整个伦敦都渴望一睹镭元素“父母”的风采。他们专门为两个人举办了宴会，权贵们打扮得珠光宝气，他们带着惊讶的神情望向玛丽——这位伟大的女性科学家，只穿了一条朴素的黑裙子就来赴宴，没戴任何首饰，她那被酸液腐蚀的双手也没戴任何戒指；但这丝毫没有影响她的高贵，她身材高挑，面庞光彩照人，额头光洁高挺，拥有一双炯炯有神的大眼睛。玛丽自己很喜欢周围的繁华盛景，但她却有点惊讶地发现，平常对于宴会漠不关心的皮埃尔，显然也已经沉浸在了这种眼花缭乱之中。

“珠宝很美艳吧？”玛丽问他，“我从没想过世间还有如此美丽的东西。”

皮埃尔大笑。“你知道，”他说，“吃晚宴的时候我没事儿干，脑子里就在想，这些珠宝加起来能建多少设备齐全的实验室啊！”

天啊！居里夫妇的确“与众不同”。他们了解发光物质，但却搞不懂珠光宝气的石头。皇家学会授予玛丽戴维奖章，夫妻二人甚至不知道该拿这金质奖章作何用。皮埃尔把它给艾琳当摔不碎、咬不坏的玩具，艾琳非常喜欢。

他们也不知道该如何对待名誉、人群、掌声和记者。这些只会徒增玛丽的痛苦。

1903年12月10日，玛丽与亨利·贝可勒尔分别被授予诺贝尔科学奖。她是科学界第一位获此殊荣的女性，但并没引起她多大的兴奋。她反而更享受荣誉带来的实际影响：科学家们对她工作的认可，获得经费的欣慰；但闪光灯和曝光、名誉、陌生人寄来的庆祝信、要签名的请求、摄影师和记者们邀约采访的请求等，这些事情她并不喜欢。“我恨不得把自己藏起来，借此得到片刻安宁。”她写道。

玛丽喜欢能支配金钱的感觉，而她支配金钱的方式也完全体现出她的真挚善良与个人魅力。她把一部分钱存进银行，这样获得的收入就能雇个帮手在实验室里帮忙，皮埃尔也能辞去在物理学院的教师职位，潜心科研。此外，她还给杜鲁斯基夫妇在波兰创办的养老院捐赠了一笔钱。给皮埃尔的哥哥和自己的姐姐们买了礼物；对科学协会进行捐赠；资助了一些波兰学生、实验室的男孩们以及一个急需帮助的塞尔夫女孩。玛丽随后又记起了自己年迈的法国老师，老师目前客居波兰，平生的夙愿就是能再回到她深爱的法国看看。玛丽给老师写了封信，并寄去了车旅费，邀请她前来法国和自己同住。那位年迈的老妇人面对这意料之外的幸福喜极而泣。最后，玛丽还给自己准备了一份礼物——给位于凯勒曼大道的家装了现代化的洗浴室，给起居室更换了新壁纸。

但遗憾的是！平庸的大众！不是集资建设实验室，让居里夫妇做更多镭方面的研究，他们的过分关注让玛丽在大街上要躲躲藏藏才能顺利回家，浪费了她大量的时间。报纸上刊登居里夫妇生活的小细节，侵犯到了夫妻二人的隐私，即使连艾琳这个小孩子对保姆说的话，连屋顶上花猫的颜色都被一一曝光在众人面前。玛丽抗议道：“他们严重影响了我们的工作。我们的生活也被荣誉和光环破坏了！”她说的没错。玛丽寡言忙碌，却几乎被缺乏理性的大众逼疯了。一次，居里夫妇去参加法国总统的晚宴，一位女士走向玛丽，请求她将自己引荐给希腊国王。“我觉得没这必要。”玛丽语气平和，但目光坚定。那位女士其实就是卢贝总统的夫人，玛丽的回答让她很惊讶。“当然……我当然会尊重您的意见。”她面色绯红，吞吞吐吐地说道。能面见国王对许多人来说是莫大的殊荣，但玛丽不同寻常。她年轻，并对这一切深感厌倦。她渴望休假，能自由放松地生活，做一位寻常的母亲，一位普通的妻子。她希望艾琳的咳嗽能快点好起来，希望皮埃尔的病痛快点消去。从上一次她在波兰跳过舞后，这二十年间她的生活中只有工作，但她也没像现在这样渴望无所事事，渴望忘掉自己是著名的居里夫人。她只想再成为那个简单的玛丽，尽情吃草莓、睡觉、享受生活。

但皮埃尔此时根本停不下来。他手边有大量的工作要做。他无法理解玛丽想放假的心情——这种愿望太小女孩化了，太不符合科学精神。皮埃尔告诉玛丽，他们必须要为科学献身，玛丽顺从了。她一直都顺着皮埃尔的心意。但她真的筋疲力尽了，累到连自己肚中的孩子伊芙都不想要。“可怜的小家伙，”她说，“要生活在这纷乱的世界里。” 事实上，她的那些仰慕者和追随者，严重影响到了她对于生活的勇气和幸福感，这是无比残忍的。

然而，伊芙的出生也为她带来了乐趣，玛丽喜欢孩子，她还能顺理成章地享受伊芙出生带来的产假——伊芙长着黑色的头发和蓝色的眼睛，与艾琳金黄色的头发和淡褐色的眼睛完全不同。伊芙不愿躺在摇篮里，奋力挣扎着抗议，玛丽不忍心让她在摇篮里哭泣，心软地将她抱起，一直哄到她入睡为止。

在伊芙出生前，巴黎大学给玛丽授予了一项特权，即可在皮埃尔的实验室里工作。她其实一直就在实验室里工作，但学校不知怎的突然醒悟，给了她这项任命——任命她为“物理学科的组建者”，一年有九十六法郎的薪水。众所周知，居里夫妇一直都是并肩作战，学校目前也认可了这一点。他们的时间、思想和工作都自然平分，就好像是一个人。

1905年6月，皮埃尔和玛丽来到了风景秀丽的斯德哥尔摩，皮埃尔受邀以二人共同的名义发表演讲，这也和诺贝尔奖相关。他对瑞典大加赞赏，用尽溢美之词，这个国家遍布着湖泊、峡湾，周围仅有一点陆地，两个人享受着不被打扰的静谧，享受着这个国家毫无压力的礼遇。

玛丽有时会和陌生人交朋友。有位名为洛伊·富勒的美国芭蕾舞演员，她用奇幻的灯光让舞蹈显得更加美轮美奂。她写信问玛丽，如何能利用镭元素照亮自己的蝴蝶袖。皮埃尔和玛丽虽然觉得这想法很奇怪，但还是回信委婉地解释了镭射线的性能。洛伊回信道，她唯一能表达感谢之情的方式，就是来居里夫妇家现场跳一段芭蕾舞。居里夫妇接受了这不同寻常的感谢方式。一天，一个打扮奇特、拥有孩童般蓝眼睛的女孩出现在他们家门口，身后还跟着一队电气师。电气师鼓捣了一整天。晚上，居里夫妇家的餐厅点缀着各式各样的彩灯，装扮如同仙境，洛伊跳着舞，交替出现火苗、鲜花、飞鸟和巫术。

这位小小的艺术家成了居里夫妇的好朋友，并将两个人引荐给了自己伟大的雕刻家朋友罗丹。坐在罗丹的工作室里，在铸件和大理石中，这几个来自科学、雕刻和舞蹈领域的人彻夜交谈，相谈甚欢。

时间到了1906年的4月。在法国的骄阳下，紫罗兰盛开，芳香四溢，紫色和白色的花朵相映，装点着谢夫勒斯山谷里的灌木。玛丽和皮埃尔带着艾琳和伊芙在此度假。晚上，一家人去农场里打奶；伊芙这个小魔头，在学步车里蹒跚走路，逗得大家哈哈大笑。早晨，皮埃尔和玛丽骑着自行车，穿过树林采摘鲜花，再看一看蜜月时发现的林间湖泊。湖水已干涸，水仙花也不见了，唯有四周环绕着的黄色芦苇，像一顶色彩鲜亮的皇冠。玛丽和皮埃尔漫步回家，从河岸边采回了紫罗兰和蓝色的长春花。

第二天中午，他们沐浴在阳光里，艾琳举着绿网捕蝴蝶，发出兴奋的尖叫声和欢笑声。

“生活待你不薄，玛丽。”皮埃尔低声说道。

晚饭过后，皮埃尔就搭乘火车返回巴黎工作，随身携带着他们在湖边采摘的黄色芦苇。第二天，玛丽也带着孩子们重返巴黎，4月亦如它的节气，变得潮湿阴冷。

1906年4月19日，玛丽和孩子们已经返还家中——这是潮湿的一天，街道上泥泞湿滑，天空阴暗，布满乌云。皮埃尔在城里还有几项工作要做，玛丽则要回家整理家务，在镇上还有些事要处理。她忙碌且快乐地走来走去。六点钟她到家，很高兴能再次回到舒适的家中，渴望见到皮埃尔，与他像往常一样一同进行科研到深夜。

她打开客厅的门。看见三名男士站起身来，带着深深的敬意，仿佛将玛丽视为女王。在他们的神情中玛丽读到了沉痛的忧伤。她之前的老师保罗·阿佩尔告诉玛丽，皮埃尔在街上滑倒了，被运货马车的轮子碾到了头。

“皮埃尔死了吗？……死了吗？真的死了吗？”她问道。

伊芙长大后，撰写了母亲的生平事迹，她告诉我们，从知道皮埃尔去世的那一刻起，一种孤独与无助就深深萦绕在玛丽心头，从那个悲伤的四月起，她就一个人被孤独地留在了人世间。





第十五章　无论发生什么


玛丽天生具有非凡的勇气。终其一生，她都不断鼓足勇气努力生活，内心越来越强大，甚至坚不可摧。再者，她曾深爱过一个伟大人物，皮埃尔留给她一句话，令她终身铭记，即便周围的世界轰然崩塌。“无论发生什么，”某次两个人谈到死亡时，他曾说过，“无论发生什么，即使徒留一副空皮囊，失去了精气神，人也要努力工作。”政府要给玛丽颁发抚恤金，但被她拒绝了，她说自己还年轻，能自食其力，养活自己和孩子。

她找到了一种自我安慰的方式，但这只会更让人心疼。她每天写日记，仿佛在与皮埃尔对话：

他们让我替代你的职位，我的皮埃尔，你所有的讲座和实验室的职位。我接受了。我不知道自己这样做对不对。你经常对我说，希望我能在巴黎大学授课。我很希望能继续你未完的事业。从一方面看，这是维持生活最容易的方式，而从另一面看，我就像个傻瓜。

1906年5月7日：

我的皮埃尔，我止不住想你。我的脑子里全是你，我已失去理性。我不能想象没有你的日子。你是我生活的伴侣，我无法想象不能再对你微笑的日子。树木发新芽，花园景色优美。今早，我带着孩子们欣赏花园美景。你不知道她们现在有多可爱，如果你在，肯定会带我去看盛开的长春花和水仙……

5月14日：

我想告诉你，他们已经提名我为巴黎大学物理学院院长，也就是你先前的职位，有些人愚蠢到因此而祝贺我。

玛丽并没有因为对傻瓜强烈的愤怒而感到心烦意乱。之前没有女性能在这一领域担任学科带头人，但在法国还没有人能接替皮埃尔的工作，因此这个重担自然就落在了玛丽肩上。也只有她一人有此天赋。她决定要好好备课才能对得起皮埃尔的盛名，于是将孩子送到乡下，整个夏天都待在巴黎，继续皮埃尔的研究课题、研究成果。

她需要换一间房子，决定定居在皮埃尔长眠的索城。孩子们的爷爷有点担心，如果玛丽搬去更小的房子，会不会就不想和他生活在一起。不过这种问题他怎么能问出口？玛丽也担心他会不会因为儿子去世，而不愿单独和儿媳妇住在一起。老人最终还是打破了尴尬的局面，“皮埃尔已经不在了，玛丽，你没有理由再和老人家生活在一起。我可以和大儿子他们一起生活。这由你决定。”

“不，您来决定，”玛丽低声说道，“如果您走了，会让我伤心难过。但您有权力选择自己喜欢的生活方式。”

“玛丽，我当然更偏向于跟着你们一同生活啦。”

玛丽要走出去面对外界的那一天还是来了，全世界都对她的忧伤痛苦充满了柔情与尊重，她也要习惯自己是位名人寡妇的身份。她清楚各大报纸都在要求巴黎大学改变规定，能让自己在半圆形的大讲堂里授课，这样成千上万名学生就能听到这位科学界的第一夫人在巴黎大学的授课。玛丽应该很欣慰，因为巴黎大学是世界上最保守的地方之一，并不容易改变校方规定。她听说沸腾的人群渴望来听讲座，正在热烈讨论她讲课的内容、她会如何评论自己的丈夫，因为每一任新的学科带头人都要对上一任大加赞赏，这是学校不成文的惯例。依照惯例，还要感谢教育部部长，感谢学校。就职演讲那天，人们就像群鸟守候猎物，殷切期待着玛丽的演讲会感人至深，甚至预期或许会看到她情绪失控。讲堂并不大，人们蜂拥而至，推挤着那些真正来上课的学生，甚至都将学生挤出了座位。

在雷鸣般的掌声中，玛丽快步走进教室。很快一片安静，她站在皮埃尔生前站的位置上，开始讲授高等物理：“回顾过去十年物理学界发生的变化，我们惊讶于自己对电和物质认知的变化……”

听众很惊讶,惊讶的是出乎意料的结果，而非电的变化。他们本期待来看一场表演，却发现眼前的这位女士完全没有任何表演的痕迹，真实虔诚，一心只考虑工作，而非自己。他们深受触动，泪水涌上眼眶。玛丽讲起了电结构、原子裂变和放射性物质的新理论。在课堂最后，她简单总结知识，简洁快速地离开了教室，如同来时一样。

如果说她之前的工作艰难，那现在则变得愈发困难。她要摸索出教育孩子的方法。同时，要兼顾实验室的科学研究和巴黎大学的授课。她还有家要照看，有花园要打理。她有一件特别的事情要做。她想方设法建了一座以皮埃尔命名的实验室——这一直是他梦寐以求的事。

在索城的新家里，伊芙和艾琳与蓝眼睛的祖父快乐度日。他教艾琳植物学、自然历史和诗歌，帮她在花园里开垦了一小块空地，种上色彩明亮的鲜花，而伊芙则在一旁的草丛里玩乌龟或者追赶小黑猫和小花猫玩儿。

玛丽早上总是匆匆忙忙，踩着她快捷的商务步伐，追赶前往巴黎的火车，到晚上华灯初上时方才回家。孩子们一天也见不上妈妈几面，但孩子们一天的学习计划都由玛丽制订。她们早上起来要先学习一小时。艾琳喜欢数学，而伊芙热爱音乐。随后不论天气如何，她们都要外出散步，然后去喜欢的体育馆。之后，她们再做些烹饪，或是搭搭模型、做些手工，或是园艺。周末或节假日，她们就会跟着母亲去骑车或游泳。玛丽要孩子们变得坚强和无所畏惧。玛丽让她们锻炼得无惧黑暗或灾难，不害怕攀爬，不害怕骑行或动物，不畏惧一切。要勇敢坚毅也要浪漫热情。玛丽教孩子们波兰语，但她不想让孩子们也饱受和自己相似的折磨，感觉自己被两个国家牵引，尤其一方还是一个被压迫的国家。孩子们的教育中只有一项未曾涉及——与陌生人打交道、在舞会上突出自己的艺术。两个孩子在这方面没经过任何练习。

玛丽不希望孩子们过于疲劳，但法国学校上学时间长，有时上六小时课还要再做三小时的作业。玛丽和大学朋友经常讨论这一问题，他们决定让孩子们休学，在家自己教。这真是伟大的想法。这些幸运的小孩一天只用上一节课，但老师却是巴黎最伟大的科学家们。第一天早上，他们赶到巴黎大学实验室，由让·佩兰教授化学。“巴黎大学还没被逼急，”报纸上写道，“但我们拭目以待。”第二天去乡下由保罗·朗之万教授数学；第三天去找玛格洛这位雕塑家学习雕刻塑形；再一天是现代语言文学教授授课；周四下午来物理学院找玛丽·居里学物理。这些幸运儿呀！

在这神圣的殿堂里，从没上过如此简单的课程。他们将漆黑的自行车轴承滚珠落在倾斜的白板上，亲眼观察自由落体的曲线。有时，玛丽还会问他们一些简单的问题，比如：“要维持盘子里液体的温度，该怎么做？”

“用羊毛裹着。”一名学生说。

“与外界隔绝。”另一名建议道。

“我，”玛丽微笑道，“肯定会先盖上盖子。”

然而不幸的是，父母都要忙于赚钱养家，根本没时间给孩子一直上课。愉快的课程结束了，伊芙和艾琳还是回到了学校，不过这所学校的上学时间没有大多学校那么长。孩子们后来回忆，小时候上的这些课让她们勤奋而热爱工作，对金钱处之泰然，独立自主，认为自己能克服任何困难。

在实验室取得的诸多成功中，玛丽有一个最伟大的成就。那时她已经提炼出了镭盐。随后，她又和安德鲁·德比恩成功制成了镭金属。但只成功了一次。无论他俩还是其他人之后再也没制成过。

1911年，玛丽被授予诺贝尔化学奖。在此之前，还没有人能荣获两项诺贝尔奖。

那么大家肯定会猜想，整个世界都将像对待科学家一样崇敬她，像对待悲伤的女人那样怜悯她。但不幸的是，有些人在听到别人成功或目睹他人的美丽时，会大加忌妒，这是一种奇怪的病态心理。玛丽兼具成功与美丽，于是有人开始给她写匿名信，编造她的坏话，指责她的错误，这连她自己都没想过。她的朋友们试图保护她，但想战胜躲在暗处的敌人并不容易。他们觉得最好的保护，就是科学协会公开授予殊荣，让她成为其中一员。这是她当之无愧的，但此前还从未有过女性成员入会。编造谎言的人又变换把戏，想方设法阻碍选举。他们甚至将一张错误的选举条塞进玛丽一位盲人朋友的手中，造谣她的朋友都开始反对她。科学协会最终还是以一票之差无情地将她拒之门外。

玛丽对谣言很是气愤。一段时间，她都要假借姐姐的名字来躲避反对者。她如白昼一样光明磊落，而她的攻击者却躲在暗处，这让她觉得恶心。这件事几乎摧毁了她的勇气，也让她陷入了痛苦和疾病的深渊。医生说手术可以治愈疼痛，但她说手术时间要推后，直到她参加完下一届物理学会议。她仍然果敢坚毅。

之后她在生病期间，还做了一项伟大的决定。她早已筋疲力尽，更不愿思考太多，但波兰决定在华沙修建一所大型放射物质实验室，邀请她任实验室主任。她多想接受！多么诱人的邀请！人们告诉玛丽波兰需要她，她的祖国现在处于颓废低迷期，需要一些事物让它重振精神。

但其实很多年前，玛丽就已经做出决定，尽管她十分热爱祖国波兰，但她更深爱着皮埃尔·居里。她仍然深爱着他，而皮埃尔和波兰仍旧在往两个不同的方向拉扯着她。如果玛丽选择了波兰，就意味着要放弃建设皮埃尔梦想中的实验室。如果玛丽不待在法国，皮埃尔的梦想就不会成真。她只能忍痛拒绝了波兰。

但波兰仍坚持让玛丽远程指导新实验室的修建，并出席剪彩仪式。在此次访问波兰期间，还发生了许多激动人心的事情。第一，她在波兰发表了科学方面的主题演讲，这是她人生中第一次用母语进行科学演讲。第二，她出席了一场在博物馆举办的盛大庆祝仪式，她曾在那儿进行了自己的第一场物理实验。第三，在波兰妇女为她举办的欢迎会上，她遇到了自己第一间学校的老校长。玛丽匆忙穿过人群走向那位老妇人，亲吻她的双颊。老校长看到自己以前的学生成了举世闻名的女科学家，该有多开心！

玛丽得到了一次休假的机会。她准备背着自己的小背包在瑞士闲逛，教会艾琳和伊芙爬山，教她们欣赏峡谷美景。

同行的还有一位朋友，他和玛丽大谈特谈物理学，孩子们不得不盯着他，以防他掉进峡谷中。但她们好奇地听着他口中谈论的那些奇特的事，整个过程中充满了欢笑，根本没人会去注意峡谷。

“夫人您看啊，”他说道，“我想知道的是：如果电梯掉入真空状态，那么里面的乘客间会发生什么？” 这问题对伊芙和艾琳来说，听上去并不难，而且很有趣。她们不知道自己听到的其实是高深的“相对论”，而这位看似粗心大意的朋友不是别人，正是伟大的物理学家爱因斯坦本人。

当时，玛丽的情绪渐渐好转，因为皮埃尔·居里大街上的皮埃尔镭研究所的围墙已经开始修建。巴斯德研究所的罗博士曾在两年前提议，要筹钱给居里夫人修建实验室。这件事让巴黎大学突然意识到，巴斯德研究所很可能会从他们手中将居里夫人抢走。为防止这样的损失，双方达成一致，共同建设新实验室。

玛丽心中充满欢乐。她参与制订计划，同建筑师探讨所有房间和窗户的形状，坚持设计大窗户，保证良好的采光。她同时坚持打理花园，在实验室开建前，自己种了树和玫瑰，希望在实验室建成时能添些光彩。

1914年7月，她终于看到了门前石柱上刻着的字：居里大街镭研究所。

玛丽告诉我们，她想起了巴斯德曾说过的话：

“如果你在意那些造福于人类的成就……如果你因祖国曾参与这些伟大发现而骄傲，我恳求你待在那被我们称为实验室的神圣地方潜心工作，不忘初心。祈求实验室的数量不断增多，这样能创造出更多奇迹。它们是未来的神殿，是财富与福祉的圣堂。就是在这里，人类渐渐变得愈发伟大、强壮、优秀。在实验室里，人类研究造物者的精美作品，也是世界进步与和平的象征。而人类自身的作品，通常野蛮粗暴，具有毁灭性。”

1914年7月，玛丽见证了皮埃尔实验室的竣工，回忆起了巴斯德的这段话。实验室虽建好了，但玛丽还要再等四年。在整整四年的战争之后，她才能看到镭研究所的正常运营，看到皮埃尔的梦想成真。





第十六章　战争


1914年8月1日

亲爱的艾琳，亲爱的伊芙，

情况变得越来越糟糕：我们随时都可能要准备撤离——我不知道自己是否需要撤离。保持冷静，勇敢镇定。如果没有战争，我周一就能到；如果战争爆发，我就只能先待在这儿，再尽快去接你们。艾琳，我们俩一定要发挥自己的作用。




8月2日

开始撤离了，德国人还没宣战就进驻了法国。可能有很长一段时间都无法通信了。

巴黎一切平和，除了对上前线打仗的男人们的不舍与忧伤。




8月6日

勇敢的小比利时没有对德国不战而退。所有的法国人民都充满希望，这场战争尽管艰辛，最终一定能取得胜利。

波兰已经被德国占领。打完仗，我的祖国还能留下什么？我已经收不到家中的任何消息了。

玛丽给远在布列塔尼度假的孩子们写信说道。

玛丽一个人在巴黎极其孤独。她的同事们都前去参加战事，除了一名因为有心脏病而不能参战的机械工。玛丽病了，身体虚弱。但她还没想到这场战争会给自己的研究工作带来什么样的灾难。玛丽也没随大流，像其他女人一样前去当护士。一如既往，她脑子转得飞快：思考她的工作能为战争做些什么。前线和后方的医院几乎都没有X射线设备，没有这项新设备，医生怎么才能检查病人的枪伤以及伤口深处的碎片？X射线和玛丽本没什么交集，她只是对此比较感兴趣，上过几节课。这并不重要。眼前着急的是，要快速建立起X射线站。她只用了几小时，就把巴黎可用的X射线设备列出一张清单，并分发到了各大医院。玛丽找了所有可能会用X射线的科学家，将任务分配下去。这就是巴黎能提供的。

但前方大量的伤员被运送回来，成千上万的伤员被救护车从前线送回战地医院，他们该怎么办？玛丽丝毫不敢犹豫。时间就是一切。她向法国女子联盟筹集资金，制造了第一辆“放射车”。这是由普通汽车改装的，利用汽车上的发动机给X射线设备供电。在贫穷、破烂但风景秀美的马恩河乡下，X射线流动车在不同的医院之间来回奔波，让战场上的伤员能得到快速的救治、安全的手术，如果没有X射线流动车，那么很多人将不能治愈。

但在马恩河战役之前，德国的战线仅离巴黎几公里远。他们能冲破防线吗？他们会占领巴黎吗？玛丽应该怎么办？她的孩子还在布列塔尼。她要去和孩子们团聚吗？医疗队撤离巴黎时她该跟着走吗？不。她要待在巴黎，无论发生什么。因为，她写道：“如果我守护着皮埃尔·居里实验室的新楼，德国人应该就不敢摧毁它；如果没人在这儿守卫，德国人肯定会将这里夷为平地。”坚强不屈的玛丽最痛恨当逃兵。害怕只会助长敌人的威风。无论如何，她都不会让敌人得逞，进入无人看管的皮埃尔·居里研究所！但是，就算玛丽不离开巴黎，她那珍贵的镭元素也必须运走，而且只能由她自己护送镭元素安全撤离。

她穿上黑色的长袍，收拾好行装，提着小巧但极重的铅箱，搭火车前往法国波尔多地区。车厢内十分拥挤，玛丽蜷缩在木椅上，脚边搁着存放镭的箱子，注视着窗外九月初骄阳炙烤的田野，道路上川流不息的汽车以及在其中穿梭前行的小货车。

在波尔多的西海岸边，玛丽站在月台上，脚边放着小铅箱，一小时又一小时地焦急等待着，这箱子对一个女人来说太重了，但却弥足珍贵。月台上没有搬运工，没有出租车，也没有休息室。她苦笑着，猜想自己是不是一整晚都要站在这里。但最后，一位同行的旅客向她伸出援手，帮她找到休息的床位，镭元素被送到了银行保管。

第二天清晨，玛丽返回巴黎。晚上，她还只是一名毫不起眼的旅客，夹杂在逃往安全地带的人群中，而早上她就又回到了众人的视线范围内，大家都想看看“那女人又重新回来了”这样不同寻常的新闻！这位重返巴黎的伟大女性很高兴能有机会告诉众人，巴黎并不危险，巴黎不会陷落，这里的居民不会生活在水深火热之中。而实际上，这位重返巴黎的伟大女性早已饥肠辘辘。她从前一天晚上起就再也没吃过东西。她所搭乘的运兵列车一路上不是在田野间停顿休整，就是在朝着巴黎缓缓爬行。她很感激身边一位友善的士兵，他从背包中掏出一片面包分给她充饥。当她抵达陷入战争危险的美丽巴黎时，也迎来了激动人心的消息：敌军被挡在了马恩河外。

没做片刻休整，玛丽就急匆匆地赶往国家救助协会总部，想要贡献一份力量。

“休息吧，夫人！”协会主席阿佩尔说道，“躺下好好休息一番。”她顺从地点点头，不过又开始讨论未来的工作了。“她苍白的脸上一双大眼睛炯炯有神，”阿佩尔说，“就像一团燃烧的火焰。”

随后，她改装了更多的“小居里”射线车。玛丽的两个孩子远在布列塔尼，但对法国的士兵而言，她也是X射线车的母亲。从前线受伤的战士回到后方，第一时间就能见到这样的救助车。玛丽在实验室中一辆一辆改装好射线车，从极不情愿的官员那里搜集所需的一切物资。这位曾经害羞腼腆的女性，现在却为了她的救护车而据理力争，成为一个不容忽视的人。她从某人那里拿到“通行证”，从另一个人那里获得“通行口谕”，又从其他人那里拿到护照——富人捐的钱，好心人送的汽车——“我会还的，”她说，“如果这些东西战争结束后还能用，我肯定会还的。”

玛丽给自己找了一辆雷诺车，比普通轿车要大，像货车一般。随后就开始在外奔波。

巴黎家中的电话响了。一大群伤员需要X射线车的治疗。玛丽将车刷成灰色，上面划着大大的红十字臂章。车上塞满伤员后，玛丽穿上黑大衣，胳膊上别着红十字，戴着她柔软但有些褪色的圆帽子，背着泛黄褪色的旧背包,爬上副驾驶的座位。这辆破旧的老爷车全速前进，无论白天黑夜,刮风下雨，玛丽都跟随射线车深入战争前线，去到那些战事吃紧的地方——亚眠、伊普雷、凡尔登。

哨兵将他们拦下盘问，随后放行。雷诺车停到医院门口。居里夫人找到房间，将仪器搬进去。她迅速将仪器摆好，其他人则摆好电缆，将仪器与车载发电机连好。司机启动了汽车，玛丽调好电流。玛丽将一切准备就绪，戴上手套和眼镜，准备好铅笔和导线。把灯关上，拉上窗帘，如果没有窗帘就用床单遮住窗户。同时，将旁边的房间准备好，用作洗片暗室。

只用了半小时，一切就准备妥当，医生也就位了。随后大批伤员被担架抬进手术室。一个接一个，一个接一个。玛丽调试好仪器，这样，医生就可以准确检查伤员的骨头形状或器官上的阴影。

身边的助手会根据医生的口述记录下金属的位置，为之后的手术做准备。有时医生边观察边做手术，用镊子深入病人的伤口，从骨头碎片中挑出碎弹片。

时间一点点流逝，有时手术一做就是好几天。只要有伤员，玛丽就要待在旁边的暗室里。在离开医院前，玛丽计划在医院建立一个永久的X射线站。玛丽竭尽全力建成射线站，仅用了短短几天就带回来新的仪器和一名放射线学者，根本没人知道她是从哪儿找到的。

就这样，玛丽独自一人在各大医院建立起了两百个X射线站，二十辆射线车治好了一百多万伤员。这对一位女性来说，简直就是壮举。

但我们也不能把玛丽想得无所不能，她开车时旁边总是坐着一位老司机，负责安全。有时她必须自己开车，握着那充满魔力的换挡杆。如果路面平坦，没有太多沟沟坎坎，玛丽就很开心，但这些道路上经常有各种各样的断面。在战争年代那天寒地冻的日子里，玛丽那纤细且被镭元素灼伤的手指还要冒着冰霜去换轮胎。有时她在清洗不太熟悉的汽缸时，也会像面对科学实验时那样皱着眉头。有时她还要做搬运工的工作，当男人都赶赴前线参战时，她要搬重物。

一次，她被惹怒了！司机突然一个急转弯，把车翻到了沟里，玛丽被压在了一大批松垮垮的箱子下面。她其实并不在意自己的身体。但担心会摔坏精密的仪器，所以她还是勃然大怒。年轻的司机小伙绕着车子一圈圈地寻找她，焦急地喊叫着：“夫人，你死了吗？夫人呀，你是死了吗？”玛丽听到时还是笑出了声。

有时玛丽会忘了要吃早饭或晚饭。她经常随处安睡——有床就睡床上，没床就睡在星空下。她可以坦然接受这一切，因为她从小就尝尽生活的苦楚，现在更是战争勇士。

但救助士兵的工作只是玛丽工作的一部分。一有时间，她就会整理好旧实验室里的仪器，送到皮埃尔·居里研究所的新实验室里。她将实验器械摆放好，渐渐整理出了一个科学的新天地。她前往波尔多地区取回了镭元素，每周她都会收集镭元素的“释放物”，装到试管里，送往医院。

随着X射线被应用得越来越广，放射学学者的缺口也越来越大。玛丽在新的镭元素研究所里给他们上课培训。有些学生天生愚笨，反应慢，但玛丽极具耐心且善解人意，她帮助学生，鼓励学生，直到学生们自己能胜任这份工作。整个教学过程中，玛丽都有女儿艾琳做助教，她那时已经十七岁了。艾琳当时还在巴黎大学学习放射学，但母亲却从未觉得孩子年龄小就不能在战地医院工作。

两年的时间，她们共培养了一百五十名放射科护士。

不过这一切还不够，玛丽又去了比利时医院。有时到了陌生的医院，那些打扮入时的护士们会将眼前这位穿着朴素甚至有些破旧的女士误认为清洁工，对待她缺乏礼数。不过玛丽并不在意，她只会因为与她在霍赫斯塔德并肩工作的某位护士或某位沉默寡言的士兵的努力而感到温暖与欣慰：伊丽莎白女王与比利时国王艾伯特。她自己已经摒弃了所有冷漠的言行，温和谦让，平易近人，为伤员带来鼓励和信心。她要不断地去向因不了解实情而担惊受怕的村民解释，那些看起来奇怪的仪器根本不会伤害到他们，就像普通的照相机一样。这时的玛丽重新找回了快乐。

她从不提及自己，也没听她说过自己是否疲惫，是否害怕炮弹落在周围。她每天做着自己分内的工作，就好像这是世间最天经地义的事。

但她渴望和平，渴望一切暴戾残忍都能终结！1918年11月11日，对她及整个世界来说是最欢欣鼓舞的一天，停战的炮声响彻天地，也让身在实验室的她激动不已。她和助手克莱因立刻冲出实验室，想买国旗装扮研究所，参与到举国欢庆的浪潮中。但巴黎市内根本没有国旗！他们只好把三种颜色的长布缝在一起。玛丽开着旧雷诺车，加入了街上狂欢的人群，丝毫没注意到车顶和挡泥板也站上了十位不速之客。

谁能猜到这之后还会有哪些好事发生？

对玛丽来说，不仅是法国从战争的恐惧中解脱了出来，她的祖国波兰亦是如此。波兰最终也得到了解放，重获独立。她给哥哥的信中写道：

“我们，‘在奴役下出生，在枷锁中长大’，终于见证了国家的复兴。”





第十七章　归家


玛丽再一次回到塞纳河畔自己的老式宽敞公寓中。塞纳河将法国的腹地分割成两个小岛：一个是轮船形状的西岱岛，法国的老城，坐落着庄严美丽、享有盛名的建筑；另一个是圣路易斯岛，同样古老但略显空旷。玛丽就住在圣路易斯岛的贝休恩码头。两个世纪前，贝休恩大街上住的都是公爵和贵族绅士。玛丽的公寓多有走廊和台阶，房间开阔宽敞，地势较高。她这辈子就没学会过如何享受财富，如何享乐。硕大的房间里，就只有几件桃木家具孤零零地立在光洁的地板上！她和艾琳都没注意到房间空阔、寒冷刺骨，只有伊芙愿意花钱将房间装扮得温馨优雅。但家中有一间房装扮得舒适惬意，即玛丽的书房，房间中摆放着书架，挂着皮埃尔的肖像，摆着鲜花。不过所有的房间都很亮堂，窗户高耸，没装窗帘，望向窗外就能见到如画般的景色：阳光下的塞纳河波光粼粼，游船来来往往，载重的驳船色彩鲜艳，远处的巴黎圣母院依稀可见。

玛丽当时就是看上了这座小岛的清幽安静，但事实上，她的家中经常是人声鼎沸。伊芙经常弹奏钢琴，猫在楼梯上玩耍，发出嘎吱嘎吱的声音，门铃和电话的丁零声常常打破沉静，耳边还经常传来河上的汽笛声。

每天清晨八点钟，玛丽矫健急促的步伐都提醒着艾琳和伊芙，忙碌的一天又要开始了。接下来的十六年里每天都是如此。八点四十五分，外面传来的三声喇叭声提醒玛丽，接她的小汽车已经在门外等候了。她迅速拿上帽子和大衣，急急忙忙跑下楼，让司机等待的时间可不能超过三分钟。她起初是让研究所的一位男士给她开车，等找到固定司机时，那个可怜的男人因为自己不能再给居里夫人开车而难过地抽泣。他们途经图尔内勒大桥，穿过拥挤的码头，到达拉丁区。据记载，这里最早是年轻学生享受诗情画意、安贫乐道的地方，而如今这里聚集着各大研究所。

玛丽站在皮埃尔·居里大街的镭研究所门前。大厅里挤满了人。每天早上，大厅都挤着一群人，玛丽将他们戏称为苏维埃委员会。各大院系的学生们在玛丽开始工作前就在此等候，以免占用她的研究时间。他们要么来问问题，要么来给老师看自己的研究成果，有些人甚至希望玛丽昨晚已经想好了新问题让他们解答。她也经常不负所望。“哦，某某先生，你的解决方案行不通，我给你提一点建议……”玛丽解答一个又一个难题，人群不断增加，每个人都带着难题而来。玛丽其实并不在意问题有多难。只是这些学生用断断续续的法语和英语问问题，这增加了解答的难度。研究所简直就是一座巴别塔，汇集着东西方各类语言。玛丽曾讲过她的一名中国学生与她用英语交流的故事：学生彬彬有礼，即便知道老师讲的不对，他也不会直接点出，而是诱导着老师用她聪明的大脑去发现自己心中的疑惑。玛丽说，她会在东方学生的面前因为自己的言行举止而感到羞愧，“他们真的比我们更注重礼节。”

一旦开始在大厅解答疑惑，就几乎是没完没了的，不过玛丽要学着适应。大厅里没有椅子，他们就坐在台阶上。想想她蹲坐在台阶上，身边围站着高大的学生，就觉得很有画面感。她是实验室主任，她读过所有用五种语言发表的关于镭研究的书籍，她仍在研发新技术，她好似具有超能力，她的学生对她的教学指导深信不疑。她胆大又心细。

学生一个个都回去做实验了。有时，有一两个学生会带着玛丽去看自己的实验成果；有时，玛丽终于有些时间，可以回到自己的实验室中进行研究。

中午她回家吃饭，也要在餐桌上和艾琳探讨物理学。伊芙有时跟不上谈话内容。妈妈和姐姐有时在说BB 原始状态和BB方形状态，在法语中BB的发音等同于“婴儿”的发音，伊芙心里还犯嘀咕：原始态的婴儿和方形婴儿都是什么呀。

1926年，艾琳嫁给了一位名叫约里奥的年轻有为的科学家，就剩伊芙陪在玛丽身边。

“亲爱的，讲讲你身边发生的事吧，”玛丽说，“大家都在做什么？” 伊芙就给她讲自己了解到的一切，玛丽对一切都感兴趣，尤其是那些简单幼稚的事。她喜欢听伊芙说自己开快车的事，或者艾琳的孩子每天都说什么话，以及人们对新法西斯主义支持者的看法。

“哦！”玛丽应答道。如果听到有人赞扬独裁者，她就会说，“我从小就生活在压迫下。你们没有。你们不知道能生活在自由的国度里是件多么幸福的事。”如果有人赞成政府处决反叛者，玛丽就会说，“把拉瓦锡这样的科学家送上断头台，我永远都想不通。”

午饭过后，汽车又来接她，有时会送她去花卉市场买点花园里的花或野花，玛丽不喜欢温室里种植的娇媚花朵。有时候她还要去卢森堡花园会见一位重要客人，她的外孙女依莲。她会坐下来同小家伙玩沙子，直到该去参加下午医学协会的会议。玛丽是参会的唯一一位女性，就坐在罗博士身旁，罗博士是巴斯德最忠实的学生。

参加完会议后，玛丽回到实验室，平时都会继续工作到晚餐时间，如果需要偶尔会到深夜两点。

有时研究所的静谧也会被诸如茶话会这样的活动扰乱，比如为了庆祝某个学生顺利拿到博士学位。实验室的器皿变成了茶杯，玻璃棒变成了搅拌勺，庆祝活动经常以玛丽的致辞结束，通常都是对新晋博士的赞美之词。其中最令人欣慰的两场就是艾琳及其丈夫弗雷德里克·约里奥获得博士学位的庆祝会。1934年，艾琳和约里奥获得了一项重大发现，成果堪比人工放射性物质的发现。他们用镭射线轰照铝元素和其他物质，将其变成具有放射性的新物质，这也成了能提炼镭的新来源。科学家看到了希望，也许有一天能制造出镭元素的替代物。多么美好的事物，在研究所院子另一侧的建筑里，人们正利用镭元素治疗癌症，这种方法也被称作居里治疗法。镭元素不可或缺，也弥足珍贵。

随后涌来了大量来信。想想名人收到的那些信件！幸运的是，有秘书为她拆信——有不假思索直接要签名的，当然不会收到回信，有直接问愚蠢问题的，有广告商的，也有乞丐的。一摞信件中只有一两封真正需要回复。

终于，玛丽要开始授课了。她并不喜欢讲课。每个周一、周三，她从早晨一直忙到下午五点，因为要一直站在小教室里给三十名学生上课。

那些年她面临着失明的危险。医生告诉她，她需要在几乎失明的状态中忍受将近两至三年，之后再接受手术治疗。医生们可能并没有想到这对她来说意味着什么。她想要继续科研事业，也不喜欢接受别人的同情和怜悯。无论发生什么，她都不想让别人知道自己眼睛的状况。伊芙用卡瑞夫人的名义去眼镜店给玛丽配眼镜。如果有学生的论文需要批改，她就聪明地用提问的方式来了解学生到底写了什么。她想尽一切聪明的办法来掩饰自己的不幸遭遇，那些隐隐猜到的人也假装自己什么都不知道。真是贴心！在接受了四次手术后，她开始训练眼睛，逐步恢复视力。视力虽然大不如前，但玛丽并不会为此丧失信心；她的眼睛再次恢复如常。

回到玛丽的日常生活吧。她和伊芙吃完晚饭后，伊芙要外出，这时疲惫的玛丽躺在沙发上，看着女儿换装。“鞋跟真糟糕，伊芙！我就不能理解为什么女人愿意踩着高跷走路。”

“还有现在流行的露背装都是什么呀？露在前面还能理解，可是露后背……当然裙子还是很漂亮的。转个圈，让我看看你有多漂亮。”玛丽惊讶地注视着女儿：“我对你化妆并不反对，我也知道你经常化妆。古埃及的女人真是发明了些糟糕的东西。我只能说一句：我觉得真难看。眉毛画得不好看，嘴唇也涂抹得不像话。”

“不过妈妈，我确实看起来更漂亮了。”

“漂亮了？听着，为了不看你那张化了妆的小脸，我只能明天一大早在你没化妆前就去床边亲吻你。”

伊芙离开后，玛丽躺在摇椅上，读一会儿诗，或看几页喜欢的小说，但都不会超过一小时。这层楼就是她的小天地——她有足够的空间在身边铺开各种物理文献，工作到深夜两点。

伊芙回到家，看见母亲沉浸在自己的工作中，就连她进家门也没发现。她专心致志地计算着物理问题，用波兰语喃喃自语，声音只有在课堂上的一半大。





第十八章　出国


1920年5月。天气炎热。巴黎的栗子花开了，玛丽一如既往在努力工作。但有件事即将打断她的工作，而这件事太出乎意料，她一点思想准备都没有。

玛丽从没见过报社记者，更别说女记者。她不喜欢接受采访，她讨厌曝光。面对要采访她的陌生人，玛丽总是有礼但坚决地说：“居里夫人不想……”

但生活在美国的爱尔兰人有时能找到某种令人无法抗拒的方式发出邀请，有位名为麦隆内的女士给玛丽写了封信：“我的博士父亲经常说，人类取得的小小成就不容夸大。但夫人，这二十年来您在我心中的形象一直很伟大，我只想与您见个面，哪怕只有几分钟。”这其实说的是：“小猫能有荣幸面见女王吗？” 玛丽一反常态，回复道：“好的。”

于是五月的某个清晨，麦隆内女士就坐在了研究所小小的会客厅里。她后来描述道：

“房间门开了，我看见一位瘦削苍白的女士走了进来，脸上尽显悲伤。她当时穿着一条黑棉裙。她耐心而和善的面庞上闪现出学识渊博的人特有的超然物外。我突然觉得自己打扰到了她的生活，我甚至比居里夫人本人还要羞涩。我做职业记者已有二十多年了，但在那一刻，面对这位毫无防备之心的女士，我什么都问不出。”

玛丽后来谈到了美国和镭元素，这也舒缓了女记者紧张的情绪。玛丽告诉她自己知道美国有五十克镭元素，她也清楚地知道每座城市拥有的镭元素量。“那法国有多少克呢？” 麦隆内女士问道。

“我的实验室里也只有一克多一点。”

“您只有一克镭元素？”

“我？我一克都没有。这克镭元素属于实验室。”

随后，麦隆内女士谈到了专利问题。她猜想，玛丽肯定能从那些使用自己的镭元素提炼方法的人身上赚取大笔财富。

“镭不能成为任何人谋求财富的手段，” 玛丽说，“它是一种元素，属于全人类。”

麦隆内女士当时肯定觉得凭玛丽为人类做出的贡献，整个世界都应回报她。她突然问道：“如果您能问全世界要一件需要的东西，您会选择什么？”

玛丽犹豫了片刻，回答说：“我需要一克镭，以便继续进行自己的实验研究。但我买不起。镭元素对我来说太昂贵了。”

麦隆内女士当即认为美国应该赠予玛丽·居里一克镭元素。她回到家，试图游说十位富有的女性每人捐赠三千法郎，但最后只说服了三位。她之后又去游说劳苦大众。美国所有的女性都应该联合起来，让玛丽获得这份礼物。不到一年，她就给玛丽写信说：“我们筹集到了钱。你很快就能得到那克镭元素。”

整个美国都为这项活动而激动不已。很快所有的女性都得知了居里夫人镭元素基金的存在，大家都想见见居里夫人。然而玛丽不喜欢在人前讲话。她其实不想去，但又觉得对不起这份弥足珍贵的礼物。不过她一开始还是找了很多理由。比如，她不能和女儿们分开。这丝毫不影响美国人民的热情好客，她的女儿们也获得了邀请，而且将由总统本人将镭元素赠予玛丽。

于是，玛丽、艾琳和伊芙把所有的衣服塞进大箱子，应邀搭乘奥林匹克号邮轮，坐在高级客舱里前往美国。法国也在歌剧院举办了盛大的欢送会，著名演员莎拉·贝恩哈特和吉瑞斯都参与了演出。唯有大西洋显得不太友好，海面黑沉，让玛丽开始怀念家乡阳光普照的蓝色海湾。

奥林匹克号靠岸时，与玛丽她们同行的麦隆内女士陪同着玛丽走出客舱，迎接美国式的欢迎仪式，唯有亲身经历过的人才懂得这热情好客背后的真情实意。人群等待了整整五个小时，来迎接被他们称作“人类恩人”的伟大女性。时值夏季，蓝天白云下，高耸着亮丽的摩天大楼。码头上充斥着各色国旗，波兰的、法国的、美国的。学生们，年轻女孩们，和三百位在美国的波兰女性代表捧着红色白色的玫瑰迎接她们。玛丽就像小学生一样端坐在甲板的轮椅上，麦隆内女士拿着她的帽子和手包，把她推到相机镜头前。“头向右偏些，居里夫人。”“再往这边来点……”

美国热情欢迎。美国人要让世界都明白，科学家是最伟大的人。他们被玛丽对纯粹科学的虔诚追求、对金钱的清心寡欲以及服务人类的坚定信条深深触动。

他们无法为玛丽再授予任何殊荣，这并不重要。美国各地的人都想一睹她的芳容，却忽视了国家幅员辽阔而造成的交通时间。他们为玛丽举办了盛大的欢迎宴，宾客多达五百人，尽情欢乐，忘却时间。他们授予玛丽大量的荣誉头衔，但却忘记玛丽在自己的国家早就拒绝了这类嘉奖。他们邀请玛丽参加大学的仪式，惊讶地发现她竟然没有长袍和帽子。他们给玛丽送来了精心培育的鲜花，却忘记了她最喜欢自然生长的花朵。爱就是这样，玛丽尽管被折腾得筋疲力尽，但她能理解。唯一无法包容的，就是他们为她量身定做的各式各样的学院长袍。希望玛丽穿上丝织长袍本身就不现实，丝绸会弄疼她早已被镭元素灼伤的手指。

玛丽首先参观了女子大学。无论她走到哪里，穿着白色校服的女孩们都挤满了道路，或快跑穿过操场来追赶玛丽乘坐的马车。白色的人群中还有人挥舞着彩色的旗帜。在纽约，大学女生们排着长长的队伍，为玛丽献上法国百合和美国玫瑰。另一队是各国大使及重要人物，他们将玛丽称作“纽约的自由女神”，另一位获此殊荣的波兰人是音乐家帕德雷夫斯基。很多年前，在他还是一名穷困潦倒的钢琴家时，玛丽曾为他拍手喝彩。

随后是盛大的赠予仪式：赠送镭元素。

华盛顿白宫亲自筹备这一仪式。美国总统和各界政要都在等待会见玛丽，但独不见镭元素。它太珍贵也太危险了，不能放在桌上或是总统手里。它被安全地存放在工厂里，总统手里拿的不过是个替代品。赠予仪式期间，东边房间桌子上摆的不过是镭元素的仿制品。

四点钟，两扇门同时打开，人群缓缓进入，玛丽挽着哈定总统的手臂走进会场。

总统发表欢迎词，他表示玛丽不仅仅是位伟大的科学家，更是一位尽心尽职的妻子和母亲。她不仅像男性一样完成了自己的日常工作，还额外履行了女性职责。

致辞结束后，总统颁给玛丽一张证书，并将镭元素箱子的金钥匙挂在玛丽的脖子上。在蓝色的会场上，玛丽安静地坐着，宾客排着队同艾琳和伊芙一一握手，因为玛丽已经太累了。

玛丽终于得到了一克镭元素！而过程一点也不容易。在赠予仪式的前一晚，麦隆内女士将证书交给玛丽，她却一直坚持不管多晚都要请律师来公证这克镭元素是属于实验室的。当麦隆内女士建议一周后再进行公证时，玛丽严肃地说道：“也许今晚我就会离世！” 从那晚起，镭元素正式归实验室所有，玛丽只是有权用之进行实验。

还有很多参观活动。美国因让客人筋疲力尽而深感愧疚，试尽一切方法让玛丽消除疲劳。有时他们特意安排玛丽在目的地前一站下车，等早就守候在车站的兴奋人群发现这一点时，他们又纷纷开着车去追赶这位客人。有时，玛丽不得已在火车的另一边下车，跳到铁轨上，穿过轨道，但其实没什么作用。有时艾琳和伊芙也想代替母亲出现，但当教授们同年仅十六岁的伊芙谈论起“伟大发现”和“毕生工作”时，人群根本无法满足。

但当芝加哥的波兰人为玛丽举办欢迎盛会时，玛丽还是如期赴约了。对他们来说，玛丽就是远方祖国的象征，她的成就是属于波兰的。男男女女的面庞都被喜悦的泪水打湿，纷纷跪在玛丽脚边亲吻她的双脚和裙边。

六月底，玛丽搭乘奥林匹克号重返巴黎，镭元素被锁在邮轮精密的保险箱里。在玛丽的信中，丝毫未提及镭元素，更多描述的是她内心的愉悦，她终于能为法国和波兰赢得美国的一丝友善。

在美国受到的热情礼遇让玛丽认识到她对世界来说有多重要。她意识到单单是自己的名字、自己的出现就能帮助她在意和热爱的事物。于是她开始更多地到各地参观拜访，出席庆祝仪式和会议。她已经名扬四海。她去过南美洲、西班牙、英国和捷克斯洛伐克。即便在她没到访过的中国，在一座孔子庙里，居里夫人的肖像也和佛像、天朝皇帝的头像摆在一起。

每次旅途中，玛丽都能看到新奇事儿。她喜欢看到鱼儿跳出水面，在空中划过一道弧线，在赤道附近人根本看不到自己的影子，这也让她兴奋不已，她喜欢在陌生地方遇见的各色野花。

但除了能看到自己喜爱的事物之外，每一次出访玛丽也都在为自己热爱追寻的事业而努力奋斗。同任何热爱世界、服务人类的人一样，玛丽痛恨战争。她愿意在战争中履行士兵的义务，为国家而战。但在和平年代，她更愿意努力避免更多战争的发生。她不愿意浪费科研时间参加各种协会活动，但唯有一个例外：她被国际联盟行政院提名为协会成员，成员们都立志于促进不同国家间的相互协作。这个协会也被称作“国际智力合作委员会”。玛丽不想只在协会中动动嘴皮子，她想确切做些实事。有成员致力于让所有国家的科研人员都使用相同的科研术语，制作关于世界上所有科学书籍和科学发现的完整清单，这样学生们就知道科学界已经取得了哪些成就。

此外，玛丽希望能建立一种机制，帮助各国具有科学天赋但却穷困潦倒的科学家们发挥自己的才能。她认为对天才放任不理是世界上最可怕的资源浪费。她竭尽所能创造一个自由、和平和科学发展越来越迅速的世界。既然巴黎的镭研究所已经正常运作了，玛丽还想在华沙也建立一个镭元素研究所。她的姐姐布朗尼娅就在波兰，能帮助她实施这一想法。很快，波兰举国上下就贴满了公告；所有的邮局都开始出售印有玛丽头像的邮票；明信片上都印有“为玛丽·斯克沃多夫斯卡·居里研究所的建设添砖加瓦吧”这样的邀请，上面还有玛丽的笔迹：“我真切地希望能在华沙建立镭元素研究所。”

1925年，玛丽回到了华沙，参加研究所奠基仪式。波兰共和国总统垒下了第一块砖，玛丽垒下了第二块。他笑着问玛丽是否还记得自己穷困潦倒时玛丽送给他的睡枕。她回答道：“当然，不过您忘还了。”她也清楚地记得当年那个著名的演员在舞台上给她的问候，那个人就是科塔宾斯基先生，玛丽曾给他送了顶用野花编制的花环。

但镭研究所要是没了镭元素就显得有些可笑。麦隆内女士又成功说服美国给玛丽送了一克镭元素，玛丽也因此再次赴美。但这一次是以波兰的名义感谢美国。她待在白宫，看见到处都是象的雕塑，有大象、小象、小小象、白象，觉得很有意思。作为临别礼物，玛丽获赠两头象，一头象牙制的小象和一头几乎看不见的小象。大象是执政党的徽标。带着两个象雕和镭元素，玛丽回到华沙，看到研究所已经正常运转，开始医治病人。

同当年小女孩时一样，玛丽沿着维斯瓦河散步，并写下：

“河流蜿蜒，河面宽阔，河水缓缓，近处是灰色，远处如天空般碧蓝。美丽的沙滩在太阳下金光闪闪，勾勒出河流蜿蜒的轮廓。在河岸边，明亮的光线显示出水深的地方。我只想在这波光粼粼的河岸边漫步……有首歌唱的是：‘波兰的河水魅力无边，一旦爱上便永远爱上。’对我来说这千真万确。这条伟大的河流有一种不能言说的魅力。”





第十九章　度假


布列塔尼有个地方，粉色的花岗岩峭壁绵延伸向蔚蓝清澈的大海，海面平静，周围数千座小岛将大西洋的滚滚波浪隔挡在外。岩石深处有个地方叫拉尔库埃，坐落着渔民们的房屋，不算是村庄，顶多就是个小村落，布列塔尼的卖鱼妇们都戴着宽帽檐的白色亚麻帽，躲避海风的吹拂。

玛丽的度假山庄就坐落在荒野高处，风中一条清晰的小路直通屋门，远看就像一座灯塔，虽然是座破旧的村舍，但视野开阔，风景优美。在拉尔库埃，没有人认识玛丽。村长是个有些驼背、个子不高的老人，眼镜后是一双笑眯眯的眼睛，他住的房子就是一座又长又低的村舍，从上到下都用藤蔓覆盖，周围种着红色的吊钟花，让游客赏心悦目。房屋坐落在果园里，叫作塔什维翰，在布列塔尼这个名字的意思是“小果园”。大门经常敞开，除了东风肆意的季节，这位“老国王”的宾客们——玛丽、艾琳、伊芙、弗雷德里克·约里奥、孩子们、科学家和作家们——事实上，“国王”受所有人的爱戴，宾客们在他身边待了一整天，但没想过“国王”本人就是当今世界上知识最渊博的历史学家之一，虽不及查尔斯·瑟诺博斯那样知名。他发现了拉尔库埃，每年夏天，巴黎最博学、最聪明的学者都会来此度假。

每天清晨，玛丽都会戴着褪了色的亚麻帽子，穿着旧短裙、凉鞋以及拉尔库埃人穿的黑色双排扣夹克衫，像渔民和卖鱼妇一样，沿着陡峭的山路从原野上走下来，走到塔什维翰花团锦簇的花园里。

“早上好，居里夫人。”瑟诺博斯说道。

“早上好！”十五个左右躺在青草鲜花间的人异口同声说道，他们穿着如同吉卜赛人。

玛丽将帆布包放在地上，坐在包旁。拉尔库埃像其他地方一样，也有严重的社会分化，但和大部分村庄也不太一样。在拉尔库埃，底层民众被称作菲利斯人。对拉尔库埃来说，他们是外来人、陌生人。再上一级可能你听过，是“大象”。对拉尔库埃来说，他们是朋友，但也是不幸的“旱鸭子”，他们在海上没有在陆地上感觉那么舒服。他们值得同情，同时也值得帮助。再之上，是本地受人尊敬的水手们，而远在他们之上的贵族们就是“鳄鱼”，他们了解海洋的一切，他们不仅会游泳，还能“爬水”，在最急的浪潮中都能扬帆划桨。玛丽从未做过菲利斯，也不可能成为鳄鱼一族。她起初是大象，正努力成为水手。

瑟诺博斯让水手们从船舰上拖下来两艘帆船、六艘划桨船，停在码头上，还有小艇和游船，用船桨将它们划到岩石栈台。

瑟诺博斯喊道：“快上船！快上船！我要划船了，居里夫人来划桨，佩林和波莱尔划小艇，弗朗西斯掌舵。”

船员都是教授。白绿相间的小船在原地转圈，因为有人划得太使劲儿。舵手命令船员们注意：“船桨没跟上节奏。” 玛丽脸色绯红，认真调整着自己划桨的节奏。海水在太阳下微波浮荡，水手们唱道：

三个男孩划船上岛

船上充满了欢声笑语

小岛也在等着三个男孩

……

唱完第三首歌，也要换桨了，因为身强力壮的船员要带他们穿过浪花前往罗斯福莱斯，紫罗兰色的小岛，拉尔库埃人都在这里游泳。男孩就在海岸上换衣服，旁边是棕色的海鸥，女士们则到岩石后面用绿草搭建的更衣室里换泳衣。

玛丽第一个跳到了清澈的海水中。她虽然不会爬水，但很擅长游泳。在水中她仿佛又年轻了，白头发都藏在泳帽下，也没人能注意到她的皱纹。她身材修长优雅，姿势敏捷，并对自己的技艺颇为骄傲。“我可比波莱尔游得要好。”她对艾琳喊道。艾琳可不会阿谀奉承，她只会实话实说：“是的妈妈，你游得太好啦。无与伦比。”

游完泳，玛丽晒着日光浴，吃了一片面包。“太惬意了，”她低声说道，“多美好呀。” 即便是玛丽·居里也无须多言拉尔库埃的美。没什么必要。拉尔库埃是世界上最美的地方，这众人皆知。

中午，伴着船员们的歌声，他们回到家中。玛丽光着脚，光着腿，手中提着凉鞋，抓着短裙，踩着黑泥慢慢踱到岸边，成群的白海鸥在岸边休憩。

一群人在家中用过午饭，随后下午两点钟大部分人回到塔什维翰花园里，准备搭乘汽艇野玫瑰号。这些汽艇和船只都属于瑟诺博斯。他拥有一切，但他更喜欢和朋友们分享一切。玛丽不会玩帆船，她觉得坐汽艇也是个漫长的过程。于是，她坐在自己如灯塔般的家中批改科学论文，或者拿着铁锹、铲子和修枝剪在花园里修修剪剪。荆棘划破了她的皮肤，岩石让她扭伤了脚腕，有时又会被锤子砸到手指，但她对这些小事并不在意。下午六点钟，她重新回到沙滩上晒太阳，来到塔什维翰花园陪伴年迈的老妇人，等待野玫瑰号的归程。在落日的余晖下，帆船在晚饭前刚好回到了岸边，快乐的船员们走进塔什维翰花园，女孩们头上都别着瑟诺博斯每天送给她们的粉色康乃馨。

吃过晚饭，大家都走到了塔什维翰花园敞开的大门旁。有时，还会玩一些简单的猜词或者猜字谜游戏。有时也会踢球。有时又会拉响手风琴，演奏旧式舞蹈的乐曲，所有人——无论是科学家还是村民，无论是主人还是仆人——大家共同舞蹈。

有时夜晚月光明朗，玛丽和艾琳、伊芙就会手挽手沿着海边蜿蜒的小路散步。突然吹来的海风中夹杂着浪花拍打礁石的声音，也让玛丽想到她的放射性元素镭，它难道不就如同大海一般，神秘而危险？拉尔库埃距离潘波很近。拉尔库埃人一整天都在波光粼粼的海边玩耍，但潘波人是冰岛渔民，最了解海洋的神秘与危险。

每年度假，玛丽都会来到波光粼粼的海边。工作时，她专心研究镭元素。她沉浸在镭元素的射线中，这灼伤了她的皮肤，因为她让别人穿上厚重的铅服，而自己却脱掉了。这也对她的血液产生了不好的影响。即便是法国最著名的医生都束手无策。

1934年7月4日，夏季的一天，玛丽在桑塞罗摩疗养院去世，死于一种不知名的疾病，后来医生们猜想，这定与她长期接触她的伟大发现——镭元素——有关。

Author's Foreword


THE life of Madame Curie has been written by her daughter with a charm and beauty never surpassed. It is therefore with the deepest humility that I have ventured to make out of that lovely book a shorter tale for young people.

People ought not to wait till they are over sixteen to make the acquaintance of the greatest and most delightful human beings and to hear of the world's greatest deeds. Yet complete biographies are necessarily lengthy and are often written in words familiar only to those of much experience and many years.

I hope therefore that The Radium Woman and Robert Gibbings's beautiful woodcuts may help the younger members of a family to share the keen delight that their elders are taking in the life of Madame Curie and that it will promptthem to vow: “We will not let ourselves be deprived of a word or a hint concerning that wonderful woman. We will also read Eve Curie's Madame Curie.”

ELEANOR DOORLY.

Warwick. March, 1939.





Chapter I　Manya Singing


WHY not? Why not? Why not? Why shouldn't Manya be allowed to read? She didn't ask the question. She would not think of asking her gentle, beautiful mother why not; she only puzzled her own little stubborn head where a pair of bright, grey-blue eyes looked penetratingly out from under a shock of yellow hair.

It was always like that! She had only to say: “Mayn't I read?” or to put out a hand towards a book and someone would be sure to say: “Manya dear, run into the garden” or “You haven't been to see your doll all day” or “Build me a house with those lovely new blocks.” Manya knew all their wiles. Reading was naughty—naughty for her, but not for Bronia; and yet she could read and Bronia couldn't. It was very puzzling and apparently all the fault of the day when she had snatched a book from Bronia. She hadn't meant anything wrong. Bronia had asked her to play with the cardboard letters when they had nothing to do in their uncle's orchard except lie on the grass and move the bits of cardboard into words. Then one day, after they came home, their father had said to Bronia: “Let's see how the reading has got on.” Bronia had stood with the open book, spelling the words and stumbling over them. So Manya had seized it from her and read! “Manya!” her mother had exclaimed, surprised and shocked and her father had looked solemn while Bronia had sulked. There had been nothing for Manya to do but to cry and sob out: “Beg pardon... Manya didn't mean it.”

Since that day no reading had been allowed, so Manya stood hesitating at her mother's door wondering what she should do. All morning she had been carrying ammunition for Bronia across the long dormitory floor in the great war against Joseph's and Hela's fort. The fort was built of the new blocks and the ammunition consisted of blocks also and she had grown too hot and tired, so that game had been stopped as far as she was concerned. There was nothing for it but to find her elder sister and go into the garden. “Zosia!… Zosia!” she called through the house and the two went off hand in hand. Zosia was twelve and almost grown up in the eyes of the other four, who were Joseph, Hela, Bronia, aged eight, and Manya. Manya was four when she learned to read and five on the day we are talking about, which explains why she was not allowed to read. Monsieur and Madame Sklodovski did not want their clever little girl pressed. But it had not occurred to them to tell her the reason.

The garden was big, level and walled in, with a rather worn grass patch and lots of trees. In much of it they could play to their hearts' content, but they had to be careful what they did on their way out and in, because they had to pass the windows of an Ogre. The garden belonged to the boys' High School, and in the school both the Sklodovskis and the Ogre lived. Even Zosia was nervous when she had to pass those windows and lowered her voice to a whisper, telling her little sister to be quite silent while they tip-toed past.

Although she was only five, Manya already knew quite a number of things. She knew that the Ogre was an ogre because he belonged to the people who had cut her own country into three parts and shared them out, like a giant dividing his spoil with two other giants. She was a Polish child and the ogre was the Russian Director of the school in which her father taught Mathematics and Physics. He was there to see that all the Polish men, women and children pretended properly to be Russian and Manya knew that with such people you had to be on your guard, careful and quiet so as not to be caught.

There was another thing that Manya knew very well: the country was a lovely place, though she lived in the town. In the country there were crowds and crowds and uncles and aunts and cousins; there was a stream to paddle in and mud to make mud pies and plenty of sun to cook the delectable cakes. There was the old lime tree that seven cousins sat in, eating gooseberries from cool cabbage leaves. When she appeared they would hoist her up to their crooked perch and make a collection for her from each of the seven cabbage leaves. In July, Manya was a wild little peasant.

Then there was her mother. Manya knew that she loved her more than anything else in the world. She was very beautiful, so it was not surprising that Manya thought so, or that she loved her beautiful singing. She loved, too, her mother's odd little way of stroking her hair and her forehead when she went to bed, instead of kissing her and when, in the evening all the family knelt around the table and prayed “Pray God make our mother better,” Manya never supposed it was because her mother was ill or that that had anything to do with not being kissed.

Manya had been born on November the 7th, 1867, and named Marya, but she was more often called Manya or Manyusia—or oftenest of all, a strange pet name, Anciupecio, for in Poland they love nicknames. Zosia had spent the time in the garden telling her a long story about Anciupecio, because Zosia told stories better than anybody else and often made up gay little plays which she acted for her brother and sisters, taking all the parts herself. So real were those plays that Manya used to laugh and shudder by turns and not be quite sure in which country she lived or who were the people next door or who the people in the story.

When they reached the house, they found that their father had. just finished school and was sitting in his study, the largest, happiest room in the house. The two entered very quietly. There sat their mother making a pair of shoes for Manya. Creak, creak went the scissors, cutting through the hard leather. Snap, snap crackled the waxed thread as it tightened and grew taut between the layers, and clack, clack tapped the hammer on the nails. Madame Sklodovski's thin white hands were nimble and cunning even at such hard work as that—and they needed to be, because five children wear out a mighty deal of shoe leather in a year.

That evening their father was talking about the Ogre. He often talked about him. The Ogre meant much to the family and was going to mean more. He had recently punished a Polish boy savagely for making a grammatical mistake in Russian, which is one of the hardest of foreign languages, and Monsieur Sklodovski had not been able to resist the temptation of saying: “But you too, sir, though you are a Russian by birth, sometimes make a grammatical mistake in that language.” The Ogre did not at once retort. He glowered and scowled, but he saved up his revenge for another year.

Manya wandered round her father's room, straight little nose in the air, dreamily thinking her own thoughts, touching her pet ornaments, keeping carefully from disturbing her brother and sisters, who were doing their homework around their father's big, flat-topped desk. Manya was not at all interested in the splendid picture of a bishop which hung on the wall; it was said to be by a famous painter, but that was not the kind of thing she liked. She loved the clock on the desk and stayed a long time peering into its face and listening to its loud tick, tock. Then she ran her fingers daintily along the smooth marble top of the many-coloured Sicilian table; she liked that too, but not the whatnot with its blue Sèvres cup. She drew herself carefully away from that as the thing was breakable and something terrible might happen if she touched it. Not so the next treasures; they were more friendly and more mysterious with lovely, long, incomprehensible names—the barometer hanging on the wall which her father examined and tapped so seriously every day under the children's watchful eyes; the glass cupboard containing glass tubes and delicate balances and minerals and a goldleaf electroscope. “What... ?” Manya began one day.

“What are those?” interrupted her father in a solemn, teasing voice, “Those are physical apparatus.”

Little did he think…! Little did Manya think what was going to happen to her and physical apparatus, but she liked the odd sounding words and ran off chanting:

Phýs-ˇ-cˇal áp-pˇar-á-tús.

Phýs-ˇ-cˇal áp-pˇar-á-tús.





Chapter II　Manya Learning


MANYA'S school was an odd place and she learned odd things: how, for instance, to do what one is forbidden to do; how to hide one's disobedience quickly; how to seem to be doing what one isn't; how to diddle government inspectors; and because Manya was cleverer than most children, she was soon doing all these things better than the others. But the queerest thing of all in that school was that her form mistress and the headmistress found her a great help and not, as you might have thought, a great nuisance.

One day her class of twenty-five were having a delicious history lesson—a much more delicious history lesson than English children have ever had because it was a forbidden lesson. All the twenty-five and their mistress knew it was forbidden.

There they sat, the twelve year olds. Manya, aged only ten, was in the third row, near the high window looking out on to the snowy lawn. All the twenty-five were in navy blue with steel buttons and white collars, their hair tightly plaited and tied behind their ears with a neat tight bow. Their ears were all stretched, left ear listening hard for every word of history, right ear quick to catch the first tinkle of a certain door bell—conspirators all! Mistress and pupils were waiting, working, waiting to be caught!

Manya was in the middle of answering a question… Her mistress liked her to answer as she was always top in history, top too in arithmetic, literature, German and French. On this occasion she was telling what she had learned of the Polish king, Stanislas Auguste.

“He was elected King of Poland,” said she, “in 1764. He was a clever, highly educated king, a friend of poets and artists. He understood the causes of Poland's weakness and tried to make her strong, but alas, he had no courage...” Even Manya knew that a king should have courage and her voice was full of fierce regret, the fierce regret of a ten year old, who understood quite a lot. Tang—, tang—, ting, ting. Everybody shivered once. Everybody moved quickly, absolutely silently. Tupcia, as they called their mistress, piled her Polish books, every child piled her exercise books and her Polish history. The five whose duty it was, gathered all the books into their aprons and carried them with all speed to the boarders' bedrooms. The rest got out their needlework and were making exquisite buttonholes in cotton squares as if they had never done anything else.

The Russian inspector came in, accompanied by the unhappy headmistress, who had not been able to prevent his walking fast, and was in a panic lest the warning bell, with its two long rings and two short, had not given the children time to hide their disobedience. But there was no sign of anything but needlework, except that perhaps five little girls looked rather hot and breathless. But a man would not notice that.

Monsieur Hornberg, the inspector, sat down heavily. He was a fine looking man in spite of his fat and his shaved head. His uniform helped him with its yellow trousers and blue jacket fastened with well-polished silver buttons. In silence, he looked piercingly at the children through his gold-rimmed glasses and glanced swiftly at the book Tupcia had laid open on the desk with a bored air.

“You were reading aloud while they worked?” he questioned. “What is the book?”

“Krylov's Fairy Tales. We have just begun it to-day.”

M. Hornberg knew that Russian book well and sincerely approved of it. He opened one of the desks and found it tidily empty. The button-holing had stopped and the children were politely waiting for his words of wisdom. It was not he who would have the eyes to see in their motionless faces the fear, the cleverness, the hatred that was there behind their solemn eyes.

“Mademoiselle, call up one of those young people, please.”

Tupcia was relieved; she couId choose one who would not make a hash of things. The one, however, was praying not to be called up. “Don't let it be me, God, please God…” She did not hear God say: “Marya Sklodovska, the world is waiting for you to learn to do disagreeable things greatly.” She did hear Tupcia call Marya Sklodovska!

She got up, turned hot, turned cold; shame clutched at her young throat.

“Say the Lord's Prayer,” ordered Hornberg.

Manya obeyed, saying it in Russian as the foreign ruler bade, not in Latin, according to the custom of her own religion.

“Mention the Czars of Holy Russia since Catherine II.”

“Catherine II, Paul I, Alexander I, Nicolas I, Alexander II,” recited Manya in perfect Russian as if she had been born in St. Petersburg.

“And the names and titles of the Czar's family.”

“Her Majesty, the Empress, His Imperial Highness, the Czarevitch Alexander, His Imperial Highness, the Grand Duke...”

“Good! Who governs us?”

Manya hesitated.

“Who governs us?” repeated the inspector, irritated.

“His Majesty, Alexander II, Czar of all the Russias,” stammered Manya, turning pale.

The inspection was over and the inspector gone, very well satisfied with what he had seen and heard and feeling that he was making a real success of his department. But Manya broke down and cried as if her heart would break.

At the end of school, outside in the street, the excited children had a tale to tell their aunts and mothers and nurses who had come to fetch them; but in whispers they told it, for they knew only too well that any passer-by, any lounger, might be a spy, who would repeat to the government what even a child said.

Hela and Manya took their Aunt Lucia by each arm. “The inspector questioned Manya,” whispered Hela. “She answered like a brick, but cried like a baby afterwards. Anyway, the inspector hadn't any fault to find with anybody.”

Manya held her tongue. She hated it all—hated being afraid, hated being made to feel that she belonged to an enslaved nation, hated having to lie, to lie all the time. As she clung to her aunt's arm, she remembered all the things she hated: the Ogre who had managed to turn her father out of his professorship. That had made them so that they were obliged to have students lodging in their house, which was horrid and often made them uncomfortable and unhappy. But that happiness was as nothing in comparison with not having Zosia any more, Zosia to tell her tales, Zosia to listen to all she had to say. Zosia had caught typhus from one of the students and had gone away for ever.

Across the sunny, snowy park the three made their way to the old town of Warsaw with its narrow streets and high, sloping-roofed houses ringed with snow. From unexpected comers, odd little sculptures looked out, Virgins' faces or strange stone animals.

Suddenly, the old church bells clanged out above their heads, clear and noisy in the frosty air. There were quite a crowd of churches just there and Aunt Lucia drew the children in through the dark door of one where they used to go to mass years before. How could Manya go in now, without Zosia? But she went in, because there was a colder fear than any other in her heart now and she wanted to persuade God to let her mother get better. “Let mother get better,” she prayed. “Let me die instead of mother, please, God.”

Out in the crisp winter air again Aunt Lucia had a treat to propose: they were to go down to the Vistula to buy the household apples from the market boats. Forgetting their sorrows, the children ran down the long steps that led to the river. The great Vistula rolled its yellowish, sombre vastness around low sandy islands, great empty barges slowly heaved against one another, sometimes thudding with a low sound into the floating baths and wash-houses at the bank. Only around the two long apple barges was there life in that winter season, for they had come from far up the river to bring red, rosy joy to children in Warsaw. The master, cosy in his sheepskin coat, swaying as he moved about the craft, lifted the straw here and there to show the purchasers how red and polished and free from frost his merchandise was in spite of its many days' journeying down the Vistula.

Hela first, then Manya threw down muff and satchel and began excitedly choosing their own apples, piling them in the great wicker basket that was to carry them home, throwing any bad ones they had the luck to find far far out into the river, seeing who could throw the furthest.

Then Aunt Lucia engaged a boy to carry home the basket and marched her charges off the boat, each munching the reddest of all the apples.

At home at five o'clock, there was a meal of something more substantial than apples and then homework round the big desk. Soon a loud murmur rose from those aggravating people who do lessons aloud, a trying custom in other lands besides Poland. Those children had to learn their lessons in Russian. Mathematics in Russian for Polish children were even harder than usual. French and German grammar was all in Russian and words they did not know had to be looked up in Russian dictionaries. They might, of course, explain their difficulties to themselves in Polish, but when the next morning came they had to say the lesson in Russian and to go through a geometrical problem in a foreign language. They had to write their essays in a tongue not their own and to read French directly into Russian. Learning was a hard matter.

But Manya was a witch. She knew things by magic without learning them; she had to read her Russian verses only twice to know them without a mistake, lucky scrap! But she was also a kind-hearted scrap, for when her homework was done under time, she would help other people through their maze of difficulty. Not always, though. If she got a chance, she would put a book between her elbows on the table, her hands over her ears to keep out Hela's recitation, and… read! When Manya read, there was no waking her from her absorption; she heard nothing. A whole household might plan to tease and make a noise like all the zoos let loose with tin cans to play with and yet Manya wouldn't hear till her book was done. That was concentration and it was a joyful gift to have seized from the lucky-bag of life.

Once the others built a scaffolding of chairs round her as she read, a chair on each side, a chair behind and on top, three more chairs and so on over her head. She didn't hear or see a shadow of a chair or builder. She didn't hear delighted whispering or stifled laughter. When she had finished, she raised her head and down came the whole edifice amid shouts of laughter from the others. That didn't please Manya. She rubbed a bruised shoulder and went into another room, flashing at her elders as she passed just: “That's silly!”

When bedtime came, the Sklodovski girls slept on skins in the dining-room because the bedrooms had to be given to the students who paid. In the night the skins used to slip off and leave them cold. In the morning they had to get up in the dark because the dining-room had to be ready for the students' breakfast.

But such things as that were of no importance to Manya. Her mother was growing more and more ill, even she could see that. She prayed to God always, but He seemed not to listen to ten year old Manya. And in the spring, in May, before she was eleven, her mother slipped away, whispering to her little girl: “I love you.”

Manya was learning very much; was learning that life asks for courage from nations and men and children, not only from kings. She had thoughts of her own about it all. It seemed to her unjust and cruel and not at all to be understood. She was headstrong and angry and not at all submissive.





Chapter III　Rebels


MANYA at fourteen was not yet as pretty as her sisters. Bronia was quite grown up with long sweeping skirts and her golden hair done up into a bun at the back. She had taken her mother's place and looked after the housekeeping and the lodgers. Hela was sixteen and a beauty, fair and tall and graceful. Joseph was also fair and tall and handsome. He was at the university studying medicine.

The girls would have liked to think of themselves as going to the university also, but in Russian Poland no woman was allowed to go to any university. If they wanted to learn more than they learned at school, they had to get their learning from books for themselves or in another country.

For the moment, Manya was content for herself. She had gone on to the High School and was as happy as a squirrel with all the nuts it needed; but she was worried about Bronia. What would Bronia do without a university? Couldn't she, Manya, invent a scheme to get Bronia to some country where girls could learn what they wanted to know? She made up her mind to work and earn money to keep her elder sister. Well, the high road to earning was to get through school successfully! Manya, that particular morning, would be late for school unless she finished breakfast quickly, cut up the sandwiches for school lunch, saved, yes saved, the meat from Lancet who had interrupted her thoughts by a quick grab at the last of the mutton which was waiting to be cut up for those sandwiches. Lancet was the red setter, the adored of the household. He was very beautiful and did everything he shouldn't. He had golden feathers on ears and tail and feet and should have been a most obedient shooting dog, but he had had no education. Manya, her brother and sisters spoilt him all day, kissed him, even made a lap dog of him. He slept in the chairs, brushed vases down with his tail, ate other people's lunch, upset visitors with his uproarious welcome, took their hats and gloves for them with the politest air—gloves and hats that looked sadly the worse for wear when they were returned to their owners.

At last lunch having been safely wrapped up, her satchel slung on her back and Lancet persuaded to stay at home, Manya ran off to school.

At the blue palace where Count Zamoyski lived, she stopped, hesitated before the great bronze lion guarding one of its old stone courtyards and put her hand on the heavy ring in its mouth to turn it over its nose.

“Don't run away, Manyusia,” called a voice from a window; “Kazia'll be there in a minute.” Manya always picked up Kazia, who was the daughter of the Count's librarian, on her way to school; but if her friend were late, she turned the bronze ring up and went on. Then Kazia could be in no doubt whether she had passed.

“Come to tea this afternoon,” called Kazia's mother; “there'll be your favourite iced chocolate.”

“Of course you're coming to tea,” said Kazla. “Oh! Aren't we late? Come on!”

So the two hurried along the narrow street and through the park, neither of them conscious of the difference everyone else could see in them. Kazia was so well dressed, so obviously the petted daughter of two devoted parents, while Manya was a little left to herself, a little shabby.

It was a long way to school and they had plenty of time for chatter, time too to play certain games. In the wet weather they made a point of trailing their goloshes through the deepest parts of the puddles; in the dry, they played the “green” game.

“Do come to the shops and buy a new exercise book,” said Manya. I have seen some awfully jolly ones with green covers that will…”

But Kazia wasn't caught. At the word green and before Manya could finish her sentence she handed her a piece of green velvet she was keeping ready for the purpose in her pocket. She escaped a forfeit and for the moment nothing more followed. Manya seemed to have given up the game. She began talking about their last history lesson in which the professor had gone out of his way to tell them that Poland was a mere province of Russia and the Polish language a Patois.

“Still he seemed uncomfortable,” she remarked. “Did you see that he dared not look at us and turned quite pale?”

“Yes!” said Kazia; “he was almost green.” And immediately, she saw Manya twiddling a young green chestnut leaf under her nose.

“We've passed the monument!” a cry of horror from Manya. “Oh, well! We've got to go back”; and back they went right to Saxe Square where there was a lofty column supported by four lions. On it was written “To the Poles faithful to their Monarch.” The Czars had erected the monument to those Poles who, traitors to their own country, had died fighting on the side of the oppressor. It had become the duty of all Poles who were faithful to Poland to spit at the monument every time they passed it and Manya and Kazia would not leave that duty undone even if it meant retracing their steps or being late for school.

“Are you coming to watch the dancing tonight?” asked Manya. Naturally Kazia was going. Every week a few families met to dance at the Sklodovskis; but only the girls who were “out” were allowed to dance. Kazia and Manya were obliged to sit still and watch. Nevertheless they were getting hints of how to do it, studying the steps, discussing the movements, learning the tunes; and when the grown-up dancing was over, they practised by themselves.

They were eagerly discussing the joys of coming out as they walked under the school archway into the courtyard. Girls from every direction were trooping into the great bare, three-storied building; there were laughter and chatter and gaiety and many greetings. But one girl was hurrying in alone as if she wished to escape notice. As the two caught her up, they saw that her eyes were swollen and red and her clothes were untidy as if she had scrambled into them anyhow.

“What's the matter with Kunicka?” they asked one another and one of them slipped an arm round the girl.

“What's the matter, Kunicka?”

Kunicka could scarcely answer, her pale face was drawn with pain. “It's my brother,” she stammered. “He's been caught in a plot… For three days we hadn't had any news of him…They're... they're going to hang him at dawn to-morrow.”

The words seemed to have no meaning. The two drew Kunicka out of the crowd; bending over her, they tried to understand, tried to comfort her. But there was no comfort for someone whose brother was going to be hanged to-morrow! Manya and Kazia knew the young, gay brother. He was their friend. He had done nothing wrong. How could he be going to die?

“Make haste, children! Enough talking!” It was the hated voice of the German superintendent, Miss Mayer, and the three were obliged to bury their grief and go into school.

It was no longer the private school to which Manya had gone as a little girl, but the government High School, run by the Russian government. In it, everything except the pupils were Russian. The Polish children were obliged to attend it, because only by so doing could they get a certificate of any sort which would enable them to get work. They attended, but they were rebels and freer to express their opinions than their elders. Manya and Kazia took delight in inventing witticisms against their Russian professors, their German master and especially against Miss Mayer who detested Manya only a little less than Manya detested her.

Little and dark Miss Mayer used to go about in soft slippers not to be heard and the better to spy on the girls.

“It's no more use speaking to that Sklodovska girl,” she said, “than throwing green peas at a wall!”

“Look at your ridiculous, frizzy, disorderly head, Marya Sklodovska! How often have you been told to confine your curls? Come here and let me brush them down and make you look like a decent school girl.” “Like a German Gretchen!” thought Manya, but she said nothing. So with the brush that brushed everybody's hair, she set on Manya's head with good hard blows. But however hard she brushed, the curls were rebels still—those light, capricious, exquisite curls that framed Manya's round, rebellious face.

“I won't have you look at me like that!” Miss Mayer would shout. “You have no right to look down on me!”

“I can't help it,” said Manya truthfully, for she was a head taller than Miss Mayer. No doubt she was glad that words sometimes have two meanings.

But the girls liked some of their teachers, for some were Polish. In some of the Russians also, to their dumb surprise, they found Polish sympathies. They began to understand that even in Russia there were rebels. One Russian master had gone so far as to give as a prize a book of revolutionary poems. That silent act became the talk of the school and the pupils watched him with wondering, admiring eyes. Poles could live with Russians. Oh, yes! Were not the pupils in that city school Russians, Poles, Germans, Jews? And were they not all happy together? In school they found no difference in the races. Outside school each nation kept apart, for all feared spies.

In spite of everything Manya loved her school; a little shamefacedly she confessed it. “Do you know, Kazia,” she wrote one holiday, “I like the school. Are you going to laugh at me? I like it. I even like it very much. I am not longing for it. No! But I am not sad at the thought of term and two years more of it is no horrible thought.”

But on that particular day, when Miss Mayer called the girls in from the courtyard, Manya had no thought for school. In the sunny morning, she had been dreaming of music and dance and jesting. Suddenly the world had changed. While the dim words of unheard lessons floated around her ears, she could see nothing but the young eager boy whom she knew… and a cold, pictured dawn with a gallows.

There was no thought of dancing at the Sklodovskis that night. Manya, Bronia and Hela, Kazia and Ula, her sister, all went to sit up the night through with Kunicka, keeping watch in the long night, thinking of the boy who had to die. That keeping watch is a Catholic custom, it is just staying awake to think. The six children sat with Kunicka. We who are happier cannot imagine what they thought or felt. It is so different when someone we love dies naturally, even children understand that; but this other—to sit and wait while the minutes pass and the hour of man's exceeding cruelty comes nearer to stain the dawn with wrong—that was horror indeed. They must have watched in silence, for there was nothing to say, nothing to do, only plenty to think, rebel thoughts for the hearts of six young rebels. From time to time, they did what they could for Kunicka, their own hearts breaking with sympathy. They tried to get her to drink something warm; gently they put their arms around her or tried to dry her tears. Then suddenly they realised that the new light was no longer candlelight. There was a red line in the sky. The red dawn had come. The six buried their terrified faces in their hands and threw themselves on their knees to pray for the young rebel who was dead.





Chapter IV　A Whole Year's Holiday


MANYA was sixteen. Gold medal day had come and Manya's gold medal was the third in the family. It was June and very hot. Manya, like all the prize winners, was dressed in black with a bunch of tea roses in her belt. The crowd pressed around her congratulating her and shaking hands. When it was all over, she left the High School for good, her fingers pressed tight on her proud father's arm.

He had promised her a whole year's holiday. That was a gift indeed, a year's holiday! Manya hadn't an idea why she should have it, but her father thought that as she had been working very hard and as she had done her work in less time than other girls, it was only fair that she should take that delightful way of waiting for her age-fellows to catch her up. So Manya the industrious became a lazybones and entered into the full fun of the thing.

“My dear little Devil,” she wrote to Kazia, “I don't believe algebra and geometry exist. Anyway I have completely forgotten them. I don't even do my embroidery. I don't do anything. I get up at ten, or sometimes at six—in the morning, be it spoken—I read nothing or only tales. I am the stupidest of the stupid and I laugh all alone at my complete inanity. A crowd of us wander through the woods or play battledore and shuttlecock, at which I am a booby, or puss-in-the-corner or follow-my-leader or any such intellectual game. Wild strawberries are everywhere and for a penny-farthing we can buy enough for a meal—that's a soup-plate full, piled high and overflowing. Alas! Alas! they are almost over and my appetite is limitless so that I am quite scared at my greed. We swing… we swing right up into the sky. We bathe, we catch shrimps by torchlight. By-the-bye, we have met an actor. He sang to us and recited to us and gathered us so many gooseberries that in return we plaited him a crown of wild poppies and white pinks and blue cornflowers and threw it at him as he left for Warsaw. They say he put it on and then, when the train came in, packed it in his suitcase and took it all the way to the city.”

Manya was to spend her year in the country, She loved every bit of it. She was to watch all the seasons go round and to discover at every turn fresh beauties in the land of Poland. Her uncle, Xavier, lived on the plains of Zwola. There she looked over level land to the furthest, furthest horizon of which one could dream, green land streaked with the brown colours of ploughed earth. Her uncle had many horses in stable and there she learned to ride. What she wore didn't matter to her. She borrowed trousers from her cousin which were too big for her, turned them up, belted them into gathers and was ready. Left hand on reins and holding the big horse's mane, left foot in the stirrup and right hand on the saddle, she stood for the first adventure as she had seen her uncle and cousins stand. But what a long way it was up! She would never get there however much she hopped or however still the good old horse stood.

“Good to try!” said her uncle, “scramble!” But her cousins did not leave her untaught. They showed her how to stand with her back to the horse's head before she sprang, how to help herself with a convenient mound and, finally, how to get just the right spring that could land her into the saddle of the tallest horse. It became her delight to go long expeditions on horseback over the spreading fields. Soon she could rise in the saddle at the trot or sit tight at the gallop. She explored new villages and met strange country folk and knew more and more of the Polish plain.

But an even greater pleasure was in store for her: she went to stay with another uncle, whose name is quite unpronounceable to English ears, Uncle Zdzislaw, who lived among the Carpathian Mountains. For the first time she saw snowy heights, dazzling in their whiteness and dark pine forests like rivers of ink making the snow more white… She longed to get closer up; to make her way through the trees, perhaps to the edge of the snow itself. She went for long walks up winding mountain paths which sometimes ended unexpectedly in a precipice, so that she had to retrace her steps. Sometimes the path ended at a hut and Manya and her cousins would go in and ask to see the owner's work; for all the mountaineers of that district were wood carvers and their simplest piece of furniture was a work of art. The peasants loved to show the things that they had made and when the children had admired the chairs and table and cuckoo clock and the coloured wooden bowls against the wall, they delved into cupboards and brought out little carved men or drinking cups or toys or even pictures carved in wood.

Once, in her wanderings, Manya came to a little mountain lake, a patch of water lying in the hills as blue as massed speedwell, and men called it “The sea's eye.” It was so lovely lying among the snow peaks that Manya thought it the gem of the whole country.

Within doors, life was quite riotously merry. Her uncle loved gaiety; so did his beautiful wife and as to his three daughters, they laughed all day and Manya with them. Guests arrived in plenty. Uncle and aunt would probably have been out shooting and have plenty of game to offer them. If they hadn't, there was nothing to do but slay a barn door chicken of which there were hundreds running about the yard. Then the girls flew to the kitchen and hastily baked the cakes. All was ready for the feast. For clothes, they hastily turned out cupboards and sewed together gay fancy dresses for charades, or if it was winter, for a “Kulig”—a winter fête.

Manya's first Kulig was a tremendous experience. The night was dark, but lit by the strange northern snow-light. Manya and her three cousins, wrapped in thick rugs, masked and dressed as Cracovian peasants, took their places in two sledges. Their outriders were boys in rustic costumes who lit the darkness with fantastic torches. Through the dark forest, they caught glimpses of other torches approaching. The cold night was suddenly filled with music, for the musicians were coming up, bringing four little Jews, who for two whole nights and two whole days Were to wring heart-stirring airs from their violins. They would play waltzes and mazurkas and all the world would catch up the refrains and sing them in chorus, making the night tuneful and noisy.

As the Jews played, other sledges joined them out of the darkness, three, five, ten sledges. In spite of hair-raising bends and glassy slopes those little musicians never missed a note as they led the fantastic troop under the frosty stats.

At the first lone farmhouse the sledges stopped with jingling bells and harness and all the company, laughing, shouting, and knocking loudly on the door, awakened the inmates, who were only pretending to be asleep. In a few moments the musicians were hoisted on to a table and the ball began in a room lit by torches.

Presently supper was brought and then, at a signal, suddenly the whole house was empty—empty of casks, of inhabitants, of horses, of sledges, of everything. A larger procession, with all the sledges of the new homestead, was wending its way through the forest to another farm.

A sledge with fresh horses, trying to pass another, went out of the beaten road, failed to get back and overturned in the snowdrift. The procession halted, torches waving in the wind, and gathered into a semicircle while willing hands brushed the snow from the occupants and righted their sledge. Again the bells rang out a wild peal of jingling speed in the night. But what had become of the musicians? Nobody knew. The leading sledge went faster and faster, hoping to catch them up; but it was soon apparent that they were not on that road; they had not gone on! A halt was called, a fork in the road was remembered. There was nothing for it but to go back and look for the little Jews along the other road. Everyone was worried. How would the dance go at the other farms if the musicians could not be found? But presently someone caught the joyful cry of violins above the sound of bells and the procession was complete again and growing in length as they stopped to dance at yet another farmhouse, and yet another and another.

The sun rose… the sun went down… the sun rose. The fiddlers had scarcely any time to eat or sleep. On the second night the vast train of sledges stopped with snorting horses and jingling bells before the biggest homestead for the real ball.

The little fiddlers played louder. The guests took their places for the famous figure dances. The chief boy, handsome and elegant, in his embroidered white costume advanced to lead out the best dancer of all the company. It was Manya Sklodovska, in the dress of a mountain maiden with a velvet jacket, puffed linen sleeves and a star-like crown decked with long, brightly coloured streamers.

They danced through the night. They danced a mazurka at eight in the morning. Manya said that never in her life had she enjoyed herself so much and her aunt said that if she enjoyed Kuligs so much, she should have one to celebrate her wedding.

But the joys of holidays were not over. An old pupil of Madame Sklodovska's, who had become Countess of Fleury, invited Hela and Manya to stay with her. The house stood on a tongue of land between two rivers. Manya had a lovely view from her room across the meeting waters and there she learned to row. “We do anything,” she wrote home, “that comes into our heads. We sleep all night and sometimes in the day. We dance. We are mad. In fact only a lunatic asylum would suit us!”

They varied their sleeping and dancing with riding and mushroom gathering and practical jokes. Once Manya asked the Countess's brother to go to town on a message. The unsuspecting young man went. The town was far. He came home in the dark and went to his room where all the young people of the house had slung his bed,his table, his chairs, his trunks, his clothes from the beams of the roof. His possessions had become entirely aerial and slapped him in the face as he moved among them.

On another day, lunch had been prepared for distinguished guests and the children were not invited. They ate the whole lunch before lunch and placed, by the empty table, a scarecrow representing a most satisfied and well-fed count! The culprits? Where were they? Vanished into thin air!

On the anniversary of the Count and Countess's wedding day, the gay company sent them, by two of their number, a huge crown made of vegetables. It weighed a hundred pounds and was presented to the happy couple as they sat on a decorated throne. Then the youngest member recited a poem which had been written by Manya for the occasion and ended thus:

For Louis' blessed day

A picnic be our pay!

For every girl invite a boy

In your example let us joy

And follow to the altar soon.

Grant us, grant us now this boon!

The Count and Countess did their best with a ball instead of a picnic. Manya and Hela wanted to be especially ravishing that night. They were poor and their ball dresses well worn. They counted their money. They turned the dresses over and over. They ripped off the faded tulle and found the linings quite good. A little blue tarlatan would do, they decided, instead of the tulle, and a ribbon here, a ribbon there would create new dresses. Thin purses and a skilful needle would do wonders. Flowers would do the rest and there would be money enough for two new pairs of shoes. When the shopping was done and the needlework was done and the garden had done its share, the mirror said: “You'll do.”

And Manya danced her new shoes through and fêted the morning by throwing them away.





Chapter V　People


MANYA was back in Warsaw. Her big grey eyes looked out with a laugh in them at a changed world. Her firm upper lip often twitched with a merry smile, but her face was often serious. Like the fathers of most of the world, Mr. Sklodovski let his children know that they had their living to earn. He had given up taking students and the family again lived in a little house of their own. It was hard enough, while their father was still earning, to pay the rent, the daily girl and the house-keeping and they had to look forward to the time when he would have nothing but a teacher's small pension to live on. That worried him. Like the fathers of most of the world, he had hoped to make enough money to provide for his family. Sitting by the lamp in the evening, he would sigh deeply. Four pair of happy eyes, between periwinkle-blue and grey, would look up at him and guess his thought; his four children would all protest together: “Don't worry, Father, aren't we all young and strong and able to earn for ourselves?” Mr. Sklodovski must have wondered, as he smiled at their eagerness, whether they would succeed in life as he had not done. He had worked hard and been very gifted and yet had won very little reward in money from life. Would his children be like him? The baldheaded, short, fat, little man sat under the lamp in his dark, meticulously brushed, shabby coat. Everything about him was precise and neat: his handwriting, his thoughts, his expressions, even his actions. He had brought up his children with the same exquisite, neat care. When he took them on excursions he made out the itinerary beforehand, pointed out the beauties of the landscape to them, realising, perhaps, what few people know, that most people miss seeing beauty because nobody mentions it. If they came to an old or famous building, he would tell them its history. Manya saw no faults in her father. It never occurred to her to mock his precise little ways. She thought of him as a fount of universal knowledge. And, indeed, he knew many things. He kept up with the new discoveries in physics and chemistry by buying learned pamphlets with his hard-earned savings. He knew, without a thought of his own cleverness, Greek and Latin and five modern languages. He wrote verse and read aloud beautifully to his children every Saturday evening so that they grew to know great literature. When he wanted to read to them some foreign book, David Copperfield, for example, he read it in Polish though the copy in his hand was English.

“There's nothing new at home,” wrote Manya to a friend. “The plants are quite well, thank you! The azaleas are in flower and Lancet is asleep on the rug! I have had my dress dyed and Gucia, the daily maid, is altering it. She's just done Bronia's, which is a success. I have little time and still less money. A lady who was recommended to us for lessons came; but when Bronia told her they would cost her a shilling an hour, she fled as if the house were on fire.”

Yet, paid badly or not, Manya had to teach. Nothing else was open to girls in those days. But she didn't think: “How many pupils can I get? What can I earn?” That wasn't Manya! She had her dreams—not the girl dream of getting married, nor the boy dream of engine driving. Her dream was Poland. She, Manya Sklodovska, must help Poland. How could she do that with her sixteen years and the stuff her father and her school and books had put into her head? There were others who dreamed for Poland, Manya knew, and plotted to throw bombs at the Czar. There were those who dreamed that God would answer their prayers for Poland. But, though Manya lent her passport to a revolutionary, she dreamed neither of those dreams. She believed that the most practical dream is the best: do the thing that is just in front of you; teach the Poles whom the Russian government was doing its best to keep ignorant; teach and teach and teach till Warsaw should become a great centre for the things of the mind, till Poland should lead Europe by being best.

New ideas were spreading in England and France. Manya had a friend ten years older than herself who had got wind of them and had started a secret society called the “Winged University” to study them. Manya, Bronia and Hela joined it. The little company met at one another's houses to be taught, not some weird or wild study, but just anatomy, biology and natural history. Yet at the sound of a knock at the door, a mouse in the wainscot, everyone started and trembled. If the police had caught them, it would have been prison for everybody. The members had to teach as well as learn. Manya collected a little library of books to lend to poor people but she had to teach them their letters and how to read before the books could be of any use to them.

Sometimes a Polish shop would be glad to let its work girls gather after work to meet Manya and sit thumbing books and racking brains in order to become more worthy citizens of Poland. No one was afraid that a single girl would give the secret away. Gay, reserved, little Manya, among the older, rougher girls refused to allow a single slang word or a single cigarette. Finding her curls too attractive, she cut them off, not noticing that by so doing she made herself look still more childish. She was full of work, trying her hand at everything: lectures, meetings, drawing, writing poetry, reading the literature of half a dozen countries—above all, following the far thoughts of great writers.

But what occupied her thoughts most was what was she going to do with Bronia. Bronia was getting old, or at least so thought Manya, and no one would see to Bronia's career if she didn't. Morning after morning, in fair weather or foul, she went to give her paid lessons. The rich kept her waiting, to them she was just a poor teacher, in a draughty corridor. “So sorry, Miss Sklodovska, my little girl is late this morning; you'll be able to give her her full lesson, of course?” At the end of the month her pay was forgotten. “So sorry, my husband will pay the two months together.” But Manya was needing the money then. She had been longing for it to buy a few necessary things.

Bronia was looking pale and discouraged. Manya would have to set aside her own ambitions, her desire to go to a university to satisfy her great need of knowledge. She must get Bronia off her hands first.

“Bronia, I have been thinking it all out,” she said one day; “and I have spoken to father. I think I have found a way.”

“A way to what?”

Manya had to be very careful and tactful. “Bronia, how long, could you live in Paris on what you've saved?”

“I could pay the journey and one year's living, but Medicine needs five years,” answered Bronia quickly.

“Yes, and lessons at a shilling an hour won't take us far.”

“Well?”

“Well, if each of us is working for herself, neither of us will succeed. Whilst with my plan you can take your train this autumn.”

“Manya! You're mad!”

“No. At first you can spend your own money and afterwards I will send you some. So will father. I can save for myself at the same time. And when you are a doctor, it will be my turn to go and you can help me.”

There were tears in Bronia's eyes for she understood what the offer meant to Manya but she thought the arithmetic a little odd. “How are you going to keep yourself, to help me and to save all at the same time?” she asked.

“Ah! That's the way I am finding. I am going to get a resident post where I shall be kept by someone else and have no chance to spend anything! Isn't that perfect?”

“No,” said Bronia, “I don't see why I should go first. You are cleverer. If you go first, you will succeed quickly and afterwards I can go.”

“Why? Oh foolish Bronia, dear! Aren't you twenty and I only seventeen? You have been waiting centuries. I have time. The eldest must go first. When you have a practice, you can shower gold on me! Besides I have set my heart on it, so there!”

So in September, just a month before her eighteenth birthday, Manya found herself in the waiting room of the Governesses' agency, dressed as she was sure a governess should be dressed. Her hair which had grown again was neatly done under her faded hat; her dress was plain and severe; everything about her was ordinary and quiet.

Nervously she approached the lady at the desk, holding her certificate and testimonials very tight. The lady read the testimonials very attentively and then suddenly looked at Manya; she even stared at her. “You really mean that you know German, Russian, French, Polish and English perfectly?” she questioned.

“Yes” said Manya, “though my English is not so good as the others. Still, I can teach it up to examination standard. I won the High School gold medal.”

“Ah! And what salary do you want?”

“Forty pounds a year resident.”

“I will let you know if a post offers.” With that not-tooencouraging promise, Manya left the agency.

It was not long before Manya found herself a private governess. The family's name is secret, because they would not like to remember the trick fate played them. They opened a little door for Manya Slodovska, aged eighteen, and through it, as she tells us, she caught a little glimpse of hell and she wouldn't go through. Life meant Manya to be a great giver of gifts, not an unhappy, little despised slave. They were rich, the B—s; they kept the governess in her place, speaking to her as an iceberg might speak, could it creak out its thoughts. They threw their great wealth about in public, but they kept her six months without her salary and expected her not to read in the evenings in order to save lamp oil. Their speech to people's faces was honeysweet, but behind their backs so backbiting that Manya says they didn't leave their friends a dry thread to cover them.

“I have learnt from them,” she wrote, “that people in books are true and that one is wise not to mix with those whom wealth has spoilt.” Perhaps it was such knowledge, won when she was eighteen, that made Manya Sklodovska in the far future unspoilable by any offer of great wealth!

But Manya's plan was not working. Living at the B—s in town, she found that she spent a little money every day. It was very pleasant to be able to see her father sometimes and to be able to keep up with her friends of the winged university, but when you have made up your mind to a plan, you must carry it out whatever the cost. Manya found that she must leave home entirely, must get a post in the depth of the country, where she would be able to spend nothing. In that way, Bronia, who was already in Paris, would be able to have what she had planned for her.

The very post she was seeking turned up. It was far away in the country and it was a little better paid—fifty pounds a year this time. And, of course, fifty pounds went farther in those days than now. But it was with rather a sinking heart that Manya showed her new address to her father, though probably it did not look as outlandish and far away to him as it does to us.

Melle Marya Sklodovska

c/o Monsieur Z—

SZCZUKI,

near PRZASNYSZ

It was January when Manya set out for the country, a January in Poland where the snow lay thick for months together. As the train drew slowly out of the station, she realised that she could no longer see her father waving to her. For the first time in her life she was wholly alone and frightened. Those new people in a far away village, from which there was no escape might prove to be as unkind as her last employers. Or her father, who was getting old, might be taken ill. Ought she to have left him? The long fields of snow crept by in the gathering darkness, but they had long been blotted out by Manya's tears.

Three hours in the train and then a sledge to meet her. Warm fur rugs were tucked around her and out into the snowy majesty of the winter night she speeded through a silence broken only by the noise of sleigh bells.

Four hours in the sleigh. Iced and hungry, Manya wondered if the horses would ever stop. Then a yawning space of light, an open door and a whole family to meet her—the tall master of the house, the mistress, the shy children clinging to their mother's skirt, their eyes alive with curiosity. Madame welcomed her with warm, friendly words, gave her boiling tea, took her herself to her room, and left her alone to recover some warmth and to unpack her few shabby cases.

Manya was in the depth of the country. She looked round with satisfaction at her whitewashed, simply furnished room, with its warm stove in an alcove.

The next morning she drew her curtains, expecting to see snowy fields and forests bending under snow. Instead she was greeted with factory chimneys belching black smoke. She drew back and looked again—not one chimney but many, and not a tree to be seen, not a bush, not a hedge. She was in the sugar beet district. As far as the eye could see there was nothing but ploughed land waiting for beetroot. The whole country was devoted to beetroot. For beetroot the peasants ploughed and sowed and harvested. The factories were beetroot refineries. The village consisted of the cottages of the beetroot workers sheltering under factory walls. The house where she lived belonged to the director of beetroot. The river flowed coloured with beetroot.

The factories were a disappointment to Manya. So were the young men and maidens of the big houses round. They talked of nothing but what he said and she said, of the clothes they would wear, of who was giving the next ball and of how long the last had gone on. Manya was so horrified when Mr. and Mrs. Z— came home from a dance at one o'clock in the afternoon that she seemed to have forgotten how much she had once rejoiced at dancing till eight in the morning.”Give me the pen of a caricaturist,” she exclaimed, “for some of these people are really worthy of it. The girls are geese, who don't know how to open their mouths and so far my Bronka, the eldest daughter of the house, is a rare pearl for sense and interest in life.” Besides Bronka, there was another interesting person at Szczuki, her little brother Stas, aged three. He was the life of the long, one-storied house. His pattering feet went everywhere, down the long corridors, out into the glass verandahs that looked shabby under the leafless virginia creeper. His prattle amused Manya. Once his Nanny told him that God was everywhere. “Stas doesn't like that,” he replied; “I'm afraid he'll catch me! Will he bite me?”

Andzia, Manya's special pupil, was ten and a Fidgetty Phyllis, who ran away from her lessons whenever a visitor called. Manya was supposed to teach her for four hours a day, but what with her perpetual running away and being caught and brought back and having to go back to the beginning again, work did not get on, as one might say, fast. Andzia, too, was apt to lie in bed till Manya pulled her out by the arm, a proceeding that aggravated Manya particularly. On one of those mornings, it took her two hours to re-cover her temper. The best part of her day were the three hours in which she read with Bronka and those other hours of leisure when she wrote long letters home: “I am coming to Warsaw at Easter,” she said; “and at that thought everything in me rejoices so much that it is all I can do not to shout like a savage.”

Along the muddy village lanes, she met the village children, dirty little boys and girls, their bright eyes looking out at her from under their matted tow-like hair. “Aren't these Poles?” she said to herself. “I, who have vowed to enlighten the people, can I not do something for them?” Those ragamuffins either had never learnt anything or only knew the Russian alphabet. Manya thought that it would be fun to start a secret Polish school for them.

Bronka was delighted when she heard of the idea. “Not so fast,” said Manya. “If we are caught, it will be Siberia for us, you know.” They both knew what Siberia meant—exile in a terrible land of frozen plains. But Bronka was ready to take the risk. The two girls obtained the permission of Mr. Z— and the class began.

Fortunately, there was an outside staircase to Manya's room. Ten or eighteen small, grubby boys and girls began to tramp up it. Manya borrowed a deal table and some benches and spent some of her valuable savings on buying exercise books and pens for her pupils. Then the fun began. Clumsy fingers grasped the unaccustomed instruments and letters were scrawled on white paper. Slowly the mysterious fact that you can write the sounds you hear in black on white began to dawn on the urchins. The proud parents, who could not themselves read, came up the wooden stairs and stood overwhelmed and delighted at the back of the room watching the marvellous thing a son or a daughter was doing. The sons and daughters were not doing it easily. They twisted, they sniffed, they groaned as if making a letter was as hard as carrying beetroots up a mountain. Manya and Bronka moved among them, helping them in their painful trying. They were smelly, they were often inattentive, they weren't very clever, but for the most part, their bright eyes showed that they were excited about their lessons and longing to learn.





Chapter VI　Fortunate Misfortune


OTHER people's holidays come when the summer comes; but a governess stays at her post most of the year. She is even more useful when the boys come home, and little girls need getting out of bed winter and summer. Manya was bored. Nothing ever happened. Tomorrow was always twin sister to yesterday—work from eight to half-past eleven, work from two to half-past seven, walk and lunch from half-past eleven to two. In the evening, it was reading aloud to Andzia if she had been good; sewing and talking if she had not. At nine o'clock at last came freedom to read her own books and to study. But even then she was liable to be interrupted to do one of the hundred and one things required of a governess. For instance, Andzia's godfather needed someone to play chess with him and the governess would do quite well; or a fourth was wanted at whist and it did not matter if the governess liked whist or not. Manya grew hungrier for knowledge as the chance of it slipped farther and farther away. Her books were old fashioned and there was no one with whom she could discuss her difficulties. She hadn't an idea what she was going to do. She thought with envy of the thousands of girls flocking to colleges the world over, meeting the choice and master spirits of their age, being taught and working in laboratories. Vienna, Berlin, London, St. Petersburg, especially Paris, seemed so many Meccas to her! No, not Vienna, Berlin or St. Petersburg for they were the capitals of Poland's oppressors. But London and Paris! She was wild with longing to go to Paris, free generous Paris that oppressed no one, but welcomed exiles and invited everyone to come to her who wanted to think, who wanted to know. Despair was getting hold of Manya. It was so hard to work alone. Her money accumulated so intolerably slowly and Bronia would need help for so many years. Her father also would be wanting her to take care of him when he was really old. Would Manya ever get to the university?

She had grown deliciously pretty. Her broad, lofty brow had all the sternness taken from it by her ravishing, burnished hair; her grey eyes deepset under well-marked eyebrows seemed very large and gazed at one with gay and penetrating understanding; her wilful mouth with a suggestion of a smile forced one to look and think twice. Her skin was like a very peach. She was graceful, with exquisite wrists and ankles; and best of all her thoughtfulness gave her just that touch of mystery which makes people always want to know a girl.

Casimir, the eldest son of the house, was glad to find Manya there when he came home for the holidays. He came across her snipping off dead roses in the lovely garden. He had heard about her from his sister's letters, but he hadn't believed in her, and didn't he know all about the whole dull race of governesses?

“But… By the sword of Poland!” he exclaimed to himself, “This one is different!”

“You have given your ragged school a holiday this morning, Mademoiselle?”

“Oh, no!” said Manya, her face alive with interest as usual. “They don't come till five, when their other work, whatever it may be, is done.”

So, thought Manya, this was Bronka's adored brother, this tall, handsome, charming-mannered student, who spoke to her so friendlily and went on to take so lively an interest in her pupils whom he would insist on calling her “ragged school.”

That evening she did not go at nine to her heavy books. There was far more to be learnt by real talk with a university student about the subjects he was studying. To-morrow lost its resemblance to yesterday. Summer broke the order of work. Casimir insisted on boating picnics and Manya was especially good at the oar. She rode so that it was a delight to watch her and there was no lack of horses in the stable. There were some forty to choose from and the three chose well and rode whole days across the endless plain. There were driving picnics also and Casimir noticed that Manya's delicate wrists handled the reins of the second wagonette with skill. Casimir had sprained his left thumb so that the coachman had to drive his mother and the babies in the first wagonette.

Among the endless “geese” whom Casimir had hitherto met, none had the talk and mystery of this strange girl. When he returned to Warsaw for the autumn, he longed for Christmas.

“It ought always to be winter, Mademoiselle,” he said. And to Manya's unsuspecting “No! Why?” he laughed. “Aren't we told to worship beauty and is there anything lovelier than a girl with perfect ankles skating gracefully? And then there are the dances! You who dance so well, don't you love them and the long sledge drives under winter stars?”

Yes, Manya had returned to loving dancing, but still she preferred the summer—the summer holidays.

“The holidays? When I am here?”

Casimir had long guessed her answer. He said that he would go to his father at once. People did not generally marry governesses, but Manya was different, so entirely different. Everyone in his home loved her; his father chose her for his walking companion; his mother introduced her to all her friends; his sister adored her. They had often invited her father, her brother and her sister to stay in the home; they showered presents and flowers on her on her birthday; they were surely just waiting to welcome her with delight as a new daughter.

But about that, Casimir was mistaken. When he told his parents that he wanted to marry Manya, his father was furious and his mother nearly fainted. Should their eldest son, he on whom all their hopes were fixed, who could bring home as bride the richest, noblest girl of all the country, should he marry a penniless governess? Marry a woman who earned her living by selling her work in other people's houses!

“Casimir, you're mad! People don't marry governesses !”

“People don't marry governesses! What a good thing!” hummed the old Earth as it whizzed round the Sun bringing Summer after Winter and Marie Curie for all of us instead of Madame Manya Casimir Z—.

But Manya who could not foresee the future, was very unhappy. Everyone in the house grew cold to her; yet she could not throw up her post and go away, because she had to send Bronia twenty pounds a year. All she could do was to make up her mind that never, never again would she ever love any man. All the tomorrows took on again their resemblance to all the yesterdays. She gave her lessons, scolded Andzia, shook Julek awake, because every book sent him to sleep, taught her ragged school, read chemistry, played chess, danced, walked. Only one thing sometimes introduced a little excitement: the roads were so badly marked that they would disappear entirely under the snow and the sleigh and its occupants would find themselves buried in a snow-filled ditch. On such occasions, laughter would bring back some of the old gay friendliness.

At that time, her letters home grew longer, but she often hadn't a stamp to send them with or the money to buy one. “I haven't heard from Bronia,” she complained, “but perhaps she hasn't a stamp either.” Because of her own sadness she was more able to enter into the troubles of her father, her brother and Hela. To her father she wrote: “Don't worry about us; you have done everything a father could do for us; after all, haven't you given us quite nice characters? We'll be able to earn a living all right, you'll see.” And to her brother: “Joseph, borrow a hundred roubles and stay in Warsaw. Don't bury yourself in the country and don't be angry if I do give you advice. Remember our agreement to say anything that comes into our heads. Everybody thinks that to practise in the country would be to bury yourself in a hole and have no career. A doctor without a chemist's shop, a hospital or books will just become a dud, however good his resolutions maybe. If that happened to you, darling, I should be desperately unhappy, because now that I have lost all hope of ever being anything myself, all my ambition is fixed on you and Bronia. You mustn't bury the gifts that our family undoubtedly possess. They must come out in one of us. The more I despair about myself, the more I hope for you.” Manya was also feeling great sympathy for Hela, who had been given up by her lover, and great indignation against young men in general: “Truly,” she wrote, “one is learning to have a good opinion of people! If they don't want to marry poor girls, they can go to the devil. No one asks them to do it, but why fall in love with them and then upset them?”

It was a bad moment in Manya's life. She said she was afraid she was catching stupidity from her pupils, which is a fear that comes to many teachers. Her great dreams seemed foolish. “The only dream I have now,” she wrote, “is to have a corner of my own where I can live with my father. to get a little independence and a home, I would give half my life. If by any possibility I can leave Z—s, which does not seem very likely, I will get a post in a boarding school in Warsaw and earn a little extra by private lessons. That's all I hope for. Life isn't worth bothering so much about.” It was, indeed, a bad moment. But a novel called On the Banks of the Niemen fortunately reminded her that ideas like that were not the real Manya. “Where have my dreams gone?”she wrote to Bronia. “I wanted to work for the people, and I have scarcely been able to teach a dzen village boys and girls to read. As to awakening in them a thought of what they are and of what they might do in the world! You couldn't dream of such a thing. Life is hard. I am becoming so mean, so common. Then suddenly a book like this novel gives me a shock and I am miserable about it all.” At the same time she wrote to her cousin: “I am in a black humour, for our daily company are frightful west winds, seasoned with rain, floods and mud. There's not a thought of frost and my skates hang sadly in the wardrobe. Perhaps you don't know that in our small hole frost and its advantages are as important as a debate between Conservatives and Liberals in Galicia! Don't think that your tales bore me. On the contrary it is a true delight to hear that there are places on the earth's surface where people move and even think! I feel things violently with a physical violence! Then I shake myself and get back to myself out of a nightmare and tell myself ‘Don't be crushed either by people or by events.’ But the need of new impressions, of change, of movement seizes me at moments with such force that I want to do something utterly, utterly foolish to put an end to this eternal sameness. Happily I have so much work that this folly doesn't get hold of me often.”





Chapter VII　Change


MANYA had desired change and she was to get change. She was to travel. She heard of another pupil who lived in Warsaw, but who was on holiday in far away Belgium and Manya was to join her there. Manya became suddenly doubtful whether she liked so much change as that. She would have to travel alone and have five changes of train. She would surely get lost; or thieves might come into her compartment at night while she slept. But none of these things happened. She found herself safely met by her new employers and introduced to an entirely new world—a world of great wealth which she was expected to share and to enjoy. Her pupil's mother was beautiful and charming. For the first time in her life Manya was close to lovely dresses made by Worth's; she was expected to finger and admire soft furs and brilliant jewels; she saw people who were becoming her friends looking at her from the walls where their portraits hung painted by the greatest painters. She moved among all the loveliest things that wealth can give and looked on at all the charm of parties and balls, gaiety and music. Moreover these rich people were human and kind. Mrs. F— liked her, took her everywhere, called her to her friends “The exquisite Miss Sklodovska.”

We have not heard what Manya thought of it all, because something far more exciting was about to happen to her. On the hall table lay a letter with the Paris post mark addressed to Miss Sklodovska in Bronia's handwriting—a letter written on squared exercise book paper, written hurriedly between two lectures. What news! Bronia was going to be married! Bronia was inviting Manya to share her home in Paris as soon as she had it! Paris! ... A

University… All her hopes fulfilled?

It was not as simple as that. Manya had known for some time that Bronia was engaged to the cleverest, handsomest, most delightful Polish student in Paris. His name, like that of Manya'sown lover, was Casimir, Casimir Dluski. He had been obliged to flee from Poland because he was suspected of having been connected with a plot. In Paris he was watched by request of the Czar's police and had all kinds of odd information entered against him in the books of the Paris Gendarmerie. But, in spite of that, he was a gay young doctor and he was going to marry Bronia. So Bronia would never be able to return to Warsaw to take care of her father. That would be Manya's part, for Hela was not muda use for taking care of anybody.

How lovely, how wonderful, how ideal shone the future according to Bronia! But Manya wrote back: “I have been a fool, I am a fool, I shall always be a fool my whole life through, or rather to translate into more fashionable language: I never had any luck! I haven't any luck! I never shall have any luck!” Thereupon the unlucky may take heart as they consider what was to happen to Manya. She went on: “I have dreamed of Paris as one dreams of salvation, but hope of getting there fled a long time ago and now that the possibility of getting there has come to me, I don't know what to do. I can't talk to father about it, because I think his heart is set on our plan of living together next year and I would like to give him a little happiness in his old age. On the other hand, my heart breaks when I think of how my gifts are being wasted and yet gifts ought to be used.” It was that feeling that gifts ought to be used that made her urge Bronia in the same letter to put pride in her pocket and beg, with all her most ingratiating skill, a rich friend to help Joseph to use his gifts. Manya argued that it would not be only Joseph who would be helped, but the world which would profit by his skill. All through her life Manya was to keep the opinion that one of the noblest works is to help the greatly gifted to use their gifts for the world. She ended her letter: “My heart is so black, so sad that I feel how wrong I am to talk to you of all this and poison your happiness.”

So Manya went home to live for at least a year with her father in a little home of their own. To some people it would have seemed dull, but Manya had a brain and found more sensible talk in her father's house than in any other. She also returned to the strange “winged” secret society and talked and studied.

But Chance had a trick up her sleeve. No one would have suspected, if he walked in May down the quiet tree-planted avenue of Cracow and smelt the purple lilacs in the grass-grown court of No. 66, that there was anything surprising or world-shaking there. In the court, beside the lilacs, there was a little one-storied building with tiny windows. Museum of Industry and Agricul-ture was written in large letters over its doors. Were old ploughshares or prehistoric spades kept there? Not a bit of it! Russia allowed museums to exist. They are always such properly dead places. But any intelligent person can teach in a museum. Manya's cousin was the Director of this one and, secretly, he taught science in it. He had a laboratory where the students could actually touch apparatus.

For the first time in her life Manya Sklodovska entered a laboratory! And that was to make a remarkable difference to the great world. She couldn't go there much, only in the evenings and on Sunday. There was no one to teach her when she got there. She worked all alone trying to reproduce experiments described in text books. Her results were sometimes unexpected, but sometimes a tiny success filled her with hope and sometimes a striking failure filled her with despair. But always, she found discovery, or even trying to discover, a wild delight.

When late at night she got home and rolled into bed, something seized her, something grabbed her mind, something spoke to her in the dark. She couldn't sleep. It was as if another someone in herself was talking to her, hammering at her thoughts, telling her what she must get up and do. Her work had found her and was insisting that she must do it. Those test tubes and retorts of the museum were friends and allies of her father's old physical apparatus which she had once loved. Manya Sklodovska had found herself—that self whose clever hands must for ever handle tubes and flames, elements and metals, while her clever brain drew conclusions from what her hands did and looked into the future.

But what should she do? Hands and brain said go! Love said stay with her father and brother and sister, with her lover Casimir Z—, who was still trying to win his parents' consent to his marriage. Manya met him in the holidays. They walked the mountains together, he told her in long talks of his difficulties and asked her advice.

“If you can't find a way out yourself,” exclaimed Manya, at the end of her patience, “don't ask me.” She at least knew her own mind at last. She wrote hurriedly to Bronia: “Give me a definite answer. I won't be any trouble to you. You can put me to sleep anywhere. But, I implore you, answer frankly.

Bronia answered frankly; she would have telegraphed if telegrams had not been too dear. Manya would have caught the next train if she had not had so many arrangements to make. She put all her savings on the table and counted them with her father. He added what he could to them. There, before their eyes, lay the round roubles that made Paris possible, only just possible.

Manya could not afford to travel third all the way. In Poland and France third was the cheapest, but Germany had a fourth. It did not matter that the fourth was like a succession of luggage vans. They had no separate compartments and they were bare, except for a bench round the four sides, and thoughtful people took their own stools and sat in the middle. Manya would do that. She would have to take a lot of luggage to save buying in France, but the bulkiest she could send in advance by luggage train—her own mattress, her blankets, her sheets, her table napkins. The only thing she had to buy was a cheap, strong, wooden trunk which she marked proudly M.S. Into it she put her strong, durable clothes, her shoes, her two hats. Then she did up the packages she would take with her in the truck for the journey: food and drink for three days in the train, the stool, her books, a bag of caramels and a rug.

Manya was off to Paris. She was twenty-four and her eyes literally shone with eagerness and joy. The long-hoped-for adventure had begun.





Chapter VIII　“I Take the Sun and Throw It...”


“I TAKE the Sun and throw it…” Manya laughed with joy at the words. Where was she? In the heart of Paris where joyous, free things happened, where in lightness of heart her great teacher, Paul Appell, could teach what he pleased, how he pleased; and, if he taught truth, crowds would flock to his teaching.

Manya had arrived early for the lecture and chosen a front seat in the great amphitheatre of the Sorbonne. She put her notebooks and her penholder neatly on the desk in front of her. All around her was the noise of the crowd getting into their places, but Manya did not hear them; she was absorbed in thought. Suddenly there was silence, for the master had come in and, as all his students were ardent mathematicians, they expected a treat.

Appell, with his square head, in his dark severe gown, explained so clearly that the very stars seemed to move obediently into their places as he spoke and the earth seemed at his mercy. He adventured boldly into the furthest regions of space, he juggled with figures and with stars. He said perfectly naturally and fitting the action to the word: “I take the Sun and throw it…”

Manya was happy. How could anyone find science dull? She thought how exquisite were the unchanging laws of the universe and how still more wonderful it was that the human mind could understand them. Was not Science stranger than a fairy tale, more delicious that a book of adventure? It was worth years of suffering she felt just to hear that phrase uttered by a savant: “I take the Sun and throw it…”

But how much else Manya had found in Paris! When she had first jumped from the train in the smoky, noisy North Station, she had thrown back her shoulders and breathed deep, not noticing the smoke. For the first time she was breathing the air of a free land. Outside the station everything seemed to her a miracle. The children in the gutter teased one another in the tongue they wanted to speak; what a miracle for the Polish girl who had had to speak Russian! The book shops sold the books they wanted to sell, the books of all the world; what a miracle!

But most miraculous of all, that road where she jumped on her first omnibus and scrambled to the cheap seats on top, was taking her, Manya Sklodovska, to a university that opened its doors to women! And what a university! The Sorbonne was the most famous university in the world. Even Luther, the German, had confessed that Paris had the most famous school in the whole world. The university was being rebuilt; workmen were everywhere; dust and noise were everywhere; classes moved from room to room as the workmen took possession. But that mattered nothing to Manya. At last she could learn what she wanted.

From that time on, she began to write her Christian name in French—Marie. With her surname she could do nothing. Her young associates found it too difficult to pronounce and a little on account of it left her alone. In the long corridors they turned to glance back at the simply, poorly-dressed stranger with the airy, fairy hair and intense eyes. “Who is she?” asked one. “A foreigner with an impossible name,” answered another. “They say she is always among the first in Physics, but she doesn't talk.”

Marie had to work very hard. She had had no idea how ignorant she would find herself in comparison with her companions. Her French turned out not to be as useful as she had expected. She missed whole phrases in a lecture. She found great chasms in her mathematics and physics. She set to work to correct all her defects.

It was well for her that in those first days she lived with Bronia and Casimir. Bronia was a genius for making things comfortable. She had taken a flat outside Paris where flats were cheaper and had furnished it with borrowed money. She was not the sort of person who lived just anyhow for fear of the risk of not being able to pay back. She had to have pretty things in her home, nicely draped curtains, graceful furniture, a piano and a few bright flowers in a vase. In her little kitchen she cooked exquisitely well-flavoured dishes and cakes, or made tea with tea sent especially from Poland, because she felt that there were some things Paris could not produce.

The quarter where she lived was, as in medieval times, almost reserved for butchers, and Doctor Dluski's patients were mostly sick butchers. They interviewed him in the little study which was set apart for his use during certain hours of the day. At other times it was Bronia's consulting room where she saw the butcher's wives about their babies. In the evenings work was strictly set aside and the two doctors tried to entice their newly arrived sister to all the fun of the fair. If there was a little money to spend they took her to a cheap seat at the theatre; if there wasn't, they gathered round their own piano or gave a tea party to their exiled Polish friends, when talk and laughter and teasing went on around the oil lamp and the tea-table set with Bronia's homemade cakes. Manya often withdrew early from those parties to work alone in her room, because she felt she had no time to play.

“Come out, Miss Bookworm!” called Casimir one evening; “it is Poland that calls; you have got to come this time. Hat and coat, quick! I've got complimentary tickets for a concert.”

“But . . .”

“But me no buts! It's that young Pole we were talking of and very few people have taken seats. We must go to fill the hall. I've got some volunteers and we are going to clap our hands off to give him the feeling of success. If you only knew how beautifully he plays!”

Marie could not resist her gay brother-in-law with his dark, sparkling eyes. Downstairs she hastened, dressing as she went, and ran to catch the old horse bus. She sat in the half-empty hall and watched the tall, thin man with the wonderful face and shock of copper-red hair walk up the platform and open the piano. She listened… Liszt, Schumann, Chopin lived again under his marvellous fingers. Marie was passionately moved. The pianist in his threadbare coat, playing to empty benches, did not seem to her an obscure beginner, but a king, almost a god.

The Dluskis asked him to their home. He went, taking with him his beautiful future wife whom Manya's mother had known. Mrs. Sklodovska used to say of the girl that she could never take her out because she was too beautiful. Sometimes the fiery-haired young man would go to the Dluski's piano, and at his touch, the common thing became sublime with heavenly music; for he who played was Paderewski, someday to be world famous, first as a pianist and then as President of a free Poland.

But those days were still far away. In 1891 Marie lived in Paris among a group of Polish exiles who seemed to make a little Polish island in the French city. They were young; they were gay; they were poor. On the fête days of the year, they met for parties in which everything was as Polish as they could make it. They ate Polish cakes, they acted Polish plays, they printed their programmes in Polish and decorated them with Polish scenes: a cottage in an expanse of snow, a dreamy boy bending over books, a Father Christmas throwing scientific textbooks down a chimney, an empty purse that rats had gnawed. When they acted plays, Marie was too busy to learn a part; but in a tableau, she once represented “Poland breatking her chains” Dressed in a long tunic such as the ancients wore, the colours of the Polish flag draped round her and her fair hair framing her Slav face, she was greeted by all the young people as a very vision of Poland.

Yet to show love for Poland, even in free Paris, was a dangerous thing. Mr. Sklodovski begged Manya not to be seen again in a Polish festivity which could get into the newspapers. “You know,” he wrote, “that there are people in Paris noting the names of those who take any part in Polish affairs and this might be a trouble to you and prevent you getting a post later on in Poland. It is wiser to keep out of the limelight.”

Marie scarcely needed that hint from her father. She wanted to give all her time to work, to live alone, free from the interruption of the piano, of her brother-in-law's evening chatter, of fiends dropping in. And she wanted to live nearer to the university to save her bus fares and the time the bus took.

Sadly, accompanied by both the Dluskis, she left the comfort and friendliness of her sister's home and set out to find her own work place, her own utter solitude.

She was going to live the life of her dreams, a life entirely given up to study. She would have to do it on one pound a week or rather less. Out of that she would have to pay for her room, her food, her clothes, her paper, her books and her university fees. Could it be done? That was her mathematical problem and, fortunately, she was good at mathematics, but that particular problem would take some doing. “Ah!” she thought, “I needn't eat much!” She had never had time to learn to cook. Her friends said that she didn't even know what went into soup. She didn't know and she hadn't time. She would never dream of taking time from physics to prepare a dinner. So she lived on bread and butter, cherries and tea, with an occasional egg or a piece of chocolate.

Her room was cheap—4s. 6d. a week. It was just an attic under the roof, lit by a sloping window, unheated, with no gas and no water. Her only furniture was a folding iron bedstead with her Polish mattress, a stove, a deal table, a kitchen chair, a washing basin, an oil lamp with a penny shade, a water bucket which she had to fill at the common tap on the landing, a spirit lamp to cook her food, two plates, one knife, a fork, a spoon, a cup, a saucepan, a kettle and three glasses for tea. When visitors came, her trunk was seat enough for two.

Two sacks a year of charcoal, which she bought on the street and carried up, bucket by bucket, all the six storey's, gave her all the warmth she allowed herself. Light she could almost do without. As soon as it began to get dark, she went to the St. Geneviève library and read there, her head in her hands, her elbows on the long table, till closing time at ten at night. After that she only needed oil in her lamp to last her till two in the morning, when she went to bed.

That was food, house, warmth and light settled. As to clothes, Marie could sew and brush and she meant to keep herself neat by brushing and mending, not by buying. She could do her own washing in her basin at the cost of a little soap.

That was a deliciously cheap life she planned in which nothing should interrupt her learning. But girls' bodies have a way of having something to say on their own account. Marie was surprised that often, when she left her books, she turned giddy. She even fainted sometimes on her way to bed before she had time to lie down. When she returned to consciousness, she told herself that she must be ill; but even of that she took no notice, merely thinking she would soon be better.

When her doctor brother-in-law told her she looked ill, she replied that she had been working and turned the conversation with a request for the baby. She had begun to make a great pet of Bronia's new baby and liked to turn attention from herself.

But luckily, one day, Marie fainted in public and the girl who saw it fetched Casimir. By the time he arrived, Marie was well again, but Casimir insisted on examining her. Then without a word he examined the room. Where, he asked, was the food cupboard? Manya hadn't got such a thing. Nowhere was there anything that showed any sign of eating and only a packet of tea to suggest that Marie drank anything.

“What have you eaten to-day?” asked the doctor.

“To-day?... I don't know... I lunched...”

“What did you eat?”

“'Cherries…Oh, all sorts of things…”

In the end Marie had to confess that since yesterday she had eaten a bunch of radishes and half a pound of cherries. She had worked till three in the morning and she had slept only four hours.

The doctor was furious, furious with the little fool, looking at him with innocent, cheerful grey eyes and more furious with himself for not having seen that his clever sister-in-law was a great silly in some things.

Sternly he ordered her to collect what she would want for a week and to come with him. He was so angry he wouldn't talk. At home, Bronia was sent out to buy beefsteak and Marie was ordered to eat it properly underdone in its red gravy and with its crisp potatoes. In less than a week she was again the healthy girl who had so lately come from Warsaw.

Because she was worried about her examination, she was allowed to go back to her attic on condition that she would feed herself sensibly. But alas, the very next day she was living on the air that blows.

Work!…Work! ... Marie was feeling her own brain growing. Her hands were getting cleverer. Soon Professor Lippman trusted her with a piece of original research and she had won her opportunity to show her skill and the originality of her mind. Any day of six she could be seen, in her coarse science overall, standing before an oak table in the lofty physical laboratory of the Sorbonne watching some delicate piece of apparatus or gazing at the steady boiling of some fascinating substance. Other similar workers were round her, men for the most part, utterly silent, doing a thing that was more absorbing than talk.

But when the experiments had come out, the boys looked at the girl, said a word at the door, pressed round her to make friends. She was growing a little less standoffish. Once the boys' eagerness to walk with her became so eager that her friend Mademoiselle Dydyuska had to shoo them away with her parasol. Marie had no time for friendship. With an iron will, a mad love for perfection and an incredible stubbornness she stuck to her work.

She won her licence in Physics in 1893 and in Mathematics in 1894, being top of the list in Physics and second in Mathematics. She was also working for perfection in French, refusing to allow any Polish accent to remain on her tongue; she intended to speak French like the French with only a little rolling of the “r,” which, though she did not intend it, only added to her charm.

She was not too busy to take note of flowers and springtime in Paris. She never forgot that she was a Polish peasant belonging to the fields. She spent Sunday in the country and talked of the lilacs and fruit trees in bloom and the air which was scented with flowers.

When the scorching days of July came, there was another examination. Marie was nervous. With thirty others shut into an airless room she gazed at the paper whose words danced and glimmered before her eyes. She pulled herself together and wrote. She waited, as so many others have done, with a sinking heart for the day of the result. When it came, she crept to listen to the announcement into a corner of the great amphi-theatre where she felt very insignificant in the crowd of students and their parents, for she was sure she had done badly.

The noise of talk and of a moving crowd suddenly became silence. The examiner had entered with his list. Marie had no time to listen. The examiner had already spoken the first name:

Marie Sklodovska.

So the holidays had come and Marie had the joy of taking home to Poland her wonderful result. She had other things to take home— presents! For this time she could spend all the money she had left, yes, everything, every penny. She could buy presents for her father, for Joseph, for Hela, and food for her 2,000 mile journey. It was the unbreakable custom with every Pole to arrive home penniless and laden with presents.

In the long summer, all over Poland, her relations feasted and fêted her. But the question that was eating at her heart was: what should she do about the autumn? Where and how could she raise a pound a week for another year at the university? Once more Mademoiselle Dydyuska turned up with her parasol. Whom she used it against this time, nobody knew, but she persuaded the authorities in Warsaw to grant a scholarship to the girl, who, she told them, would bring glory to their city. The great news came to Marie that she would have the Alexandrowitch bursary of £60. It meant another year's learning. Carefully she saved to make the bursary go as far as possible; carefully, after she was able to earn money for herself, she saved to return the bursary money, so that some other poor student might know the joy she had known. When, years after, the bursary secretary received the returned money he was greatly astonished, for no other student had ever thought of making such a return.

So back to work she went, to that work which was no drudgery, but the great love of her whole passionate being. That was the part of Marie's life she loved best, her hard student days, when, working in poverty and alone, with all the power of her youth, she was most herself. She has been called “the eternal student”—one of those people we meet in all the ancient stories of all the old universities: young, poor, greedy for knowledge, believing themselves gifted for some great purpose and driven to attain that purpose at any cost under high heaven.

Marie, working under her old oil lamp, knew herself one with the great scientists, the helpers of men. She had little to live on, but she lived greatly, gaily, thoughtlessly, rejoicingly. Truth was her daily fun, spoilt occasionally by a tragedy such as the final falling to pieces of a pair of shoes. to get a new pair would upset her spending for weeks; she would have to be hungrier than ever and colder. One night she was so cold that she took all her clothes out of her trunk and piled them on her bed. But she was still cold and there was nothing else movable to heap on her except the chair. So she dragged that on top and had to keep very still till morning lest her odd, warming scaffolding should fall off.

The water in her water jug might be ice in the mornings, but she loved those days so much that she wrote a verse about them:

Harsh and hard she lived to learn.

　Round her swirled the young who seek

Pleasures easy, pleasures stern.

　She alone, long week by week,

Happy, gay, made great her heart.

　When fleeting time took her away

From lands of knowledge and of art

　To earn her bread on life's gray way,

Oft times her spirit sighed to know

　Again the attic corner strait,

Still scene of silent labour slow,

　So filled with memory of fate.





Chapter IX　Marie's Love Story


MARIE was in a fix. It was not her first, and was not going to be her last. She had been given a most interesting piece of scientific work to do and she had nowhere to do it. The Society for the Encouragement of National Industry had asked her to make a thesis on the magnetic properties of different kinds of steel. It was just the work she loved. She had been getting on with it most successfully in Professor Lippmann's laboratory, but there simply wasn't room for all the heavy apparatus she needed. She had to analyse minerals and group examples of metals, and she hadn't any idea where she could get the loan of floor space. She told her trouble to a scientific Polish friend, M. Kowalski, who had come to Paris with his wife, partly on his honeymoon, partly to give scientific lectures.

Kowalski looked at her seriously. He saw that the matter was important, but what could he, a stranger in Paris, do about suggesting a room.

“I have an idea!” he exclaimed after a few moment's hesitation. “I do know a man of some importance who works in Lhomond Street at the School of Physics and Chemistry. He might have a room to lend, or at any rate he could give you some advice about it. Come and have tea to-morrow evening after dinner. I'll ask the young man to come along, too. He is well known; you must have heard his name, Pierre Curie.”

As Marie entered the sombre boarding-house room where the Kowalskis lodged she noticed at all young man standing in the embrasure of the balcony window. He looked very young, which surprised her because she was expecting to meet a man who had already made his mark. There was something original and very striking about the stranger, an ease, a grace, which seemed all the more marked under his loosely-fitting clothes. There was a clear transparency in the look with which he welcomed the girl to whom he was being introduced, which made him seem very honest, very simple, very young. She liked his grave, yet almost childlike, smile. They began at once to talk of science, for was not that why they had been brought together?

He was an unusual kind of man, the son of a doctor, who had realised, while Pierre was very young, that he was not the kind of boy who fits well into a mould that suits other people; Pierre wouldn't do for a public school, so he had a private tutor to himself. He had grown up a home-keeping boy, loving his father and mother's company and that of his only brother. He had taken to loving science, and also to delving into his own mind and writing down his opinions in his diary. “Women,” he wrote, when he was very young, “love life just for the mere sake of being alive far more than we men: women of genius are very rare. So when we give all our thoughts to some great work which separates us from the ordinary life around us, we have literally to fight against woman. The mother wants the love of her son even though, through loving her, he should make of himself an imbecile. A woman who loves would be ready to sacrifice the greatest genius in the world for the sake of the love of an hour.”

That was a bitter way to think of girlhood or of womanhood, but Pierre had his excuse. In addition to the fact that his observation was sometimes very true, he had had great grief connected with his first love, and he had made up his mind never to speak of it and never to marry. On that fateful evening when he talked science with Marie in the alcove, he was thirty-five. Inside France he was almost unknown, almost neglected, with that strange heart-breaking neglect with which France has the custom of greeting her greatest men, without all the same making them less great.

Outside France he was famous. A discovery that he and his brother had made which had helped to measure very minute quantities of electricity was used with gratitude by the greatest scientists of other countries. His own discovery of the principle of symmetry in crystals was to become a foundation of modern science. He had already given his name to a new balance and a new physical law. He was the honoured master of men like Lord Kelvin; but for all that he was getting only the wage of a superior workman, three pounds a week.

Still, his poverty was somewhat his own fault. He had been offered a post where money was the chief reward, but he had replied, “No, thank you, nothing is more unhealthy for the spirit than pre- occupations of that kind.” He had been suggested for government honours, and had begged to be excused and he had decided never to accept any decoration of any kind.

So this science-lover of stern and settled character stood before Marie and talked, his long, sensitive hand resting on the table, his still, clear eyes watching her with that deep, calm, detached inspection of theirs. Perhaps suddenly he remembered that old opinion of his—“Women of genius are rare.”

At first, conversation had been, as it would be when four people meet, quite general. Then Pierre and Marie had got on to science. Had she not come purely for scientific business? With a touch of deference, she questioned the great man who looked so young, and listened to his suggestions. Then he talked of himself, a thing he so rarely did, of his own aims and of his crystallography, which was puzzling and interesting him and whose laws he was seeking. A sudden thought darted through his mind: how strange it is to find one's self talking to a woman about the work one loves, employing technical terms and complicated formulas, and finding that woman, though charming and young, grow interested and keen, finding her understand, and finding her discuss details with faultless perception… What a delicious experience! He looked again at Marie, at her lovely hair, at her hands, made rough by chemical acids and housework, at her grace, at her absolute freedom from coquetry—so attractive and disconcerting a thing. That was the girl who had worked for years in Poland with the hope of reaching Paris, and was now there, working alone, penniless, in an attic.

“'Are you going to live in Paris always?” he asked.

“No, of course not,” replied Marie. “If I manage my examination this summer I shall return to Warsaw. I should like to come back in the autumn, but I don't know if I shall be able to afford it. In the end I shall teach in a Polish school and try to be useful. No Pole may desert her country.”

The conversation slipped off to the misery of Poland, to her oppressive masters. Pierre, whose one thought had been scientific discovery, listened surprised and distressed to a tale of human beings struggling to be free. Perhaps he thought of how great losses truth and knowledge may suffer when the scientists are obliged to give their thoughts away from science. Perhaps he began to dream that he must fight Poland and keep this rare genius for scientific Paris. At any rate, he was not going to lose touch with her. He took to meeting her at the Physics Society, where she went to hear about new discoveries. He sent her a copy of the limited edition of his own new book. He saw her from time to time at work in her linen overall among her apparatus in Lippmann's laboratory.

Then Pierre asked for Marie's address and called at 11 Rue des Feuillantines. Perhaps he remembered it as the street in which Pasteur had, also, once lived. As, after six flights of stairs, he entered the attic, the doctor's son was moved by the sight of the extreme poverty of the room. Yet how well it suited Marie! Never had she seemed so lovely as when she came to meet him in her threadbare frock across that almost empty room; so thin, so ascetic, so on fire, so stubborn, so self-willed she looked, so beautifully framed in emptiness.

All Pierre's bitterness went, like fog when the sun breaks through. They talked and he went back to work with quite another spirit; what had seemed to him little worth doing became more important and more clear. His new theory worked itself out into a most brilliant doctor's thesis and he made the discovery that one woman, at any rate, so far from killing genius in a man, had awakened it. He gave himself better to his high thoughts because he had given his heart to Marie.

But what of her heart? Pierre tried to find out. He took her into the lovely French country they both loved; together they gathered marguerites and brought them home to lend an air of whiteness and grace to the attic. He took her home to Sceaux, outside Paris, to meet his mother and his delightful old father. Marie found herself as if in a second home, a home oddly like hers in Warsaw, among calm, affectionate people who loved one another, loved books, loved nature and, above all, loved science. They talked of beautiful Poland, of Marie's long walks through its beautiful wide-spreading meadows, of her joy at the thought of the coming holidays there and among the Swiss mountains.

“But you are coming back in October?” exclaimed Pierre, a sudden chill clutching his heart! “It would be a sin on your part to abandon science.”

Marie was not deceived. She knew already that he meant it would be a sin to abandon him.

But Poland held her heart. Yet she said, looking shyly up at him, “I think you are right. I should very much like to come back.”

It was not long before Pierre felt brave enough to put his thought into words and to ask her to be his wife. But that she could never be, she said. She could never marry a Frenchman and turn her back on Poland. So many discussions followed that word, for Pierre knew that science was on his side and he could not believe that it was anyone's duty to give up science, which belonged to the whole world, for the sake of working for a mere country.

So Marie went home again for her holidays promising Pierre nothing but that he should always be her friend. He wrote her long persuading letters. He planned to meet her in Switzerland for a few days, but she was meeting her father there and he decided that his presence might spoil the girl's perfect holiday. He told her by post all his thoughts and his hesitations, never forgetting to slip in his opinion that the only dream that a man should live for was the scientific dream. “In politics,” said he, “you never know what you may be doing; you may be ruining your country while trying to help her. If you dream of helping humanity, you don't know how to do it. But science is solid. Any discovery, however small, that you make in that, remains made. Truth, once found, can't disappear and can never be wrong.

Believe me,

Your devoted,

Pierre Curie.”

Marie liked to write to him about her freedom.

“Talk!” he answered. “We're all slaves, slaves of our affections, slaves of prejudice, slaves when we have to earn a living, wheels in a machine, We have to yield something to the things around us! If we yield too much, we are poor mean things; if we don't yield enough, we are crushed.”

In October Marie returned to Paris, and it wasn't only she who was stubborn. What about that yielding to the things around one, about which Pierre spoke? He began to wonder if it should be he who should yield. The thought had no sooner come than he acted on it! He offered to give up Paris and to go to Poland. For a time he would give up science and teach French for a living; then somehow he would get back into scientific work.

Marie confided her hesitations to Bronia and asked her what she thought about that wonderful offer of Pierre's to give up his country. For herself, she felt that no one had the right to ask such a sacrifice of another. She was overwhelmed at the thought that Pierre had offered it to her. Pierre, too, went to the Dluskis. They were entirely on his side.

Bronia began to go with Marie to visit his parents, and heard from his mother so tender an account of the wonderful son Pierre was, that she knew that her sister's happiness would be safe in his hands.

Ten months more Marie hesitated, and then the two who had both promised themselves that they would never marry abandoned their high-flown ideas, and said yes to happiness.

Marie's brother wrote her a charming letter from Poland full of understanding. It was as if Poland itself spoke to tell the Polish girl that she could do more good to Poland by marrying a French scientist who happened to be Pierre Curie than she could by returning to be a schoolmistress in Warsaw. And, indeed, all that was about to happen showed that Marie had chosen the right.

So Marie could plan her wedding in all happiness; and what an odd wedding it was to be!

On the 26th of July, 1895, the sun rose in a clear sky, and Marie Sklodovska with it. Her beautiful face was lit with joy as she did her lovely hair and put on her new navy-blue dress with the striped blue blouse that Casimir Dluski's mother had given her. She hadn't wanted a real wedding dress; she was glad to have a new one because she only possessed one she wore every day, but she much preferred something useful that she could wear afterwards in the laboratory.

When she was dressed, Pierre fetched her and they left by the bus to catch the train to Sceaux, where the wedding was to be. Down the Boulevard St. Michel the heavy horses clop-clopped, passing the Sorbonne that the two looked at with loving eyes, for had it not brought them together?

At Sceaux there were to be no guests except Bronia and Casimir, Mr. Sklodovski and Hela, who had come all the way from Warsaw. They couldn't afford a gold ring or a wedding breakfast. For wedding presents, the most important were two shining bicycles, given them by a cousin, on which they were going to spend their honeymoon.

Said the one father to the other father, as they met the bride and bridegroom in the garden after the wedding, “You will have in Marie a daughter you can love, for since the day of her birth she has never given me a moment's pain.”





Chapter X　Madame Curie


PIERRE and Marie set out for an unusual honeymoon. They had no tickets to get and no rooms to reserve, because they were going off on bicycles just wherever their fancy led. They strapped a few clothes to the bicycles and, as the summer had been wet, two long rubber mackintoshes. Their tyres glided silently over the wet roads; bright, fitful sunshine flecked the tall trunks of the trees that make an avenue of all Frenck roads; overhead, the heavy summer leaves dappled the road with shade like a snakeskin and shook raindrops on the travellers from the last shower.

Upon what an adventure they were setting out, the two alone together! They couldn't see the end of it or imagine how exciting it was going to be, any more than they could see the end of the long avenue or know where they would sleep the night.

Pierre had always loved to wander in lonely woods. He liked them cool and wet, and, when he came out on to the rocky hillsides, he liked the smell of rosemary and marjoram and eglantine that made a wild jungle there. It was all one to him whether he walked by day or by night, by dawn or gloaming; whether he ate at eleven or three, seven or ten. Now all the things he cared for were lovelier still, because Marie was with him and she didn't bother him about time or punctuality.

They were not going to be extravagant; there should be no hotels for them. When they came to a village at evening, they found a simple inn, a place with one large tap-room, with a few tables and many chairs. The “Patron” spread a clean white cloth for them and brought them thick, hot soup. After dinner, they went up the creaking wooden stairs, along a rambling passage to a room where the light of one candle was not likely to show up the faded paper. French village inns are often like that; the supper is good, the bed is clean and delicious, and the charge small.

Next day after breakfast on coffee and rolls, they pedalled on along another highway under the trees with the forest on either hand. A long green ride that led into mysterious depths of trees tempted them; they dismounted and left their bicycles at a roadside cottage; saw that they had their compass safe, because it is easy to be lost in those great French forests; put apples in their pockets and found their feet sinking through soft moss into squelching mud. Lovely! For them, there was no such thing as direction, no such thing as time, and nobody to wonder when they would be back.

Pierre went in front, striding along absent-mindedly. Marie followed with shorter steps, but keeping up all the same. She was hatless, though at that time other women never walked without a hat. It wasn't the only fashion she was to set. Her skirt, which was meant to trail on the ground and plaster her shoes with caked mud, was gathered quite shockingly high into an elastic band, so that her ankles showed! Her shoes were thick and sensible and her leather belt had pockets for a knife, money and a watch. She could hear well enough what Pierre said, covering the ground there in front as if he had a train to catch. He was evidently talking to her, though, as he never turned his head, it might have been the tree she was addressing on the quaint customs of crystals. There is no conversation more learned or more difficult to follow than a conversation on crystals, or to put it more scientifically, on crystallography. Marie listened with joy, and her answers and remarks and suggestions were as clever as Pierre's, so that it seemed as if the two voices were the expression of one thought.

Marie was beginning to grow tired, when suddenly they came to an opening in the forest; and in the opening was a reedy pool. Marie threw herself down on the bank to bask in the sun, and Pierre went hunting like a small boy for what the pool might contain: dragonflies, tritons, salamanders. Far out in the water there were waterlilies; nearer at hand, yellow irises in bloom. He wanted them to decorate Marie, but there was no boat. A little way away a tree had fallen over the water—the very thing, a little slippery, perhaps, but what did a wetting matter to a lover? Luck was with him, however, and he was soon back arranging a crown of rather damp lilies and irises in his wife's hair.

Then, as if he had suddenly seen something to hunt, he crept on all-fours quietly close to the water again. Marie was not attending; it was so delicious to sit and do nothing in the August heat. Suddenly she screamed and looked with horror at her hand. A cold, wet frog was sitting in it!

“Don't you like frogs?” asked Pierre surprised; he had always liked them himself.

“Yes, but not in my hand.”

“What a mistake! They are such jolly things to watch. Look at him; isn't he handsome?”

But he relieved her of the handsome clamminess and let it go back to its pool to the joy of two of the party.

So they went on with the walk and the talk, Marie wearing her startling crown, till they reached the road again and their bicycles.

In mid-August, having gone round Paris by far woodland ways, they came to Chantilly in the north, a town buried in immense forests, where nowadays racehorses always peep at passers-by from their lordly stables. Marie and Pierre were due to join the family at a farm in the woods called “La Biche,” or The Hind. There they found Bronia, Casimir and baby Hélène, whom everyone called Lou; Grannie Dluska, Professor Sklodovski and Hela.

A farm in those woods has a charm of its own; never a sound comes near except the barking of a dog, the snapping of a branch, a woodman's distant axe against a tree-trunk, a hasty flutter of a startled pheasant or the skurry of a hare. Everywhere, as far as a man can walk or an eye can see, is an invitation to come in May, for the earth is hidden under the yellow, withering leaves of lilies-of-thevalley.

Inside the farm they talked apace, and often with Lou, who was beautiful, comic and gay and three years old. Sometimes they talked of solemn science with Professor Sklodovski and sometimes of the mysteries of bringing up children. Sometimes they discussed medicine and politics with Pierre's father and mother, who came from Sceaux on visits. France is the land for great talk, and often Marie was surprised to hear with what terrible vigour her French father-in-law and his friends talked politics. Politics were their very life; they cared intensely how their country was governed, and in free France they could say what they liked, which made their talk interesting. But Pierre was different. He disliked politics, because he said he was not clever at getting angry. But when a policy was unjust or cruel, he took sides—the side of the oppressed and persecuted.

So the honeymoon came to an end and Pierre and Marie settled to housekeeping in a Paris flat, and a strange, uncommon housekeeping it was! There were to be no visitors, so there were only two chairs. If a mistaken stranger toiled up the four storey's to pay a formal call and found the couple at home working, he had only to look round for a seat to see, without being told, that there was no place for him. The most pushing would beat a retreat in humbler mood. The Curies did not intend to have time to entertain. Marie, at any rate, would have, as it was, to do the work of two women: the work of a wife, which most wives find enough, and that of a scientist, which most scientists find more than enough.

She determined to make her home as simple and as little time-wasting as possible. There were to be no rugs to shake, no armchair or sofa to brush, nothing on the walls to dust, nothing to polish. The table, the two chairs and the bookshelf were of unpolished deal, which is a pleasant, untroublesome wood. The room depended on simplicity and a vase of fresh flowers for its beauty, while books, a lamp and piles of papers on physics showed it to be a scholar's den. Two people who loved one another, who loved Nature and learning, could desire nothing more. Yet they had to be fed. Doubtless that seemed a pity to them both, but Marie would not again neglect facts.

The first thing she bought to help her with her housekeeping was a black notebook with Accounts printed in letters of gold on the cover. She knew that faultless household arithmetic was a most important foundation of a happy home, especially of a home that had to be run on £240 a year exactly.

Her cooking would have to be faultless, too, or Pierre's digestion would go wrong. In addition, she had to find some scheme by which the dinner would cook itself while she spent most of the day at the laboratory doing science. Facts are fierce, strong things, but brains can use them against themselves. The first point was to make the day long. She got up early to go to market; she came home to make the bed and sweep the floor and prepare the evening dinner. Oh, that cooking! She had taken cooking lessons from Bronia and Madame Dluska before her marriage, but one doesn't learn much from lessons; mistakes are far better teachers. It was all very well that Pierre didn't know what he ate, and was as pleased when the dinner was wrong as when it was right, but Marie couldn't bear the idea that her French mother-in-law, a member of that famous cooking nation, might think that Polish girls couldn't cook. She read over and over again her book of recipes, she learned them as if they were science; she wrote notes in the margin and kept a record of her successes and failures. But there are things that printed recipes forget to tell you. Does one put beef to boil in hot or cold water? How long do beans take to boil? What keeps a stick of macaroni from sticking fast to the next piece? Those were mysteries needing a scientific experiment. Little by little, Marie grew clever; she invented dishes that could be left on the gas to cook while she was out; she calculated exactly the height of the gas flame that this or that stew would need for such and such hours; and, having set her burner exactly, she left the house and spent eight hours at the laboratory. Let no one say that a knowledge of science is no use for cooking.

When she walked home with Pierre in the evening, she bought the groceries or the fruit. Then at home, dinner over, her household work finished and expenditure entered in the notebook, she took out her books to study for another degree, and went on with it till two in the morning. It was a long day that stretched from 6.0 a.m. to 2.0 a.m. But still she was able to write to her brother: “All is well with us—health good and life kind. I am getting the flat gradually as I want it, but I intend that it shall be so simple it won't give us any worries or need any looking after, because I have very little help. A woman comes for an hour a day to wash-up and do the hardest part of the work.”

They had no excitements. They went frequently to see Pierre's parents at Sceaux, but they took their work with them and had two rooms set apart for them so that they might be just as if they were at home, just as hard-working. They scarcely ever went to the theatre and they went to nothing else. They could not even afford to go to Hela's wedding in Warsaw. They worked the year round with only a few days' holiday at Easter, till it was August again and Marie's examination in full swing.

Again she passed first on the list. Pierre threw an arm proudly round her neck and marched her home. No sooner had they arrived there than they pumped their bicycles, filled their bags, and set off for the mountains of Auvergne.

Marie wrote of that holiday: “What a radiant memory we have of a certain sunny day, when after a long, painful climb, we found ourselves crossing a fresh green Aubracian meadow in the clear air of those high tablelands. Another vivid memory is of an evening when we were caught by twilight in the gorge of the Truyère, and up the valley came, as by enchantment, a far-away melody from a boat disappearing down the stream. We had miscalculated our distances and couldn't get back to our beds before dawn. Then we met a string of carts whose horses took fright at our bicycles and obliged us to cut across ploughed fields. When we got back to the road high tableland was bathed in the moon's unreal light and the cows, in the paddock for the night, came gravely across one by one to gaze at us with their big, calm eyes.”

After holiday came work again, and life went on teaching Marie Curie as it had taught Manya Sklodovski, with great blows of hardship, that the best things in the world have to be paid for dearly.

Marie wanted a baby as much as she wanted Science, and as much as she wanted to be able to share everything with Pierre.

But she found that this time she just couldn't do everything. She could not stand eight hours studying the magnetization of steel, and she could not bicycle all day with Pierre among the blue bays of Brittany. She was surprised and disgusted to find that she had to yield to some things. When her father came from Poland on purpose to give her an early holiday, Pierre wrote her charming letters in simple Polish, because he was finding the language difficult, but was proud of his progress.

“My little girl, so dear, so sweet, whom I love so much. I got your letter to-day and I am very happy. Here, there is nothing new, except that I miss you; my very soul has fled with you.” And Marie answered, making her Polish easy for him: “It is fine. The sun is shining. It is hot. I am very sad without you. Come quickly. I sit watching from morn till eve and still you do not come. I am well. I work as much as I can, but Poincaré's book is harder than I expected. I must talk to you about it and we must go over together what I have found so hard.”

Then Irène came to add to Marie's work and joy. She called her her little queen; fed her herself; washed and dressed her, and would have done without a nurse had not the doctor ordered her to have one.

So now Marie had four things to take all her time instead of three: the laboratory, her husband, her house and her daughter. When she wanted to work, Irène was cutting her teeth and crying the house down; or Irène had a cold, or she had knocked her head, or she was a little feverish. Then both the great scientists, who happened to be her father and mother, had to sit up all night to watch a blue-eyed scrap. Sometimes, even when Irène was quite well, Marie, busy with science at the laboratory, would be seized with panic, leave her reports and rush off to the park to see if Nurse had mislaid her baby. No! There was Nurse pushing the pram with Irène safely inside. When Nurse left, Irène found a devoted slave in her grandfather, with whom Marie could leave her whenever the laboratory was having its turn.

But no one can wonder that Irène's mother grew thin. She was lucky, however, and thinness made her more beautiful than ever, with a sort of noble, ghostly beauty. She was almost unreal, as if the wind might have blown her away, except for her great brow and intense dreamy eyes.





Chapter XI　The Great Discovery


MARIE had been working at the laboratory like any other distinguished student of science. She had a double master's degree and a fellowship and had written a thesis on the magnetization of tempered steel. Still in front of her was the title that the most ambitious of the learned coveted—that of Doctor. To win that, it was necessary to discover something unknown before, to solve an unsolved problem. There were many unsolved problems, some of them might have no solution. A man might work a whole lifetime and at the end find that his time and his life had been thrown away. Nature, as Shakespeare says, has a great gift of “taciturnity.” What, among all things unknown, did Marie choose to try to know?

Pierre was the Head of her laboratory. He was the person whose advice she would take and, moreover, he was a physicist of great knowledge and experience. He would surely be able to suggest something which it was necessary to know, something which would help mankind when known and also lead on to further knowledge. Was there any dark ignorance which blocked some entrancing pathway of the route to knowledge? The two often discussed the question. But one day, turning over the pages of a scientific journal where the latest discoveries were discussed, Marie stopped short at the account of the work of a certain Henri Becquerel which had interested her and Pierre when it first appeared a year before. She read it again. She re-read it with care.

Things which have light in themselves! Things which have never caught light from the sun or even from the stars but which have light in themselves! Interesting? Marie was very interested.

Röntgen had then recently discovered new rays called X-rays and doctors had used them to look through human skin and see the things it hid. Then Poincaré had wondered if there might not be other rays, perhaps somewhat like X-rays which certain light-carrying bodies give off under the action of light. That question had interested Becquerel and he had studied certain substances to see if he could find those rays, supposing they existed. In studying a rare metal called Uranium, he had come upon something most surprising and most new: the salts of Uranium gave off rays without any contact with light at all; they were spontaneously light giving. No one had ever met such a thing before; no one could understand the strangeness of that light or explain it. Becquerel knew certain things about it: for instance, that a Uranium compound placed on a photographic plate surrounded by black paper, repeated the photograph through the paper and also used the surrounding air to discharge an electroscope. Surprising rays indeed!

Becquerel had discovered the fact that this strange radiation existed in the world. Marie determined to explain it. That should be the subject of her Doctor's thesis. The thing might be as small as it would, but it should not escape her. She would find out what that radiation came from, what was its origin and its cause, what, in fact, was its nature, or simply what it was. To find out what a thing is, is to explain it.

There were no books to refer to, except Becquerel's paper which had not gone far into the problem. Nobody in the world knew anything about her subject, so she could have no teacher. She was in for a wild adventure into an unknown world.

But just as an explorer, who plans to penetrate into the secrecy of the Brazilian forest, needs a ship to take him to the Amazon, so Marie needed a room in which her experiments could begin. It was not easy to find. Pierre enquired among his friends. But no one could think of anywhere suitable that was not used for something more important. Perhaps, suggested the Director of the School of Physics, the old storeroom on the ground floor would do. It was the home of spiders and their webs and cluttered up with machines and stores, but there was floor space.

In that odd corner, Marie installed herself. She was fortunately well accustomed to discomfort. In the winter she had to content herself with 11 degrees above freezing point. It didn't matter for her, but her instruments were more delicate and were apt to go wrong when they had to put up with hardships. They made difficulties when damp poured out of the walls and they needed an even temperature. Electrometers are highly sensitive things. Marie had to take their humours into consideration and make allowances for them.

So she began with her Uranium rays. What she had to do was to measure a certain capacity of theirs. She had to find out just how able they were to force the air to carry electricity and just how long it took them to discharge the charge of an electroscope.

Her electroscope was a metal case with two holes in its side. In it a vertical brass strip B was attached to a block of sulphur SS inside the lid—a good insulator. Joined to the strip B was a horizontal wire, ending at one end in a knob C and at the other in a condenser plate P'. Also attached to the strip B was a strip of gold leaf L. The metal case was connected to earth. A charge of electricity was given to the electroscope and then a substance to be tested was placed on a condenser plate P attached to the outer case. That substance would give conductivity to the air between plates P and P' and the charge of the electroscope would begin to leak away. As it leaked, the gold leaf L would fall gradually.



Marie watched what was happening through a miscroscope and a hole in the case. The time taken by the gold leaf to fall was in proportion to the strength of the Uranium rays. In a few weeks, she had become quite sure that the radio-activity of her Uranium the power of the rays—was in proportion to the quantity of pure Uranium in the specimens she placed on P and that it was not affected by the chemical make-up of the specimens or by light or temperature or anything outside itself. It was, so to speak, a very independent character, very much itself. What was it?

She could get no further in her investigation of this strange radiance by studying Uranium. Per-haps, she thought, this tiny, independent original character lives in something else besides Uranium? No one had ever found it elsewhere, but that was no reason for saying that no one ever would. Marie could but look. She determined to examine every known chemical substance. What a determination that was! Every known…!

And, in addition to every known chemical substance, there was a husband to be looked after and a house, and Irène to be dressed and fed and played with and taught. But Marie Curie knew all about work. A guess had floated into her mind, a guess that might have floated into anybody's mind, but hadn't, the guess that if Uranium gave light of itself, surely, in the great universe, there were other substances that did the same thing.

Yes, there were. Marie found another called Thorium. It was then that she gave the name radio-activity to this spontaneous giving out of light.

So she had gone through all the chemical substances known, those substances which, combined in myriads of different ways and proportions, make up the whole world. Two of them were radioactive; but why? What, indeed, was the explanation of their strange and beautiful power? She seemed no nearer to the explanation she sought, and what else was there to do when she had been through all known chemical substances.

Well, there were all the things in the world, in finished articles. Marie had a delicious gift of curiosity. She decided to go to the museum and start on the minerals. Those that contained Uranium or Thorium would be radio-active, of course, and those that had neither of the two would be inactive. Other people had recorded what the minerals were made of; Marie had only to take their records and begin with those that were suspect, with those, that is, which were related to the minerals containing Uranium or Thorium.

When she found an active mineral, she measured the amount of Uranium in it and the same for Thorium and then the radio-activity of the whole. One and one should have made two, but they made eight!

1+1=8 ! ! !

The radio-activity of the mineral she was examining was much stronger than the radio-activity of the Uranium and Thorium in it. Yet she knew by experiment that that was impossible. She had to do her experiments over again, because there must have been a mistake.

If there had been a mistake, she had made it again, because the result was the same. Over and over… and over… and over again, twenty times over, she did her experiment; but the result was always the same.

There could be but one explanation: the minerals must contain, in very small, unperceived quantity, a quite unknown substance which was very much more radio-active than either Uranium or Thorium.

So, in 1898, something existed which was absolutely unknown to man. Marie said to Bronia: “This ray, which I can't explain, comes from an unknown element… it is there; it has only to be found! We are sure of its existence, Pierre and I, but the Physicists, to whom we have spoken of it, think we have made a mistake in our experiments and advise us to be more prudent. But I am convinced that I am not mistaken.”

Marie was deeply excited; for what might not that unknown element turn out to be? She had written once: “Life is not easy for any of us—what does that matter? We must persevere and have confidence in ourselves. We must believe that our gifts are given to us for some purpose and we must attain to that purpose whatever price we may have to pay for it.”

On April 12th, 1898, Marie Curie published the formal statement: “Pitchblende and Chalco lite are much more radio-active than Uranium itself. This fact is very remarkable and leads us to believe that these minerals may contain an element which is much more active than Uranium...”

She believed in the new element, but she had to see it, to be able to show it to men's eyes. Pierre Curie, who up to that moment had been keenly interested in his wife's work and had constantly discussed it with her, gave up his own work and turned to labour side by side with her in the effort to bring to the light of day that hidden, secret element. Two minds and four hands were thence-forth going to fight the tiny thing. Marie had discovered that there must be the element. That was her share. After that she and Pierre shared equally in all the work to be done.

They chose a pitchblende to study because it was four times more active than the Uranium which it contained. Yet all the elements of pitch-blende were well known to all scientists. The unknown must, they argued, be very small to have escaped the notice of careful scientists. It might be a hundredth part of pitchblende, they suggested. What would they have thought at the outset of their work if they had guessed that it was only a millionth part?

They began to break up pitchblende into its elements and to measure the radio-activity of each separate element. As they worked, it became evident that radio-activity dwelt in two chemical fractions of pitchblende; there were two unknown substances. In July, 1898, they found one of the two.

“You must name it,” said Pierre to Marie.

Thoughts flashed through her mind. The discovery would be famous, it would be written about in all countries, therefore she would call it after her oppressed country, Poland. The fierce oppressors should know that Poland could give gifts to the world. She whispered to Pierre the substance's name: “Polonium.”

Then she went home to make fruit jelly, to wash and dress Irène, to write down the baby's weight in a diary and to record that she was cutting her milk teeth, that she could also make a sign with her hand to mean “thank you” and that she could say “gogli, gogli, go!”

But the time for holidays had come. Polonium and the unknown—that other one—were left in the damp laboratory and the baby, the bicycles and the scientists took train for the high hills of Auvergne. Among the little towns with their great cathedrals, their strange, spiked hills crowned with ancient chapels, their extinct volcanoes, two people walked and talked of that other, that something which no man or woman had seen. They looked from Clermont to the flat hill where the first French hero, Vercingetorix, had taught invincible Caesar the bitter taste of defeat. They walked in the town where Bertrand du Guesclin lay buried, he who had first made France feel she was a nation. They watched from the heights one of the most ancient roads go by, the “tin road” along which the Phoenicians had carried tin from uncivilized Britain to the cultured East. All past history seemed alive around them and in their minds, like a little restless star, twinkled the thoughts of that unknown and future thing whose power is still a mystery for us all.

In the autumn, the three Curies returned to work: Irène to produce more teeth and to learn to walk on two feet instead of four paws; and her father and mother to seek the stranger in the damp laboratory.

On December the 26th, 1898, in a paper for the Academy of Science, they announced quite quietly: “The new radio-active substance contains a new element to which we propose to give the name Radium… the radio-activity of Radium must be enormous.”





Chapter XII　A Light in the Dark


SO the mysterious and radiant stranger had a name, but no one had yet seen its face, not even Pierre and Marie who had given it its name of Radium. It had not, like all respectable and real substances, been touched, seen, put in a bottle, or even weighed. That question of weighing was very important. Weight—“atomic weight” —was to a scientist the very proof of existence. Something existing in the mind of Pierre and Marie, whose atomic weight even they did not know, was not scientifically there at all in the opinion of the scientists. No, Pierre and Marie had to get hold of Radium and weigh it. When they had done that, scientists would believe in it.

“It is in pitchblende,” thought the Curies, “and it is too small to be seen; but perhaps if we could get hold of an enormous quantity of pitchblende and extract all the Radium from it, we should have a piece large enough to see.”

But how were they to get hold of a really enormous quantity of pitchblende, say a hundred tons? And where could they put it if they had it? And how could they work on it even if they could house it?

The scientist takes one step at a time. First let them get hold of the pitchblende. They knew where great quantities were to be found, because the Bohemians used it in the manufacture of their beautiful glass; but it was expensive and the Curies had no money worth talking about. But the Bohemians did not, of course, make glass of pitchblende itself; they extracted Uranium from it for the manufacture of glass and threw out the useless dust in mighty powdery heaps in the forest of St. Joachimsthal. “Radium and Polonium,” said the Curies, “are not in Uranium; so they must be in that waste dust. Perhaps the manufacturers could be persuaded to sell their waste dust cheap.”

“Sell?” said the manufacturers kindly. “We'll give it to you if you will pay for taking it away.”Even that transport was expensive enough, but the Curies poured out their savings and sent them to Bohemia.

That was settled. The dust would be arriving, whole railway trucks of it. Where in the world would they put it?

Pierre and Marie went round to the great home of Science, the Sorbonne. Surely in that vast set of buildings, some unwanted room could be found for their valuable and exciting dust; but no! They had to go back to their own school of physics and even there nothing satisfactory could be spared them. The only place available was a shed on the other side of the courtyard from their laboratory. And what a shed! The glass roof was broken and the rain would rain through and upset any experiment that had to be kept dry. There was no floor, only a badly tarred surface; there was no furniture, except an old kitchen table or two, a blackboard and an old stove with a rusty iron chimney. In summer the workers would be cooked, because the roof was of glass. In winter, they would freeze when the outside world froze, because the stove gave no heat; or they would be soaked if it happened to rain. Not that that mattered much, for the room was not fitted with a fume cupboard to carry away the poisonous fumes, so that most of their work would have to be done out of doors. Still “Beggars can't be choosers,” says an old adage, so the Curies settled down to making the shed do.

The great morning came. The heavy cart horses with their bells and pointed black fur collars, brought their big coal cart to rest outside the school of physics. Perhaps they looked round surprised at the eager pair who rushed out hatless, in science overalls, with exclamations of joy to welcome their load. Not so was coal generally received.

But the load was not coal; it was sacks of brown dust. Marie could not wait for the sacks to be carried in; excitedly, in the street under the horses' solemn eyes, she seized the string with which one was tied and began to tear it undone. This was pitchblende! Her pitchblende! Or rather the part of pitchblende that mattered. Curiosity was in her heart, her eyes, her tingling, working fingers. At last, she was able to plunge both hands into the brown, dullcoloured dust and pine-needles from the Bohemian pine forest. Was Radium, the radiant stranger, really in that? Would she tind stars in the dust? Marie was going to get it out, even if she had to boil down mountains of that dingy dust.

The first ton of sacks was carried into the shed and the work began, four years' work, the best and happiest and hardest years of Marie's life.

In a great iron cauldron, she boiled down the dust, stirring it perpetually with an iron rod nearly as tall as herself. She stuck to her work all day long, even eating at the shed so as not to interrupt her task. She might have been seen any day, her hair blowing in the wind, her dusty overall flecked and tattered with acids, stirring her ill-tempered mud. She had chosen the man's work of hard manual labour out of doors, while Pierre sat at the table indoors trying to discover the properties of Radium by means of delicate, precise experiments. Sometimes she worked more than forty pounds of dust at a time, filling the shed with great pots of precipitates and liquids. She carried heavy weights, lifted pots to pour their contents into others and stirred and stirred the boiling cauldron.

After an entire day spent at the shed, with such hard work as that, Marie had her nursery work at home. She washed Irène and put her to bed and hoped to be able to go and sit in the study with Pierre. But Irène thought differently. No sooner was Marie's back turned, than a little piteous “Mé” came from the nursery… “Mé!” So back went Marie to sit with her baby till she slept. Pierre was not pleased about that; he wanted Marie's time too. But when Irène was asleep husband and wife sat together studying far into the night.

When to-morrow came, they worked again. Where was that Radium? Would they never see it? The days lengthened into months; the months were more than twelve and the second year was slipping into the third, and the third into the fourth. They worked as in a dream, thinking only of one thing, talking only of one thing.” What will it be like when we do see it?” asked Marie one day when she was taking a little time off to pace up and down the courtyard with Pierre.

“'I hope it will be a beautiful color,” said Pierre.

In 1900, a French chemist, André Debierne, came to help them and discovered, before ever. they had caught a glimpse of Radium or Polonium, a “brother” element which he called Actinium.

Time after time, the heavy horses brought more tons of pitchblende waste to the gate. Every day with her terrible patience, Marie was extracting from it a substance in which Radium was more and more concentrated. But still it hid, still it kept itself to itself and preserved its secret.

She had terrible patience, but difficulties were crowding in on the two. She and Pierre had not enough money to live and they had not enough time to work. Pierre had to do a great deal of teaching to earn the £240 on which they lived and that took time from Radium and still was not enough to pay their expenses and those of Irène's nurse. So Pierre tried to get a university post where his work would be more advanced and better paid; where, perhaps, he would have a real laboratory, equipped with electricity for his experiments and where he would not have so many lessons a day and so many wearying corrections at night.

But, unfortunately, posts are not always given to those who do the best work; they often go to the friends of the principal or to those who know the art of praising themselves. When an opportunity came to apply for such a post, Pierre was told that, according to custom, he must go and call on each member of the appointing commit-tee. He hated doing so. Shyly he rang the door bell, asked for the member, was shown in and sat down, but when the member came, Pierre was so shy that he praised his rival and not himself in the most glowing terms. Naturally, when the day of election came, it was the rival who was elected.

But something had to be done in order to live. Pierre was able to add to his salary by obtaining a humble post of £100 a year as tutor at the Poly-technique, one of the two most famous schools of France.

Just as he did this, the University of Geneva offered him his very heart's desire, a lectureship at the university, a beautiful laboratory, all the instruments and equipment he chose to ask for. He accepted and he and Marie went to Geneva. But when they got there, they knew that they could not desert Paris, could not, simply could not, abandon Radium, that child of theirs. However badly Paris treated them, only in Paris could they work at Radium. So with apologies, Pierre abandoned his wonderful post at Geneva and returned to Paris, poverty and Radium.

We next find the two rejoicing because Pierre had obtained a post in the School of Physics, Chemistry and Natural Science and Marie one to teach girls in the Sèvres training school for elementary teachers. They were lucky young women who had Marie Curie to teach them, but it was sad that the world did not realise that the work she was doing on Radium could only be done by her, while many people might have taught Science at Sèvres. Marie prepared her lessons with the greatest care and won much praise, because they were the most original and the most fascinating lessons any of the girls had known. But her long tram rides several times a week tried her and wasted precious hours; so did the preparation of schoolgirl lessons and the weary marking of papers. It was like setting Rembrandt to paint gate-posts. Both Pierre and Marie were wearing themselves out. Would they ever see Radium?

Marie also had forgotten her good resolution to feed well after her marriage. “You scarcely eat, either of you,” wrote their doctor to Pierre. “I have more than once seen Madame Curie nibbling two thin rounds of sausage and washing it down with a cup of tea. Do you think that even a strong constitution won't suffer from such starvation?… I know what your excuse will be: ‘she is not hungry and is old enough to know what is good for her.’ She isn't! She's behaving like a baby. I am speaking with all the conviction of my friendship. You don't spend enough time on your meals…You mustn't read while you eat, or talk Physics...

One gets the impression that neither Pierre nor Marie paid the slightest attention to the doctor's good advice. There was that Radium to be brought to life in the shed of the Rue Lhomond and nothing else mattered.

At one moment Pierre suggested that they should devote themselves to a study of the proper-ties of Radium and abandon the effort to see the thing itself, but Marie would not listen.

She was getting nearer. She had ceased to boil down the rough dust. She had obtained from it something which could be kept indoors, something which, in a small space contained all the Radium of the many tons. to work upon it further, she needed delicate instruments, a science room in which there was neither dust nor damp, neither cold nor heat, nothing to upset an accurate experiment. But she had no such room, and dust, heat, cold, wind constantly undid what she did and forced her to waste time and energy doing it again. She had terrible patience.

It was the year 1902. Three years and nine months had passed since Marie had announced the probable existence of Radium. At last she had conquered the radiant stranger. She had seen stars in that dust; she had seen Radium. She had made one decigramme of it. It had weight. It had the atomic weight of 226. Chemists bowed to it.

Marie and Pierre were sitting at home in the evening and Irène had been put to bed. That four year old tyrant had consented to shut her eyes and let Mé go back to Pierre to finish making the tyrant's dress, for Mé made all Irène's clothes. Suddenly Marie put down her work: “Let's go back!” she said.

Pierre needed no asking. They had left their Radium only two hours but they longed to see it again. They wanted it as if it were a new baby. They called to Grandfather Curie that they were going out and then, arm-in-arm, through the crowded streets, past the factories of their un-fashionable district, they made their way back to Rue Lhomond and their shed.

“Don't light up,” said Marie. “Do you remember the day when you said you would like Radium to have a beautiful colour?”

In the dark of the shed, Radium had something even more lovely than colour. It had light!

“Look! look!” whispered Marie, as she felt her way to a chair and sat gazing round her.

There were tiny points of light in the dark room, like pale blue moonlight dancing on water, specks of light that were never still. On the table, on the shelves were those strange, mysterious radiances. In its little receptacles there was Radium visible at last, visible by its own light in the dark.





Chapter XIII　Not for Sale


THE whole world was excited! Something entirely new had come into people's everyday life, something that made them change their thoughts about many things. It was not only scientists who talked about Radium: children discussed it on their way home from school; women, who had been disappointed for long, long ages because men had made all the greatest discoveries, rejoiced aloud, that at last it had happened to a woman to discover a new and wonderful thing. But, at first, no one dreamed how wonderful Radium was going to be.

Letters came in packed masses to the two Curies from famous scholars in England, Denmark, Germany and Austria, asking for information about the new discovery. Scientists everywhere took up the study of Radium and found out more about its characteristics and those of its near relations. Two Englishmen, Ramsay and Soddy, found that it threw off from itself tiny quantities of a new gas, which they called Helium. In other words, Raduim had the capacity of becoming Helium. That was something very startling. Scientists had been accustomed to laugh at the Medieval Alchemists who believed that they could turn iron into gold. A picture of the alchemist's mysterious smoky cave was a picture of a dream of the impossible. Things, the scientists had said, were themselves, with their own chemical composition and their own atomic weight. Now they had to face the fact that Radium made Helium out of itself, and they wondered what other things might also be occupied with creating new substances. Perhaps the ghosts of the alchemists were laughing at the chemists.

At any rate, to turn iron into gold was no more remarkable a feat than the feats of which this Radium was capable. It looked like dull table salt, but it was two million times more radiant than Uranium. The rays that it gave out could go through every solid metal except lead. It was accompanied by its shadow—a spirit that was so alive and active that even when it was shut up in a glass tube, it destroyed a quarter of itself in a day. It could produce heat of itself, enough heat to melt in an hour a piece of ice of its own weight. If you shut it away from the cold, it would grow hotter than the day. If you shut it in glass, it would turn the glass mauve or violet. If you wrapped it in paper or cotton wool, it ate them. If you had no candle in the dark, it gave you enough light to read by.

One of the most wonderful things about this Radium was that it did not even stick to its own light; it handed it on to everything, that came in its way, even though such generosity was often most inconvenient.

It showed a sudden interest in human affairs in that it lent its luminosity to real diamonds, but turned its nose up at paste. Diamond buyers could use it to test the genuineness of their purchases.

Poor Marie found its interference in all her experiments most distracting. Nothing could be left near a tube of Radium without becoming radio-active; it presented its luminosity to the air, the dust, Marie's clothes, her instruments, her notebooks. Those last kept the luminosity they had not been able to refuse, long after she was dead.

Scientists probably enjoy having their ideas upset, so those early years of the baby Radium must have been happy ones for them. Not only did that strange Radium create a new element out of itself, but that new element again made something new, and so on. The radio-elements formed strange faculties in which each member was created by the transformation of the substance of its mother. But the scientists' shocks did not end there. They found that each radio-element lost half of itself in a given time, a time which was always the same, a time so long that we need not worry about finding ourselves bereft of the radio elements. Uranium, to lose half of itself, takes a few milliards of years, and a milliard is a million-million. To do the same thing, Radium takes only 1,600 years, while its spirit takes only four days and its spirit's children only a few seconds.

You could look at Radium and see it lying quite still and yet know that, while you were gazing at it; its strange children were being born, were being murdered or committing suicide, or merely colliding with one another.

Then suddenly something altogether new happened to this active stranger as if enough things hadn't happened already. Pierre, exploring still, let it burn him. The skin of his hand became red but didn't hurt. It became redder. On the twentieth day a crust formed as on an ordinary fire burn. Then a sore appeared. On the forty-second day the sore began to heal on the outside edge.

Then Marie, though she had not meant to burn herself, found that her Radium had burnt her, though it was in a glass tube and the tube was in a tin box.

Then their friend Becquerel, going home with a tube of it in his jacket pocket, was quite seriously burnt.

“Your abominable child.” he exclaimed to Marie. “What has it burnt me for? I love the thing, but I've a bone to pick with it.” Marie, too, might have had a bone to pick with the thing she loved, because the tips of her fingers hurt horribly and lost their skin.

But soon people began to look kindly on Radium's burns because they healed so well. Doctors became immensely interested in it. They set it to burn away terribly sick skin and, when the burn was healed, the illness had gone too. A wild great hope began for the world. Perhaps Radium could be persuaded to burn away cancer.

At any rate, Radium had been proved to be useful People were wanting to buy it. Marie, out of eight tons of pitchblende had made one gramme of Radium. It was worth £30,000, but it was not for sale. Marie would treasure it while she lived and leave it to her laboratory as a precious symbol of years of great work and a great triumph.

One Sunday morning as Pierre and Marie were sitting at home in the Boulevard Kellerman, the postman left a letter with an American stamp for Pierre. He read it carefully, folded it, and put it on his desk.

“We'll have to talk,” he said, “about this Radium. It is going to be manufactured on a large scale. They have written from Buffalo to ask for information about it.”

“Well?” Marie was a little bored.

“Well, we can choose… We can describe quite openly and frankly all our results and methods of making it…”

“Of course,” smiled Marie.

“'Or,” went on Pierre, paying no attention to the interruption, “we can consider ourselves as the owners of our knowledge, the inventors of Radium. If we do that, before we publish our method of extracting Radium from pitchblende, we must take out a patent and draw a profit from the manufacture of Radium in the whole world.”

As he spoke, it was quite clear to them both that immense wealth was theirs for the accepting. A patent on the manufacture of Radium would give them enough money to build a great laboratory and to buy Radium for research. What things they could do if they were rich!

Marie thought for a little, and then said: “That is impossible; that would be against the spirit of science.”

Pierre agreed, but he told her to think carefully, because the decision once made could not be reconsidered. He reminded her about the laboratory they both wanted and about the future of their daughter. Was she sure she did not want to be rich?

Marie knew the great old custom of the scientists, the custom that people like Pasteur had followed, and she said: “Physicists always publish their researches. It is only a chance that our discovery has a money value. We can't use a chance like that for profit. And Radium is going to help the sick. It seems impossible to me to seek any profit from it.”

Again Pierre agreed that it would be contrary to the scientific spirit to sell their knowledge of Radium. He wrote that very night and gave the Americans all the information they wanted.

So, without a moment's regret, Pierre and Marie turned their backs for ever upon the millionaire's faery fortune. Their Radium was not for sale.

The scientific spirit had given Radium to them and to the world, and however low the spirit of the world sinks, it still loves the scientific spirit which gives all its knowledge freely to all men without price. Having chosen poverty when they might have chosen fortune, Marie and Pierre took their bicycles and went for thier ordinary ride through the summer woods to gether wild flowers for their room.





Chapter XIV　Darkness


MARIE and Pierre were famous. France offered them prizes. England sent them an invitation. They carried from France a gift for their English friend, Lord Kelvin, a gift of a tiny particle of radium in a glass phial, which he showed with childish glee to his scientific friends. Pierre was to lecture on Radium to the Royal Institute, and Marie was to be the first woman ever to be admitted to a meeting of that severe and splendid Society. Never had there been so gay a lecture there, for Pierre made the wizard Radium show its strange tricks to the solemn assembly of all the most learned Englishmen. The Royal Society was enchanted, and all London was agog to see the two “parents” of radium. There were banquets in their honor, and the noble and the rich glimmered in pearls and diamonds as they gazed in astonishment at that strange thing—a woman scientist, who dined at night in a simple black dress unrelieved by a single jewel, and whose hands, scarred with acids, were bare of any ring; but she looked no less distinguished than they, with her thin figure, her inspired face, and her great pale forehead over those intense eyes. Marie, herself, loved the glitter around her, but she was a little surprised to see the usually indifferent Pierre apparently absorbed in the dazzling scene.

“Aren't jewels pretty things?” she asked him. “I never dreamed such lovely ones existed.”

Pierre laughed. “Do you know,” he said, “at dinner I hadn't anything to do with my mind so I spent the time working out how many laboratories could have been built and equipped with the price of those jewels!”

No! The Curies were certainly “different.” They understood a substance that gave out its own light, but not jewelled reflectors. They didn't even know what to do with a gold medal when the Royal Society honoured Marie with the Davy Medal. Pierre gave it to Irène as a thoroughly safe and biteable plaything, and she adored it.

They knew still less what to do with fame and crowds and applause and journalists. Marie could only be miserable about them.

On December 10th, 1903, she was awarded half the Nobel Prize for Science. Henri Becquerel had the other half. She was the first woman to be thus honoured in science, but not a word of excitement escaped her. She rejoiced in the real part of the prize: the recognition by her fellow-scientists of her work and the gentle pleasure of having some money to spend; but the glitter and the tinsel, fame, letters of congratulation from strangers, demands for autographs, requests for interviews from photographers and journalists—those things she hated. “I would like to bury myself to get a little peace,” she wrote.

She enjoyed spending the money, and how she spent it showed her in all her sincerity and charm. She banked some of it, so that the family income from it might pay someone to help in the laboratory and also enable Pierre to give up his teaching at the School of Physics and so have time to do research. She gave a large gift to the sanatorium which the Dluskis had founded in Poland. She gave presents to Pierre's brother and her own sisters; she paid subscriptions to scientific societies; she helped some Polish students, her laboratory boys, and a Sèvres girl who was in need. Then she remembered an old French teacher of her own who lived in Poland, who had a lovely, impossible day-dream—that of visiting just once again her dear France. Marie wrote to her, sent her the money for her journey, and invited her to come and stay with her. The old woman wept with joy at the immense unexpected pleasure. Last of all, Marie gave herself a present—a modern bathroom in her house in the Boulevard Kellerman, and new paper for one of her sitting-rooms.

But oh! The foolish crowd! Instead of collecting money to build a laboratory so that the Curies might find out more about Radium, they wasted Marie's time, forced her to play hide-and-seek in the street in order to get into her own house unmolested; published in the newspapers all the little details of their home-life that the Curies loved and would have liked to keep to themselves, even the baby-words that Irène said to her nurse, even the colour of the roof cat. Marie exclaimed, “They prevent our working. Our life is spoilt with honour and glory!” And she meant it. She was shy, and very busy, and the senseless crowd was making her really ill. Once, when the Curies were dining with the French President, a lady went up to Marie and asked if she should present her to the King of Greece. “I don't see the necessity,” said Marie, gently, and then perceived, in an overwhelming glance, that the lady was Mme. Loubet, the wife of the President, and that she was very surprised indeed. “Of course… of course, naturally I'll do anything you like,” she stammered, blushing. To meet kings is a pleasure to so many people, but Marie was different. She was tired and she was young. She wanted a holiday, just to be gay and free and happy, and to be an ordinary mother and an ordinary wife. She wished Irène's whooping-cough wouldn't take so many months to go away and that Pierre's illness wouldn't frighten her. Since she had danced in Poland twenty years before, her life had been nothing but work, and never had she so longed to do nothing, to forget that she was the famous Mme. Curie, and to be mere Manya again and eat too many strawberries and sleep and do nothing.

But Pierre was in a hurry. There was so much work to do. He couldn't understand Marie's holiday spirit—that was something altogether too girlish, altogether too unscientific. They must devote themselves to science, he told her, and she obeyed. She always obeyed him. But she was terribly tired, so tired that she almost didn't want her new baby, Eve. “Poor little thing,” she said, “to have to live in so hard a world as this.” It was indeed a cruel thing that the hunters and pursuers should have taken all her gaiety and courage, even from Manya.

But Eve did her good, for she loved very new babies, and she was obliged to have the month's holiday that Eve gave her—Eve, with the dark hair and blue eyes, who was so different from Irène, of the fair hair and hazel eyes. Eve wouldn't lie in her cradle, but protested vigorously, and Marie was not a model mother who left her to cry, but a soft-hearted one who took her up and carried her about till she slept.

Just before the coming of Eve, an odd privilege had been granted to Marie by the University of Paris, the right to work in Pierre's laboratory. She had been working there all the time, but suddenly the University woke up and gave her an appointment which allowed her to do so—the appointment of “Physics Organiser” under M. Curie at a salary of £96 a year. The University acknowledged, what everyone else had known for a long time, that the Curies always worked together. All their time and their thoughts and their work were quite naturally shared, just as if they were one happy person.

In June, 1905, Pierre and Marie went to beautiful Stockholm, where Pierre had to make a speech, in both their names, in connection with the Nobel Prize. He described Sweden rather. charmingly, as composed of lakes and fjords surrounded by a little dry land, and the two enjoyed the uncrowded calm of the vast spaces and the courtesy of a nation which did not press upon them.

But Marie sometimes made friends with strangers. There was an American baller dancer, Loïe Fuller, who used strange lighting to make her dancing more beautiful. She wrote to Marie to ask how she could use Radium to light her butterfly wings. Pierre and Marie laughed at the wild idea, but wrote back very gently explaining the queer thing that was Radium. Loïe replied that she had only one way of thanking them for their letter—to come and dance to them in their own home. The Curies accepted that uncommon thanks, and on the day there appeared at their door an odd-looking girl with baby-blue eyes and an army of electricians. All day the electricians worked. By the evening the Curies' dining-room was transformed into a fairyland of strange lights, and Loïe danced, making herself by turns flame, flower, bird, and witch.

The little music-hall dancer became a great friend, and took the Curies to introduce them to her friend, Rodin, the great sculptor, and there, in his studio, among the casts and marbles, Science, Sculpture and Dance would sit and talk the evening out.

Then came April, 1906. The hot sun of April in France drew their scent from the violets, purple and white, that coloured the hedgerows in the valley of the Chevreuse. Marie and Pierre, Irène and Eve, were on holiday. In the evening they fetched the milk from the farm; Eve, the little mountebank, making them all laugh as she tottered in the dry cart-ruts. In the mornings, Pierre and Marie, on their bicycles, hunted flowers through the woods and revisited the pond, which they had met on their honeymoon. It was dry and the water-lilies had gone, but yellow-flowering reeds circled the mud with a bright startling crown. And Marie and Pierre, wandering home, gathered violets and powder-blue periwinkle from the banks of the sunken lanes.

At noon on another day they lay in the sun and dreamed, while Irène chased butterflies with a green net, greeting them with high-pitched cries and squeals of glee.

“Life has been sweet with you, Marie,” murmured Pierre.

Then, after dinner, he caught the train to Paris and work, carrying with him the yellow ranunculus they had gathered by the pond. The others joined him the next day, and April, as is the way with April, had turned wet and cold.

The day after Marie and the children came home was April the 19th, 1906—a wet day, with muddy, slippery streets, a cloudy day and dark. Pierre had several engagements in the city; Marie had to get the house in order after the holidays, and many things to do in town. Busily, gaily, she went hither and yon. Six o'clock found her back on her own doorstep, happy to be home again, eager to meet Pierre and to begin another of those delicious evenings working with him at scientific calculations.

She opened the drawing-room door. Three men rose and stood, with deep respect in their attitude; just that, as if she had been a queen; and in their eyes she read a terrible pity. Paul Appell, her old teacher, had to tell her that Pierre had slipped in the street and the wheel of a heavy horse-drawn dray had crushed his head.

“Pierre is dead?… dead? Really dead?” she said.

When Eve grew up, she told us, in the lovely life she wrote of her mother, that from the moment she spoke the words “Pierre est mort,” a cloak of solitude and secrecy enveloped Marie, and that from that April day for ever she was a person apart and lonely.





Chapter XV　Whatever Happens


MARIE was born to have glorious courage. All her life she had had to call upon her valiancy, and it had grown strong and would not fail her. Moreover, she had truly loved a great man, and Pierre had left her a word to remember and to obey when her world fell to pieces around her. “Whatever might happen,” he had said, one day when they were talking of death, “whatever might happen, and even though one might be like an empty body, whose spirit was dead, it would be one's duty to go on working all the same.” So Marie, fortunately, had to go on working. When a pension was offered her, she refused it, saying she was young enough to earn for herself and her children.

She found an odd little way of comfort which seems to make her all the dearer to us: she wrote her diary as if she were speaking to Pierre:

“They have offered to let me take your place, my Pierre: your lectures and the direction of your laboratory. I have accepted. I don't know if I have done right or wrong. You have often told me that you would like me to give a course of lectures at the Sorbonne. And I would at least like to try to continue your work. At one moment that seems the easiest way to go on living; at another I seem a fool to undertake it.”

“May 7th, 1906:

“My Pierre, I think of you all the time; my head is bursting with the thought of you, and my reason fails. I can't understand that I have to live without you and that I can't smile at my dear life's companion. The trees have been in leaf two days now and the garden is beautiful. This morning I was admiring the children in it. I thought how beautiful you would have thought them and that you would have called me to show me that the periwinkles and narcissus were out…

“May 14th: I want to tell you that they have nominated me to your chair of Physics at the Sorbonne and that there are people imbecile enough to congratulate me on it.” Marie was not too crushed to feel fierce rage at fools.

No woman had ever had the honour of a university chair at the Sorbonne; that is, no woman had been made head of a teaching staff in any subject. But there was no man in France capable of taking over Pierre's work, so it fell naturally to Marie. She alone of living scientists had the genius for it. She determined that her lectures should be worthy of Pierre, so she sent the children to the country and stayed all summer in Paris working on Pierre's subject, on Pierre's notes.

She needed another house and decided to go and live at Sceaux where Pierre was buried. The children's grandfather was a little scared that, when she moved to a smaller house, she would not want him. How could he ask the question? Marie was also a little scared that he would not want to live with a mere daughter-in-law now that his son was dead. The old man tackled the difficult question: “Now that Pierre isn't here, Marie, you have no reason for living with an old man. I can quite well go and live with my eldest son. It is for you to decide.”

“No, you must decide,” Marie whispered. “If you go, you will grieve me. But you must choose what you prefer.”

“What I prefer, Marie, is to stay with you always.”

But the day had to come when Marie would have to go outside her home again where everyone treated her grief with tenderness and respect, and face the outside world where she was now an exciting and famous widow. She knew that the newspapers were asking the Sorbonne to change its rules and make her lecture in the great amphitheatre so that many thousands might hear the first woman to lecture in the Sorbonne. She was probably glad that the Sorbonne was one of the most conservative places on earth and was not likely to change its rules. She had heard that the fashionable crowd, that wished to be present, were discussing what she would say and how she would refer to her husband, because it was the university custom for every new holder of a chair to praise his predecessor. It was the custom to thank the Minister, to thank the university. When the day of its inaugural lecture came, the crowd was waiting, like birds of prey, to hear Marie say something moving, perhaps to see her break down. It was the small amphitheatre, but they thronged it, crushing the real students who were there to learn, even pushing them out of their seats.

Marie entered quickly amid deafening applause. As soon as there was silence, she began her lecture in advanced Physics simply at the place where Pierre had left off: “When we consider the progress which has taken place in physics during the last ten years, we are surprised at the change in our ideas concerning electricity and matter…

The audience was surprised indeed, but at the change in their ideas about something other than electricity. They had gone to see a show; they found themselves meeting a woman, who was no show, but a truly sincere human being who thought more about her work than about herself. They were touched. Tears welled up into their eyes. Marie spoke of the new theories of the structure of electricity, of the disintegration of the atom and of radio-active bodies. At the end of her lecture, which was addressed purely to the students, she left the hall as quickly and as simply as she had entered it.

If her work had been hard before, it became harder. She had to think out how to educate the little girls. She had her work of discovery in the laboratory and her lectures at the Sorbonne. She had her house and garden to see to and, above all, she had a special work of her own to do. She had by some means to get a laboratory built in honour of Pierre, something wonderful and perfect it was to be—the laboratory of his dreams.

Eve and Irène played with their blue-eyed grandfather in the new house at Sceaux. He taught Irène botany and natural history and poetry, and helped her to dig her own garden patch and to plant the right flowers, while Eve made friends with her pet tortoise in the grass or romped with the black or with the tabby cat.

But Marie hastened early in the morning, with that quick, business-like step of hers, to catch the Paris train and did not return till the lights were lit in the evenings. The children did not see much of their mother, but it was she who planned the day the children spent. They had to work for an hour at the beginning of the morning. Irène loved figures and Eve music. After that, they went for a walk in all weathers and then to gym, which they loved. Then they cooked or modelled or sewed or gardened or, on a Saturday and Sunday, or in the holidays, they went out bicycling or swimming with their mother. She meant them to be strong and fearless. They were not allowed to be afraid of the dark or of accidents or of climbing, or of riding, or of animals or of anything. Brave and bold they should be and French. She taught them Polish, but she did not want them to have the unhappiness she had had of feeling themselves part of two nations and one a sad and persecuted country. Only one thing she left out of their educationm—the art of welcoming strangers and being charming at parties. In those things, they had no practice.

Marie did not want her children overworked and hours in French schools are very long, sometimes six hours at school followed by three hours' homework.

Marie and her university friends often talked on the subject and they decided to pool their children and teach them themselves. It was a glorious idea. Those lucky children were to have one lesson a day, but it was to be given by the greatest specialist in Paris. On the first morning they were to go to the Sorbonne laboratory where Jean Perrin taught them chemistry. “The Sorbonne hasn't yet been blown up,” said the newspaper, “but we haven't yet lost all hope.” On the next day they went into the country to be taught mathematics by Paul Langevin; on the next to the sculptor, Magrou, to learn modelling; on another to a professor of modern languages and literature, and on Thursday afternoon to the School of Physics to be taught by Marie Curie. Lucky brats!

In that stately place which had never before heard an easy lesson, they dropped inky bicycle bearings on sloping white boards to see with their own eyes the curves that falling bodies make. Or, Marie asked them such dark questions as: “What must I do to keep the heat in this liquid in this pan?”

“Wrap it in wool,” said one.

“Isolate it,” suggested another.

“I,” smiled Marie, “would begin by putting on the lid.”

Unfortunately however, parents have to be busy earning the family income and have no time to give their own children enchanting lessons. Those delicious lessons ceased, and Eve and Irène went to school where the hours were not quite so long as in most schools. They said in after-life that from those early lessons they learnt to like work, to be indifferent to money and to be so independent that they were convinced that they could pull themselves out of any difficulty.

In the laboratory, among many new triumphs, Marie had one very great triumph. Up to that time she had made only the salts of Radium. On one occasion she and André Debierne succeeded in making Radium metal. They succeeded once. Neither they nor anyone else has ever done it again.

In 1911 Marie was awarded the Nobel Prize for Chemistry. No person before her had ever received two Nobel prizes.

One would have thought that all the world would have gloried in her as a scientist and treated her gently as a sad woman. But, unfortunately, there is a strange disease which causes certain people to feel very cruel when they hear of someone being very successful or very beautiful. Marie was both, and suddenly people began to write her anonymous letters and to tell extraordinary lies about her and to accuse her of doing wrong. things of which she had never dreamed. Her friends tried to protect her; but it is difficult to fight against enemies who hide. They felt that the best protection would be for the Academy of Science to give her an open honour by making her a member. It was her due, but no woman had ever been a member. The liars redoubled their efforts to prevent the election. They even went the length of putting a false voting paper into the hand of a blind man, her friend, so that he might seem to oppose her. The Academy of Science, to its lasting disgrace, rejected her by one vote.

Marie was terribly unhappy about the lies. For a time she had to borrow her sister's name to escape from her enemies. She was as open as the day and this attack from the people who skulked in darkness made her ill. It almost destroyed that famous courage of hers, but not quite. She was very ill and in great pain. The surgeons said an operation would save her from pain, but she told them to wait till after she had attended the next Physics Congress. Her courage was still there.

Then when she was still ill there came to her a great decision to make. She was tired and wanted not to have to think, but Poland had decided to build a great laboratory of radio-activity at War-saw, and invited her to be the head of it. How she longed to accept! What an invitation it was! She was told that Poland needed her, that her country was growing discouraged and needed something to make it believe in itself again.

But long years before Marie had decided that greatly though she loved Poland, she loved Pierre Curie more. She still loved him more, and Poland and he were still pulling in opposite directions. If Marie gave herself to Poland, she would have to give up the hope of building Pierre's laboratory. Without her presence in France, Pierre's dream would never come true. She refused Poland sadly.

But Poland insisted that she should direct the new laboratory from a distance and go to the opening of the new building. Many exciting things befell her during that visit. First, she gave an address on Science in Polish, and it was the first time in her life that she had ever used her own tongue for a scientific speech. Secondly, she attended a great ceremony in the museum where she had done her first Physics experiments. Thirdly, at a banquet given in her honour by Polish women, she discovered the old headmistress of her first school. Hurriedly, Marie made her way through the crowd to the old lady and kissed her on both cheeks. What joy that old head-mistress must have felt at the thought that her “old girl” was without question the most famous woman!

Marie had earned a holiday. She was going to spend it walking in Switzerland with a rucksack on her back and teaching Eve and Irène to climb and to treat crevasses with proper respect.

They had a friend with them who talked Physics so enthusiastically with Marie, that the children had to keep watch over him lest he, not they, should fall into a crevasse. They listened with surprise to the odd things he said to their mother, and laughed so much that there was no one to look after the crevasses.

“You see, Madame,” they heard him say, “what I need to know is: what exactly happens to the passengers in a lift when it falls in a vacuum?” The question seemed easy to answer to Eve and Irène and very amusing. They did not guess that they were listening to that incomprehensible subject called “Relativity,” for the careless friend was none other than the great Einstein.

At that time, Marie was becoming happier again, because the walls of Pierre's Radium Institute were growing in the Rue Pierre Curie. Dr. Roux, the head of the Pasteur Institute, had pro-posed two years before to raise the money for a laboratory for Madame Curie. That made the Sorbonne wake up to the fact that the Pasteur Institute was thinking of snatching their Madame Curie from them, and, to prevent such a catastrophe, they agreed with the Pasteur Institute to share in the building of the new laboratory.

Marie was full of joy. She helped to make the plans, discussed the shape of all the rooms and windows with the architect, and insisted on having immense windows and overflowing light. She also insisted on the garden and planted the trees and roses with her own hands before the building began, so that they might be making a little show when it was opened.

In July, 1914, she was able to read on the stone over the door:

Institut du Radium Pavillon Curie.

She tells us that she thought of Pasteur's words: “If you care for those conquests that are useful to men… if you are jealous of the part which your country may claim to have played in the spread of these marvels, take an interest, I implore you, in these sacred dwellings which we call laboratories. Ask that their numbers be increased, that they may be spler lid. They are the temples of the future, temples of true wealth and well-being. It is in them that man grows great, grows strong, and grows good. There he learns to read the works of Nature, which are the works of progress and universal peace; while his own works are too often barbaric and destructive.”

So thought Marie Curie, remembering Pasteur, as she watched Pierre's completed Institute of Radium, in July, 1914. The building was ready, but Marie would have to wait four years, four years of war, before she could see work begin in the Institute of Radium and Pierre's dream come true.





Chapter XVI　War


August 1st, 1914.

“Dear Irène, dear Eve,

“Things seem to be going from bad to worse: we are expecting mobilization at any moment—I don't know if I shall be able to get away. Keep cool, be brave and calm. If there is no war, I shall come on Monday; if war comes, I shall remain here and send for you as soon as possible. Irène, you and I must try to make ourselves useful.”

August 2nd.

“Mobilization has begun and the Germans have entered France without a declaration of war. It will be difficult to get letters through for some time.

“Paris is calm and impressive in spite of the grief for the men going to the Front.”

August 6th.

“Brave little Belgium has not agreed to let them pass through without fighting. Everybody in France is hopeful that the struggle, though hard, will end in victory.

“Poland has been occupied by the Germans. What will remain of my country when they have finished with it? I have no news of my family.”

So wrote Marie to the children, who were on holiday in Brittany.

In Paris, Marie was extraordinarily alone. All her fellow-workers had gone to the war except one mechanic who had heart-disease and could not join up. Marie was ill and weak. But it did not enter her head to think of that or of the catastrophe that was happening to her work. She did did not follow the crowd of women who were offering to be nurses. As she had always done, she thought quickly and fiercely: where was there a gap to be filled with her work? The hospitals at the front, the hospitals behind the lines, were almost without X-ray appliances, were without that almost new and magic device by which a surgeon could see through men's flesh the shot or splinter of shell sitting fixed in the depths of a wound. X-rays had never been any business of Marie's; she had only been interested in them and had had a few lessons on them. That didn't matter. She would, with all speed, create X-ray stations. It took her only a few hours to make a list of all the X-ray apparatus available in Paris and get it distributed to the hospitals. Then she collected any scientists who could or would use it, and distributed them also. Paris was provided for.

But the wounded, pouring back, pouring back in their thousands, in ambulances from the front to field hospitals, what was to become of them? Marie did not hesitate. Time was everything. She turned for money to the U. F. de F. —the Union of the Women of France—and produced the first “Radiologic Car.” It was an ordinary motor-car with the electricity for the X-ray run off the engine. That travelling X-ray station went from hospital to hospital in the poor, shattered, beautiful Marne country, enabling all the wounded of the greatest battle of the war to be quickly examined, safely operated on, and many, many of them to be saved, who without it would have died. But before the battle of the Marne the Germans were fighting only a few miles from Paris. Would they get through? Would they take Paris? What ought Marie to do? Her children were alone in Brittany. Ought she to go to them? Ought she to go with the medical corps when they evacuated Paris? No. She was going to stay in Paris, whatever happened; because, as she put it, “Perhaps if I am on guard in the new buildings of the Pierre Curie laboratory the Germans will not dare to sack it; whereas if no one is there, for certain they will leave nothing.” Headstrong, unyielding Marie hated the mere thought of any flight. To be afraid was to help the enemy. Not for anything in the world would she give the enemy the satisfaction of entering a deserted Pierre Curie Institute! But if Marie wasn't leaving Paris, her one precious gramme of Radium had to go, and there was no one to escort it but herself.

She put on her black alpaca dust coat, packed her night things, and with a small, extraordinarily heavy packet of lead, took train for Bordeaux. Cramped on a wooden bench in the crowded train, with her Radium at her feet, she gazed out of the window at the fields under the burning early September sun and at the roads crowded with unending cars and carts fleeing always, fleeing to the west.

At Bordeaux, on the far western sea, Marie stood on the platform, hour after hour, with her little packet of lead still at her feet, the packet which was too heavy for a woman to carry and too valuable to be left alone. There were no porters and no taxis and no bedrooms. She smiled as she wondered if she would have to stand there all night. But she was rescued at last by a fellow-traveller, who helped to find her a bed and to house the Radium safely in a bank.

On the next morning she returned to Paris. In the evening she had been an unnoticed traveller in a mighty crowd of safety seekers, but in the morning she was stared at by a crowd who had collected to see the strange marvel of “the woman returning up there!” The woman returning up there was glad of the chance to tell them that there was no danger “up there,” that Paris would not fall, that its inhabitants would be in no danger. The woman returning up there, however, was hungry. She had had nothing to eat since the night before, and the troop train she was on merely crept towards Paris when it wasn't standing at ease in the fields. She was very glad of a bit of bread a friendly soldier gave her out of his haversack. And then when she reached lovely, threatened Paris, the joyful news came out to meet her that the enemy was held on the Marne.

Without a moment's rest, Marie rushed to the headquarters of the “National Help Society” to see what next she should do.

“Lie down, woman!” exclaimed its President, Appell, “Lie down and rest.'” She obeyed, but only while she discussed her future work. “With those great eyes of hers in her pale face,” said Appell, “she is nothing more than a flame.”

Then came the turn of the “little Curies.” Marie had two children in Brittany, but to the soldiers of France she was mother to the X-ray motor-cars that soon began to meet them everywhere as they were brought wounded from fighting. Marie fitted those cars out one by one at the laboratory and wrung from unwilling officials all they needed. She who had once been timid, bearded any lion in any den on behalf of her little Curies. She extracted “passes” from one, “pass- words” from another, visas from another— money from the rich, smart motor-cars from the kindly—“I'll return them,” said she, “if they are still returnable at the end of the war—I will indeed.”

A big Renault, more like a lorry than a car, she took for herself. Then began a life of outdoor adventure.

In her room in Paris the telephone bell rang. A big convoy of wounded needed an X-ray station. She went out to her car, painted grey for war with a big red cross; she carefully checked over her apparatus; then, while the soldier chauffeur filled up, she put on her dark coat, with red cross arm-band, and her soft, round, faded hat, and climbed into the seat beside the driver, with her old, yellow, cracked and sun-scorched leather bag. And then, at all the speed the slow old car could muster, she went, wind-whipped or rain-whipped, in the day or in the night, and without lights, into the war at places whose names are known for the fierceness of the fighting—Amiens, Ypres, Verdun.

Sentinels stopped them, enquired, passed them. The Renault found the hospital. Madame Curie chose her room and had the cases carried into it; then rapidly she put the apparatus together while others unrolled the electric cable that connected the car's dynamo with the apparatus. The chauffeur started up and Marie verified the current. Then she placed each thing in its right place, her protective gloves and glasses, her special pencils and lead wires for localising metal; then she darkened the room, with curtains if there were any or with bedclothes if there weren't. Meanwhile a second room had been got ready as a photographic dark room.

In half an hour from the time of her arrival, everything was ready, including the surgeon. Then began the long procession of the stretchers with the wounded; one after the other, one after the other, men in great pain, they came. Marie arranged her apparatus; the surgeon looked and saw among the shapes of bones or organs a dark fragment of this or that.

Sometimes an assistant wrote notes about the position of the metal at the surgeon's dictation for a later serious operation. Sometimes then and there the surgeon was able to operate and watch, while he worked, his pincers advancing into the wound and getting round some part of the bony skeleton to seize a piece of shrapnel.

The hours, and sometimes the days, passed. As long as there were wounded, Marie stayed in the dark room. Before she left the hospital, she had made her plans for installing a permanent X-ray theatre in it. In a few days, having moved heaven and earth to get it, she returned with the new apparatus and a new radiologist, whom she had conjured from nobody knew where.

In that way she personally installed 200 X-ray stations in hospitals, which, with her twenty cars treated more than a million wounded. That was great work for one woman.

But we mustn't fancy her, when she drove, always sitting beside a chauffeur in luxury on her front seat, protected from the weather. There were times when she had to do the driving and swing the mighty starting handle. She could congratulate herself when she hadn't more than two punctures, in a journey on those roads covered with splinters of every kind. She was often changing wheels with those same delicate, radium-burnt fingers in the terrible frost and wet that marked the war years. Sometimes she might be seen frowning a scientist's frown as she cleaned, most scientifically, an unfamiliar carburettor. Some-times she was doing porter's work, lifting heavy cases, when all men were in the fighting line.

Once she was angry! Her chauffeur, taking a curve too quickly, upset the car into a ditch and buried Marie under all the loose cases. Not that Marie mattered. It was the thought of what had happened to her delicate apparatus that made her furious. But she laughed aloud from under the cases when she heard the young man running round and round the car trying to catch a glimpse of her and asking, “Madame, are you dead? Madame, are you dead?”

Sometimes she forgot her breakfast or her dinner. Always she slept anywhere—in a bed if she could get one, under the stars if only they were available. It was natural to her, who had lived hard in her youth, to find herself a soldier of the Great War.

But that soldierly work was not all Marie's work. When She had time, she packed all the instruments in her old laboratory and had them taken to Pierre Curie's new laboratory. There she unpacked them and gradually fitted out the new home of science. She went to Bordeaux and brought back her gramme of Radium, and every week she “drew” its emanations from it, enclosed them in tubes and sent them for use to the hospitals.

With the tremendous increase of X-ray work, radiologists were needed. Marie taught and trained them in the new Radium Institute. Some of them were stupid and clumsy and hard to teach; but with infinite patience and sympathy she encouraged them and helped them, till they, too, could make a success of the delicate work. In that teaching she was helped by Irène, who was 17 by then. Irène had been studying radiology while still at the Sorbonne, and her mother had not thought her too young to work in the war hospitals.

In two years they trained 150 radiology nurses.

As if all that were not enough, Marie visited Belgian hospitals. Sometimes in hospitals where she was a stranger, fashionable ladies, who were nursing, mistook the shabby, poor-looking woman for a cleaner and treated her with scant courtesy. Marie didn't mind; she only felt more warmed and comforted by the charm of a certain nurse and a certain silent soldier who contentedly worked with her at d'Hoogstade: Elizabeth the Queen and Albert the King of the Belgians. She herself had lost all her cold distant manner and was just charming and infinitely gentle and encouraging with the wounded soldiers. She used to explain to the ignorant, scared peasants that her strange apparatus would not hurt them any more than a camera would. She was gay again.

She never spoke of herself, never said she was feeling tired, never felt frightened of shells falling round her. With all that work she went on daily, as if it were the most natural thing in the world.

But she longed for peace, longed for all that mad cruelty to come to an end! For her, with all the rest of the world, November 11th, 1918, was the happiest day that had been, when the cannon shot that marked the Armistice surprised her in her laboratory. Instantly she rushed out with her assistant, Mlle. Klein, to buy flags that the Institute might join in the glory. But there wasn't a flag in Paris! They had to make do with lengths of three colours which they sewed together. Then Marie took the old Renault and joined the wild throng in the streets, reckless of the fact that she had ten uninvited passengers on the wings and on the roof.

Who can guess the joy of the days that came after?

For Marie, it was not only her France that was free from the overwhelming terror, but her Poland also. Poland at last was free and in-dependent. She wrote to her brother:

“So we, ‘born in servitude and chained in our cradles,’ have seen the resurrection of our country.”





Chapter XVII　At Home


MARIE was at home again in a big old-fashioned flat on the Seine Quay side. The Seine has two islands in the heart of Paris: the Ile de la Cité, the ship-shaped isle, the oldest part of Paris, the old, with its sombre, beautiful and famous buildings; and the Ile St. Louis, old too and more lonely, where Marie lived on the Quai de Bethune. Two centuries before, the houses in the Rue de Bethune had been inhabited by dukes and gentlemen of the court. Marie's flat was a rambling place of corridors and many stairs. Her rooms were immense and lofty and empty. She had never learnt how to be rich or how to draw comfort around herself. Her few pieces of mahogany furniture stood about anyhow on the wide spaces of the slippery polished floor! She and Irène shivered and didn't notice it in the icy cold and bareness, but Eve spent her pocket money on attempts to make her own huge den cosy and elegant. One room was beautiful, Marie's study with its severe bookcases, its portrait of Pierre and its vase of flowers; and all the rooms had the beauty of light, for the windows were high and curtainless and they looked out on to the view that all the artists paint: the broad sunlit Seine with its busy little ships and colourful heavy barges and the towers of Notre Dame in the distance.

Marie had chosen the island for its loneliness and its quiet, but she seemed not to mind that, in fact, her house was full of noises. Eve's scales re-sounded on the piano hour by hour, a cat woke the echoes galloping down the corridors, the door bell clanged and the telephone rang through the emptiness, while the raucous syrens of the tugs came in from the river.

By eight o'clock every morning Marie's energetic, rapid footsteps, warned Irène and Eve that the busy day had begun. Any day for the next sixteen years was something like this: At eight-fortyfive three blasts of a motor horn told Marie that her little car was at the door. She hastily snatched her hat and coat and ran downstairs, because she would never think of keeping her chauffeur waiting more than three minutes. She began by having the handy man at the Institute to drive her, and when she took to a regular chauffeur, the poor man wept for grief that someone else should drive Marie. She drove across the Tournelle bridge and across the busy quays to the Latin quarter, where from the beginning of history, gay and rowdy students have lived in proverbial happiness and poverty and where, now-a-days, all the great learned institutes and buildings stand.

In the Rue Pierre Curie, Marie found herself at the entrance to the Institute of Radium. There was a crowd in the hall. Every morning there was a crowd in the hall and Marie called it the Soviet. Her students from this or that department always came to catch her before she went to her work, so that they should not trespass on her time, they said. They had a particular question to ask her or something to show her; or they hoped that Marie, overnight, had got out a problem for them. She often had. “Oh, Mr. So-and-So, your solution wouldn't work, but I have another for you…” Marie turned from one difficult piece of work to another, the crowd increased, each one bringing a difficult conundrum. Marie seemed not to mind what mental gymnastics they expected of her. Problems were often put to her in broken French or broken English, which added to the difficulty in hand. The Institute was quite a tower of Babel with all the languages of the East as well as all the tongues of the West. Marie tells a tale of her Chinese student who talked with her in English: he was so polite that even when she was wrong and he knew it, he had to agree with her and she had to use the very best of her brain to guess the silent contradiction which was at the back of his mind. She said that she was ashamed of her own manners in the presence of her Eastern students: “They are so much more civilized than we.”

The hall session often seemed unending and Marie would have to sit to it and, as there were no chairs, to sit on the stairs. It is a charming picture to think of her squatting on the lowest stair teaching her tall students at their feet. She was chief of the laboratory; she had read every book on anything to do with Radium in five languages; she was still inventing new techniques; she seemed to work by magic; her pupils could trust her guidance entirely. She was both bold and prudent.

One by one the students would go off to their particular experiments. Perhaps one who had something to show would take Marie with him; perhaps she would at last find herself free to go to her own laboratory and do her own work.

At mid-day she walked home to lunch but she still discussed Physics at the table with Irène. Eve sometimes felt out of it. Her mother and sister talked of BB prime and BB squared and as, in French, BB is pronounced bélé, which means baby, Eve was left wondering what a squared baby and a prime baby could possibly be.

But, in 1926, Irène married a brilliant young scientist called Joliot and Eve had the conversation to herself.

“Darling, you do the talking,” said Marie. “What are they doing in the world?” And Eve would talk to her about everything, for everything interested her, especially simple and childish things. She liked to hear how fast Eve drove, or what the baby said, when Irène's baby began to say things, or what people thought of the new Fascists.

“Ah!” said Marie, if by chance anyone praised a dictator, “I have lived under oppression. You haven't. You don't understand how happy you are to live in a free country.” And if anyone upheld the right of a Government to kill a rebel, she said: “You will never convince me that to guillotine Lavoisier served any purpose.”

After lunch the car would fetch her again and perhaps she would go to the flower market to buy her common garden flowers or wild ones if she could get them, for she never liked smart, greenhouse things. Or perhaps she had an appointment in the Luxembourg gardens with a very important personage, her baby granddaughter, Helène. She would sit and play at making sand-pies with her till it was time to go to the afternoon's session of the Academy of Medicine. There Marie was the only woman and her seat was next to her friend Dr. Roux, who had been Pasteur's most devoted disciple.

After the Academy, Marie went back to the laboratory and worked till dinner time on ordinary days; but sometimes till 2.0 in the morning if her experiments needed it.

Sometimes the seriousness of the place was disturbed by a tea party given in honour of some student who had become a doctor of science. Then scientific glasses became tea cups and glass rods served as spoons and the party closed with an address by Marie in which she congratulated the new doctor. The two happiest of those teas were those which celebrated Irène's doctorate and that of her husband, Frédéric Joliot. In 1934 those two made a great discovery, nothing less than artificial radio-activity. They bombarded aluminium and other substances with the rays of Radium and transformed them into new radioactive substances which had never been known before and which became sources from which Radium could be drawn. Scientists saw that a time might come when substances could be manufactured to do the work of Radium the rare. What a wonderful thing that would be, for across the garden, opposite the Radium Institute, was the building in which Radium was helping to cure cancer by the method known as Curietherapy. Radium was necessary and Radium was very rare.

Then there were the letters. Think of the letters of an important person! Fortunately a secretary opened the thousands of them— letters from thoughtless people asking for autographs, which they didn't get; letters asking foolish questions; letters from advertisers, from beggars. And in the great piles just a letter here and there that needed an answer.

Lastly, Marie had her lessons to give. Those were the things she hated. On a Monday and a Wednesday she was sick with nervousness from dawn till five o'clock, becaue she had to stand in the little amphitheatre and address some thirty students at once.

In those years she was threatened with blindness. The doctors told her that she must put up with being nearly blind for two or three years till she could have an operation. Probably they never dreamed what that meant to her. She wanted to work and she hated sympathy. Whatever happened, she did not want other people to know about her eyes. Eve had to book her glasses at the oculist's as those of Madame Carré. If she had a student's paper to correct, she made him bring it to her and then answer cleverly put questions on it, so that in that way she knew what he had written. She thought of every clever device to conceal her misfortune and the people who guessed pretended to notice nothing. That was to be truly kind. After her four operations she had to teach her eyes to work again. They would never work as they had worked, but her courage did not fail; she made them work.

But let us get back to Marie's day. We left her having late dinner with Eve. After dinner Eve had to go out and Marie, who was tired, lay on her sofa and watched her daughter dress. “Horrible heels, Eve! You will never make me believe that women were made for walking on stilts.”

“And what's this new fashion of bare backs? Bare in front is bearable, but these kilometres of bare back! Still the dress is pretty enough. Turn round and let me see how pretty you are.” Marie looked at her daughter with consternation: “I haven't any objection on principle to all this daubing. I know it has always been done. In ancient Egypt women invented worse things. I can say only one thing: I think it is hideous. You are cruel to your eyebrows and you daub your lips for no reason.”

“But, Mé, I really look better so.”

“Better! ! ! Listen, to console myself I shall come and kiss you in bed to-morrow morning before you have had time to put these horrors on your face.”

When Eve had gone, Marie, in her armchair, read a little poetry or a few pages of a favourite novel, but not for more than an hour. The floor was her place—the floor that gave her room to spread all her Physics papers around her and to work out her problems till two in the morning.

So Eve found her mother when she came in, a mother so absorbed in work that she did not notice her but went on counting, half aloud as she used to do at school and in Polish.





Chapter XVIII　Abroad


IT was May, 1920. The sun was hot. The chest-nuts in Paris were all in bloom, and Marie was, as usual, working. But an event was about to break in on her work; a most surprising event that she didn't expect in the least.

Marie never saw newspaper men, still less newspaper women. She hated being interviewed; she hated publicity. She had neat slips printed to say politely and firmly to strangers who wanted to meet her: “Madame Curie regrets…”

But people with Irish names who live in America sometimes have an odd little way of finding a right, irresistible word, and there was a certain Mrs. Meloney who had written to Marie: “My doctor father always used to say that it is quite impossible to exaggerate the littleness of human creatures. But for twenty years you have been great in my eyes, Madame, and I want to see you, only for a few minutes.” That was another way of saying: “Might a very little cat look at a queen?” and Marie, breaking all her own rules, said “Yes.”

So Mrs. Meloney waited on that May morning in Marie's tiny waiting-room at the Radium Institute, and this is how she described what happened:

“The door opened, and I saw come in a pale, timid woman with the saddest face I have ever seen. She had on a black cotton dress. Her splendid, patient, gentle face had the absent-minded look of people who study much. Suddenly, I felt that I was a mere intruder; I became even shyer than Madame Curie. I had been a professional reporter for more than twenty years and yet I couldn't manage to ask a single question of this defenceless woman in black cotton.”

It was Marie who set the reporter at ease by talking about America and Radium. She told her that America had fifty grammes of Radium, and she knew exactly how many grammes were in each town. “And how many has France?” asked Mrs. Meloney. “My laboratory possesses a little more than a gramme.”

“You have only a gramme of radium?”

“I? I haven't any. This gramme belongs to my laboratory.”

Then Mrs. Meloney began to speak of patents. She imagined, she said, that Marie must be drawing much money from those who used her methods of producing Raduim.

“Radium ought not to enrich anyone,” said Marie. “It is an element. It belongs to everybody.”

Mrs. Meloney must have felt then that the whole world ought to give Marie a present in return for what she had given the world. She said suddenly, “If you could choose out of the whole world the thing you would have, what would it be?”

Marie hesitated, “I need,” she said, “a gramme of radium to go on with my researches. But I can't buy it. Radium is too dear for me.”

It was then that Mrs. Meloney determined that America should give Marie Curie a gramme of Radium. She went home and tried to persuade ten rich women to give £3,000 each. But she could find only three. Then she turned from the few rich to the many poor. All the women of America should join together to give Marie the gift. In less than a year she wrote to Marie: “We have the money. Your Radium is yours.”

But America had grown excited over the collection. Soon all the girls and women had heard of the Madame Curie Radium Fund; everyone wanted to see Madame Curie. But Marie hated crowds. She did not want to go, but she had never before been offered so lovable a gift. Still she began to make excuses. She couldn't be separated from her daughters. That didn't worry hospitable America; they invited the girls, and told Marie that the gramme of Radium would be presented to her by the President himself.

So Marie, Irène and Eve packed all their clothes into one single trunk and set sail in the Olympic's most luxurious cabin, for America willed it so. France gave them a great send-off with a gala performance at the Opera, in which the greatest actors, Sarah Bernhardt, and the famous Guitrys, took part. Only the Atlantic refused to join in honouring Science; the ocean remained morose, dark and uncivilised, and encouraged Marie to dream with longing of the blue sunlit seas at home.

As the Olympic docked, Mrs. Meloney, who had travelled with her, brought Marie from her cabin to meet a real American welcome, and only those who have experienced it can imagine the warm-hearted sincerity of it. The crowd had been waiting five hours to greet her whom they named, “The benefactor of the human race.” It was summer; the skies were blue above the splendid white skyscrapers. The quay was colourful with the flags of Poland, France, and America. Students, girl-guides, three hundred women representing the Polish women of America, waved red and white roses before her. She sat, rather like a child trying to be good, in an armchair on the upper deck, while Mrs. Meloney took away her hat and her handbag and posed her for the photographers. “Your head to the right, please, Madame Curie.” “A little more this way please... !”

America went mad with welcome. The Americans were determined that the world should see through their eyes that a scientist is perhaps the greatest human-being. Their hearts were captured by Marie's love for pure science, by her scorn of profit, and by her conviction that to serve is the true purpose for which men live.

Nothing that they could invent to honour her was neglected. They wanted to welcome her everywhere and forgot the long distances of their great country. They offered her banquets where the guests were five hundred, and forgot the long hours. They offered her titles of honour by the bagful, and forgot that in her own country she refused them all. They asked her to university ceremonies and were surprised that she had no cap and gown. They offered her flowers grown especially for her, and forgot that she preferred them wild. Love is often like that; but Marie, though tired, understood. The only thing she could not tolerate was the magnificent university gown they made for her, for to expect her to wear silk was just a little too much, because silk irritated her fingers that Radium itself had injured.

Marie's first visits were to the women's colleges. Everywhere she went, girls in white made hedges to the roads or ran in immense clusters across fields to greet her carriage. And above the white masses were always the coloured streamers of the flags. At an immense gathering in New York the university women passed in long file before her, bowing and presenting alternately the Lily of France and the Rose of America. In another gathering of ambassadors and the great of many Lands, at which she was given the “Freedom of New York”, the most famous person after herself was Paderewski, whom long ago, when he was a struggling pianist, she had encouraged with her clapping.

Then came the great event: the presentation of the gramme of Radium.

The White House at Washington was prepared for the fête. The President of the United States and all the great people of America were there to meet Marie, but Radium itself was absent. It was too dangerous and too precious to sit about on tables and be handled by a president. It stayed safely in the factory and was present only by proxy. On a table in the east room during the ceremony stood a Radium casket containing tubes of imitation Radium.

At four o'clock the double doors were thrown open and the procession entered, Marie on the arm of President Harding.

In his address, the President reminded the guests that Marie was not only a great scientist, but a devoted wife and mother. She had done the daily work of a man and all her womanly duties in addition.

At the end of his speech, he gave her a rolled parchment, the deed of gift, and hung the tiny gold key of the real casket round her neck. Then, in the blue room, Marie sat while all the guests passed in procession before her and shook hands with Irène and Eve, because she herself was too tired.

So Marie possessed a gramme of Radium! By no means. On the evening before the ceremony, Mrs. Meloney had shown her the deed of gift and she had insisted, then and there, though it was late at night, that a lawyer should be sent for to give the gramme legally to her laboratory. When Mrs. Meloney suggested that the week after would do, Marie exclaimed: “I might die tonight!” From that evening her gramme was just something to work with which belonged to the laboratory.

There were other visits to make. America, full of penitence at having tired its guest, tried to spare her fatigue in every possible way. Sometimes they arranged for her to arrive at the station before the one at which she was expected, and when the excited people found out what had been done, there was a stream of cars along the road to meet the traveller. Sometimes Marie had to get out of the train on the wrong side, jump down to the rails and walk across them, which could not have been really restful. Sometimes Irène and Eve were accepted as their mother's understudies, and nobody smiled when staid professors spoke to sixteen-year-old Eve of her “magnificent discoveries” and “her lifetime of labour.”

But Marie was present herself when the Poles fêted her in Chicago. To them she was a symbol of their distant birthplace and her triumph was Poland's. Men and women, their faces wet with tears of joy, tried to kiss her feet or the hem of her dress.

On the Olympic, on which she sailed home at the end of June, was the Radium itself, locked in behind the complicated locks of the ship's safe. But in her letters, it was not of Radium she wrote, but of a little touch of gladness in her heart because she had been able to win just a little more American friendliness for France and Poland.

America's joy in her had taught Marie how much she meant to the great world. She realised that her mere name, her mere presence, could help the things she cared for and loved. So she began to travel more and face ceremonies and congresses. She became known the world over. She visited South America, Spain, England and Czechoslovakia. Even in China, though she did not go there, there was a portrait of her in a temple of Confucius side by side with the Buddhas and the Emperors of the Celestial Empire.

In all her travels she enjoyed the odd things she saw. She liked the fish that jump out of the water and fly through the air and, at the

Equator, it amused her that she lost her shadow, and she loved the wild flowers, new and old, that met her in strange places.

But apart from the things that she merely looked at and loved, there were the other loved things that she journeyed to fight for. Like everyone else who had served mankind, she hated war. She had been willing in war to do a soldier's work in defence of her country; but in peace, she was eager to serve in preventing future wars. She refused to take time from research to belong to Soceities, but she made one exception: she allowed herself to be nominated by the Council of the League of Nations as a member of the society of men and women who decided to use their brains to find ways of getting different nations to work together. That Society was called “The International Committee on Intellectual Co-operation.” Marie did not belong to it merely to talk. She set to work to do definite things. One was to get scientific people of all nations to use the same scientific terms and to make complete lists of all the scientific books and discoveries all the world over, so that every student could know what work had already been done.

Next, Marie wanted a scheme to help any scientific genius who might, in any nation, be too poor to develop its gifts. It is horrible waste, she thought, to throw away a genius. She gave all her strength to help to create a world in which freedom, peace and science were ever more and more. Now that the Radium Institute in Paris was working, Marie determined to build a Radium Institute in Warsaw. Her sister Bronia, who was in Poland, launched the appeal. All Poland was soon covered with placards; all the post-offices sold stamps with Marie's picture; postcards invited everyone to “buy a brick to build the Marie-Sklovodska-Curie Institute,” and, on them in Marie's writing, were the words: “My most ardent desire is the creation of a Radium Institute in Warsaw.”

1925, Marie was able to go to Warsaw for the foundation of the Institute. The President of the Republic laid the first brick, Marie the second. Laughingly, he asked her if she remembered the travelling pillow she had lent him when he was poor. She replied: “Yes, and you forgot to return it.” She remembered, too, that the famous actor who complimented her from the stage was none other than Monsieur Kotarbinski, for whom Manya had once plaited a crown of wild flowers.

But a Radium Institute was a queer place without Radium. Mrs. Meloney had again to persuade the United States to give Marie another gramme, and again Marie went to New York. On that occasion it was to thank the Americans in the name of Poland. She stayed at the White House and found it very amusing to see it full of elephants, large elephants, small elephants, minute elephants, white elephants. As a parting gift she was given two elephants, a little ivory one and an almost invisible one. Elephants were the badge of the governing party. With her two and the Radium, she returned to Warsaw to see the Institute begin its work of curing the sick.

As she had done when she was a little girl, she wandered by the great Vistula and wrote about it:

“The river winds, broad and lazy, gray near at hand and blue as heaven in the distance. Adorable sandbanks, sparkling in the sun, show here and there and mark the capricious course of the stream. At the edge of these banks, strips of more brilliant light show where the waters grow deep. I simply have to wander by these light-filled magnificent shores…There is a song which says: ‘In this Polish water there is such charm that those who love it once, love it for ever.’ To me that is true. This great river has a deep inexplicable fascination.”





Chapter XIX　Holiday


THERE was a place in Brittany. Pink granite cliffs and rocks ran out into a blue, clear sea that was always calm, because a reef of a thousand islands kept out the Atlantic tumult of the waves. There, in a dip among the rocks was Larcouëst, a group of fishermen's cottages, not even a village, a mere hamlet, where the Breton fishwives went out and in with their wide, white linen bonnets protecting their faces from the wind.

High up on the moor, in the clear path of all the winds and looking like a lighthouse, was Marie's little holiday home, a wisp of a little poor cottage with a glorious view. Marie was a nobody in Larcouëst. The king of the country was a little old hunchback man with smiling eyes behind spectacles, and the palace where he lived was a long, low cottage covered from ground to roof with virginiacreeper, wild red fuchsia, and travellers' joy. It stood in an orchard and was called Taschen-Vihan, which in Breton means “the little orchard field.” Its door was always open, except when the east wind blew, and all the old king's subjects—Marie and Irène and Eve and Frédéric Joliot and children and babies and scientists and writers—in fact all the people who loved him and everybody loved him, visited him all day long and never gave a thought to the fact that he was one of the most learned historians who ever lived, none other than Charles Seignobos whom everybody knows. He had discovered Larcouëst, and every summer the wisest, most learned people of Paris went to make holiday there.

Every morning, Marie in a washed-out linen hat, an old skirt, sandals and the black reefer jacket that all Larcouëstians wore, fishermen and ladies alike, used to take the steep path that led hither and thither down from her moor and ended among the flaming flowers of Taschen's garden.

“Good-morning, Madame Curie,” called Seignobos. “Good-morningt!” echoed the fifteen or so others who were lying about in the grass or the flowers, looking, in their queer rigout, like a company of gypsies.

Marie slung her rucksack on the ground and sat beside it. Larcouëst, like everywhere else, had its severe social distinctions; but they were of a different kind from those in most villages. In Larcouëst people of the lowest rank were called Philistines. They were simply strangers who didn't belong to Larcouëst. Next above them came the people whom you could just know, the Elephants. They were friends, but unfortunate landlubbers, people who were not as comfortable in and on the sea as they were on the land. They were to be pitied, but they could be improved. Above them came the honourable of the place, the Sailors, and then in distant, worship-able dignity, were the Crocodiles, those to whom all the arts of the sea were known. Not only could they swim, they could “crawl” and manage sails and oars among the stiffest currents. Marie had never been a Philistine and had little hope of ever being a crocodile. She had begun as an elephant and had risen to be a sailor.

At a word from Seignobos, the sailors of the day loosed from the fleet of two sailing boats and six rowing boats which were moored at the quay, the pinnace and the dinghy, and sculled them to the rock landing-stage.

“Aboard! aboard!” ordered Seignobos. “I'll row stroke, Madame Curie will row bow; Perrin and Borel to the oars, and Francis, you steer.”

The crews were all professors. The white and green boat went round in a circle, for one pulled too hard. The steersman called his oarsmen to attention: “Bow is not following stroke.” Marie blushed and timed her stroke. The sea rippled under the sun, and the mariners sang:

Three little boys sail for the isles!

Who sail with a boat-load of joys

For the isles, are three little boys. …

At the end of the third song, it was time to change the oars because stronger rowers were needed to take the boats through the current to Roch Vras, the violet-coloured desert island where the Larcouëstians bathed. The men took as their dressing-room the shore which they shared with the brown gulls; the women had a rock chamber carpeted with soft green grass.

Marie was first into the deep transparent water. She was a good swimmer even if she could not do the crawl. In the water she was young again, her gray hairs were hidden under her cap, and no-one could see her wrinkles. She was slender and graceful and quick and deliciously proud of her skill. “Aren't I much better than Borel?” she called to Irène, and Irène, who was no flatterer, could truthfully answer: “Oh much better, Mé. There is no comparison.”

After the bath, Marie sunbathed and ate a crisp little loaf. “It's a good life,” she would murmur, or, “Isn't it lovely?” No-one, not even Marie Curie, was allowed to say anything more about the beauty of Larcouëst. It was one of the things that were not done. Larcouëst was the loveliest place in the world. Everybody knew it and so it was not necessary to say so.

At mid-day the boats went home to the songs of the crews. Marie, bare-foot and bare-legged, her sandals in her hand, picked up her skirts and waded to the shore through the black mud where the white gulls sat in crowds.

The company lunched in their own homes, but most of them returned to Taschen at two to sail in the yacht Wild Rose. The yachts and the boats all belonged to Seignobos. Everything belonged to him, but he was one of those people who liked their possessions to be the property of all their friends. Marie did not sail; she found sitting in a sailing yacht too slow an occupation. Instead, she sat at home in her lighthouse correcting science papers; or she took her spade, her fork and her secateurs and gardened. Her reeds and brambles drew her blood; her unexpected rocks twisted her ankle, or she crushed her own fingers with her hammer; but she paid no attention to small matters. At six she bathed again and went to Taschen to keep the oldest old lady company and watch for the return of the Wild Rose. Its sails, golden in the setting sun, appeared just before dinner, and its wild happy crew came back to Taschen, the girls' hair decorated with the carnations Seignobos gave them each day from his garden.

After dinner everyone went back to Taschen through the everopen door. Perhaps they played games, simple games like word-making or charades. Sometimes there was a ball. An accordion played the music for old-fashioned dances, and everybody danced together—scientists and peasants, servants and masters.

Sometimes on fine nights, Marie and Irène and Eve went armin-arm for walks in the dark along mysterious, winding paths by the wine-dark sea. Did some sudden wind, bringing the booming of great breakers from beyond the reefs, remind Marie that, like the sea, her Radium was radiant yet dangerous? Larcouëst is near to Paimpol. The Larcouëstians played all day with a sunfit sea; but the men of Paimpol were the men of the Iceland fisheries who knew best the dark and bitter strangeness of the sea.

Every year in her holidays Marie played with the glittering, innocent sea. In her worktime, she played with Radium. She breathed in its rays. It burnt her hands, for she disdained the leaden shields which she made other people wear. It did strange, mysterious things with her blood. It puzzled the greatest doctors of France.

It was not till one summer day, July the 4th, 1934, when Marie Curie lay dead of an unknown illness at Sancellemoz in the mountains, that the doctors guessed that she had died from too great friendliness with her great discovery, Radium.
