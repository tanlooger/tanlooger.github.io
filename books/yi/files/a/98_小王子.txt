译者写给小读者的话


写这个童话故事的是上个世纪一个法国人，他的中文名字请见本书的封面。如果小读者要知道他的原文名，那就是：Saint-Exupéry。

这个人有那么一点点特别，他从四五岁起，就梦想将来能翱翔于蓝天之上，这在上个世纪初航空飞行技术还很不发达的时代，要算是一个很“新潮”的理想。他十二岁时，就被一个著名的飞行员带着第一次飞上了天空，这事在当时也很不简单。经过长期的努力，他终于在二十一岁的时候，获得了飞机驾驶员的资格证书，以后，就一直在空军、邮政航空队以及航空公司任职。第二次世界大战中，他在一次值勤任务时失踪，时年四十四岁。

他也是一个很有文学成就的作家，写了好些小说、散文作品，这些作品基本上都与他的航空生涯有关。《小王子》是他唯一的一篇童话，内容也多少与航空有关。看来，很可能也是从他自己的职务生涯中获得灵感后写成的。他这些作品都很出色，早已在世界各国流传，拥有千千万万读者，凡稍有文学知识的人，都知道法国二十世纪文学中有这么一位专写航空题材的大作家。

《小王子》是一个很美的童话故事。主人公，一个幼小的外星人，飞离了自己那颗小小的星球，在太空中转了一大圈，拜访了一些其他的星球，见识了不少事情与人物，后来到地球上，与地球人“我”建立了永久不渝的友谊。一年之后，他告别了朋友，又回自己的星球去了。这样一个星际旅行的童话，出现于二十世纪三十年代末期，可以说是体现了人类对宇宙航行的初期向往。不过，作者毕竟是一位航空工程师，他深知航空飞行的艰难，他笔下的小王子可不像孙悟空那样会腾云驾雾，一个跟头就是十万八千里，他要从地球上回自己的星球上去，就难得很哟，几乎牺牲了自己的小命。在这里，作者提醒了读者，人类的宇航道路实在还很漫长很漫长！

这个童话故事并没有写什么惊天动地的大事，千奇百怪的东西，主要倒是写外星人小王子与地球人“我”的交往与友谊，他们的相遇相处，就像一个小孩与邻家叔叔、伯伯在一起时那样，平淡而感人。特别是他们相互鼓励，相互帮助，经过长途跋涉，终于在沙漠里找到水井，成为了生死之交。他们最后分手告别的场面是很悲壮很动人的。我译的时候，就有些难过。小读者看了，也许还会落泪。但使人欣慰的是，小王子回到自己的星球上后，他们相距千万里太空，却仍互相思念，互相关心，遥遥相望，心心相印。于是，浩瀚的太空里，无垠的宇宙中，也都充满了他们之间的感应电波，他们的友谊气息。这是多么美好、多么和谐的关系！是作者在人类的宇航理想之外所表现的另一种理想，即人类的人文理想。

《小王子》中的宇航理想与人文理想，都是人类最美好的理想，在人类驾驭自然的能力还很有限的今天，在地球上仍存在着矛盾、冲突、对立、仇视与残害的时代，这两种理想，都将感召与鼓舞人类奔向更为美好的将来，即便这一路途仍很遥远。

故事中的小王子非常可爱，他天真、善良、单纯、敏感，富有同情心，善解人意……成年读者看了，一定会觉得他就像自己的孩子，一副叫人怜爱的模样；小读者看了，一定会觉得他就像自己的小弟弟，亲切而招人喜爱。这个童话故事既是写给小孩看的，也是写给成年人看的；既有丰富有趣的想象，也有深刻的哲理，可以说是老少皆宜。这并不矛盾。因为成年人十分需要有童心与童趣，这样可以年轻些，纯净些，而小孩毕竟将长大为成年人，他不能不懂得成年人世界里的事情与道理。





献给雷昂·维尔特


我请求小读者们原谅我把这本书献给了一个成年人。我有一个正当的理由，该得到大家的谅解，因为这人是我在世界上最要好的朋友。我还有另一个理由，那就是这人善解一切，甚至善解专为儿童写的书。我的第三个理由则是，这人就住在法国，过着饥寒交迫的生活，需要得到安慰。如果这几条理由还不充足的话，那我就愿意把这本书献给已经长大成人的这个孩子。所有的成年人本来都是儿童，可惜很少有成年人还记得这一点。因此，我不妨把我的题词改为：

当他还是一个小男孩的时候





一


我六岁的时候，有一次在一本描写原始森林，名为《百兽生猛史》的书里，看见过一幅令人惊叹的插图。图上画的是一条蟒蛇在吞噬一头野兽，下图是我对那幅插图的临摹。



书里是这样讲的：“蟒蛇吃掉其猎物时，总是囫囵吞入，无须咬嚼。吞下之后，它们就动弹不了，然后一睡就是六个月，躺在那里静静地消化食物。”

看过后，我对原始森林里百兽争斗的情景思索了好久，接着，就用一支彩色笔，画出我生平的第一张图画，即我的“绘画作品第一号”。下图便是：



我把自己这幅得意之作拿给成年人看，还问他们看了害不害怕。

他们回答我说：“为什么要怕一顶帽子呢？”

我画的当然不是一顶帽子，而是一条刚吞下一头大象的蟒蛇。为了使那些成年人明白，我又画出蟒蛇一侧的剖面图。成年人总需要别人对他们多加解释。以下就是我的“绘画作品第二号”：



到头来，大人们都劝告我，不要再去画蟒蛇整体图、蟒蛇剖面图了，还是好好去学地理、历史、算术和语法吧。就这样，在六岁的时候，我就不得不放弃了当画家的远大理想。我的第一号与第二号绘画作品的失败，特别使我灰心丧气。大人们从来都不自己把事情弄明白，而老要我们小孩解释个没完没了，这真是特别累人的事。

于是，我选择了另一种职业，学会了驾飞机。世界各地我都飞过。的确，地理知识对我有很大的帮助，它使我一眼就能识别中国与美国亚利桑那州的不同。万一夜间迷航，这可大有用处。

在实际生活中，我与很多严肃认真的人，有过很多很多的接触。我在成年人之中，生活了很多年，对他们有近距离的观察。对他们的了解，并没有怎么改变我对他们的上述看法。

每当我遇上一个我觉得还算聪明的成年人的时候，我就拿出我一直保存着的那幅绘画作品第一号，做个测试，看对方是否理解那幅画。但是，我每次都得到同样的回答：“这是一顶帽子。”于是，我跟他就不谈蟒蛇了，也不谈原始森林，更不谈星星月亮。我就把自己降到他那个水平，跟他谈桥牌，谈高尔夫球，谈政局，谈领带。在这种情况下，对方总感到很高兴能结识我这么一个通情达理的朋友。





二


我就这么孤独地活着，没有遇到过一位我能和他推心置腹交谈的成年人。直到六年前，我的飞机在撒哈拉沙漠发生故障。发动机里不知什么零件坏了。飞机上既没有机械师，也没有乘客。我只得单枪匹马，自己试着进行修理。对我来说，这是一个生死存亡的大考验。机上携带的饮用水很有限，只能维持八天。

第一天夜晚，我睡在荒无人烟的沙漠里。我比一个漂浮在海面上的遇难者更为孤立无援。可是在太阳升起的时候，有一个奇特而轻微的声音把我弄醒了，请你们设想一下，当时我是感到多么惊奇。那声音对我说：

“请你……请你给我画一只绵羊吧！”

“噢！”

“请给我画一只绵羊。”

我霍地一下跳了起来，就像被雷击中了似的。我使劲揉揉眼睛，仔细察看四周。我看见了一个非常奇特的小男孩，他正认真地瞧着我。请看，下面就是我后来给他画得最好的一幅肖像。当然，我画的远不如他本人那么生动。这可不是我的过错。早在我六岁时，那些大人使我断送了当画家的前程，所以，除了蟒蛇整体图与蟒蛇剖面图以外，我就不会画任何别的东西了。



我非常惊奇，把眼睛睁得大大的，盯着这显形的神童。请你们不要忘记，那时我正远离人间世界十万八千里，而我眼前这个小人儿，看来并不像是迷路的，他不疲惫，不饥，不渴，也不认生害怕。他丝毫不像一个在荒凉可怕的沙漠中迷了路的小孩。当我定下神来能够说话了，就对他说：

“怎么回事……你在这儿干什么呀？”

他用轻柔的声音，郑重其事地仍重复他那个要求：

“请你……给我画一只绵羊。”

奥秘神奇的东西一旦使得你震惊，你就不敢违抗，尽管当时我觉得自己身陷渺无人迹的地方且有生命危险，遇上此事甚为荒唐可笑，我还是从自己衣袋里拿出一张纸和一支钢笔。不过，我想起了我过去专攻的课程是地理、历史、数学和语文，而不是绘画，就带点遗憾的心情对那小人儿说，我是不会画图画的。他回答说：

“这不碍事。请你只画一只绵羊。”

因为我从来没有画过绵羊，就把我仅仅会画的那两幅画中的一幅，重新画了出来交给他，也就是那幅蟒蛇整体图。他的答复使我特别惊讶，他说：

“不！不！我不要一头在蟒蛇肚子里的大象。一条蟒蛇太可怕，一头大象太庞大太拥挤。我家里非常狭小。我需要的是一只绵羊。给我画一只绵羊吧。”

我只好给他画了一只。



他仔细认真地端详之后，说：

“不行，这只羊已经病病歪歪的啦，再给我画一只！”我又画了一只。

我的这位小朋友和善地笑了，他宽宏大量地说：

“你瞧……你画的不是一只绵羊，而是一只公羊，它有角……”



于是，我又重新画了一只。

但是，又遭到了他的否定，就像上两只一样。

“这一只羊太老了。我要一只能活得很久很久的绵羊。”



一让再让，我实在是不耐烦了，因为我急于去修理飞机发动机。于是，我随便涂抹了一幅，扔给了他：

“画上是一只箱子，你要的那只绵羊就在箱子里。”



可是，我的这位小小裁判官却笑逐颜开了，这真使我感到意外，他对我说：

“这正是我想要的！你说说，这只绵羊要吃很多很多草吗？”

“你问这干什么？”

“因为我家里很狭小……”

“箱子里的草肯定够它吃，我给你画的是一只特小的绵羊。”

他低下头去看看那张图画，说：

“也不是那么小呀……瞧！它在箱子里睡着了……”

我就是这么认识小王子的。





三


我费了好长的时间才搞清楚小王子来自什么地方。他似乎从不听我的问话，倒是不断地向我提出种种问题。正是从他时不时偶然的只言片语中，我得知了有关他的一切。当他第一次见到我的飞机（这里我不想把我的飞机画出来，对我来说，画飞机实在是太难了）的时候，就曾问过我：

“这是什么东西呀？”

“这不是一件东西。这是一架飞机，是我的飞机，它会飞。”

我还得意扬扬地告诉他我是驾飞机来的。他一听，就惊叹地说：



“怎么？你是从天上掉下来的？”

“是的。”我谦虚地承认。

“啊，这可真是有趣呀……”

小王子乐得大笑起来，这使得我很恼火，我期望别人对我飞机出事的遭遇抱同情的态度。接着他又补充了一句：

“这么说，你也是从天上来的啰！你从哪颗星球来的？”

我立刻感到，这是刺探他是如何出现的秘密的好机会，可以打听打听他是怎么来到我眼前的。于是，我猛然发问：

“你是从别的星球上来的吧？”

但他并不回答我的问题，轻轻地晃动着脑袋，望着我的飞机说：

“说真的，光靠这东西，你不可能是从很远很远的地方来的……”

接着，他沉浸在自己的幻想之中，足有好一阵子。然后，他从口袋里掏出我给他画的那只绵羊，观赏起他的这个宝贝来了。

你们可以想象出，他问话中关于“其他星球”模棱两可的含义，是多么使我感到惊讶，因此，我使劲要问个明白：

“我的小宝贝，你是从什么地方来的？你的家在哪儿？你要把我的绵羊带到什么地方去？”

他静静地沉思了一小会儿之后，答道：

“多好呀，你给我的那只箱子，夜晚就可以给绵羊当房子住。”

“当然啦。你要是乖乖的话，我再给你画一根绳子，好让你白天把绵羊拴住。再给你画一根木桩。”

我这个建议使得小王子很不高兴。

“把绵羊拴住？多么荒唐的想法！”

“可你要是不拴住它，它会到处乱跑的，它会走丢的呀……”

我的小朋友又咯咯笑了起来。

“但是，你想它往哪里跑呢？”

“随便哪里，一直往前跑……”

小王子一本正经地指出：

“没有关系，我那个地方实在是小得很！”

他似乎略带忧伤地又说了一句：

“它一直往前跑，也跑不了多远……”





四


我就这么了解到第二个十分重要的真相，那便是他的那个星球只比一座房子稍微大一点。



这并不使我过分吃惊。我知道，地球、木星、火星、金星都是我们地球人给它们命名的，除此之外，还有千万颗别的星球实在太小，用望远镜都很难观测到。一旦天文学家发现了其中的某一颗，就会给它编个号码当做它的名字，比方说，把它称为“3251号小行星”。

我有充分的理由坚信，小王子那颗星球就是“B612号小行星”，这个星星只在1909年被一位土耳其天文学家从望远镜里观察到一次。

于是，他在国际天文学的一次会上，郑重其事地证实了他的这一发现。

然而，因为他穿的土耳其服装与众不同，在场的没有人相信他说的话。成年人总是这副样子。



幸亏，土耳其一个独裁者下令臣民改穿欧式服装，不执行者以死罪论处。这才使得“B612号小行星”闻名遐迩。1920年那一次会上，那位土耳其天文学家，穿着一身漂亮时髦的西服，再次论证了他的发现。这一回，全体与会者都一致同意他的创见。



我之所以向你们小读者讲了关于“B612号小行星”的以上细节，并指出其编号，完全是为了成年人。成年人喜欢数目字。当你跟他们说起一位新朋友的时候，他们从来不问你最本质的特征。比方说，他们从来不问：“他的嗓音怎么样？他爱玩什么游戏？他是不是爱搜集蝴蝶标本？”他们只问你：“他多少岁数？他有几个兄弟？他的父亲挣多少钱？”问清楚这些问题，他们就以为了解这个人了。你如果对成年人说：“我看见了一幢漂亮的红砖小房子，窗上爬满了天竺葵，屋顶上停憩着鸽子……”他们是想象不出这房子是什么模样的。但是，如果对他们说：“我看见了一幢值十万法郎的房子。”他们就会高声嚷嚷：“那是多么漂亮啊！”

因此，如果你对成年人说：“的的确确有过一位小王子，他很招人喜欢，他老咯咯发笑，他还向人要过一只绵羊。既然要过一只绵羊，那就证明这个小王子确有其人。”他们听了会耸耸肩膀，把你当做一个小孩看待！但是，如果你对成年人说：“小王子来自另一个星球，就是‘B612号小行星’。”那他们就信服了，就不会没完没了用他们那些问题来烦你了。成年人总是这副样子。不能强求他们变成另一个样子。小孩应当对大人尽量宽容一些。

当然啦，我们这些真正理解生活的人，才不会去在乎数目字哩！我多愿意像讲神话故事那样去讲小王子的故事，多愿意这么来讲：

“从前，有一个小王子，他住的那颗星球比他本人大不了多少，他需要找一个朋友……”对于那些理解生活的人来说，这种讲法就显得真实自然得多。

因为我不喜欢人家并不严肃认真地来读我写的书。我讲述以上这些回忆时，是颇感忧伤的。我那位小朋友和他的绵羊一道离去已经有六个年头了。我试着在这里描述他，是为了不忘记他。忘记一个朋友是很可悲的事。很多很多人从来就没有一个朋友。何况我也可能变得和那些成年人一模一样，只对数目字感兴趣。正是为了不忘却他，我才买了一盒水彩与几支铅笔。到了我现在这个岁数，要重新拾起绘画是很难很难的，特别是我只在小小六岁的时候画过一条蟒蛇的整体图与剖面图，此外就从没有试过画点别的什么！当然啰，我会尽最大的努力画好我那位小朋友。但能否做得到，我是没有多大把握的。这一幅画得还可以，另一幅画得就不像了。在画他的身材高矮时，我也常常出错。这一幅把他画得太高大，那一幅又画得太矮小。至于他衣服的颜色，我常犹豫不决。于是，我就这么试试，那么试试，勉勉强强，凑凑合合。最后，在某些重要的细节上，我也常常弄错。对此，大家应该原谅我。我那位小朋友从来不给我解释这解释那，他也许以为，我和他同源同种，非常相像。但是，我跟他其实不同，我又不能透视万物，如像透过箱子看到里面那只绵羊。也许，我有点像那些成年人了。我一定是老啰。





五


每天，我都了解到有关他那颗星球上的一些事，关于他是怎么起程出发的，他在太空里是怎么长途旅行的，等等。这些我都是在他时不时进行沉思时，不动声色地了解到的。第三天，正是在这种情况下，我了解到关于猴面包树的故事。

这回，还得归功于那只绵羊，因为，小王子突然向我发问，好像是在沉思时产生了一个严重的疑惑：

“绵羊都爱啃灌木丛，这是真的吗？”

“的确，是真的。”

“哦！那我就高兴啦！”

我不明白，为什么绵羊吃不吃灌木丛，这么事关重大。我还没有想明白，小王子又追问：

“那么，绵羊啃不啃猴面包树呢？”

我提请小王子注意，猴面包树并不是什么低矮的灌木丛，而是高高大大的树，足有教堂那么高，要是他拥有一群大象的话，这群大象摞在一起，还不及一棵猴面包树高呢。

一提到象群，可把小王子逗得笑了起来：

“还得把那些大象一头一头摞起来呀……”



不过，他很聪明，马上就注意到了：

“猴面包树在长成大树之前，起初也是小小的树苗呀。”

“的确是这么回事！可你为什么要让你的绵羊去啃那些猴面包树的小苗呢？”

“嘿，咱们瞧吧！”他这么回答我，似乎这件事是再明白不过的。但是，对我来说，要弄明白是怎么回事，可让我绞尽了脑汁。

实际情况是这样的，在小王子的那颗星球上，也像所有别的星球一样，长有良草与莠草。因此，良草自然产良草子，莠草产莠草子。可是，草子是良是莠，起初是看不见的。它们在地下沉睡，不露出自己的本性。直到有一天，其中的一粒一时兴起，苏醒了过来，伸了个懒腰，朝着太阳羞怯怯地先长出一片嫩嫩的幼芽，它娇美可爱，不露声色。如果这是小红萝卜或玫瑰的幼芽，那就可以任它自由生长。但如果是一株有害植物的幼芽，一旦识别了它，那就必须立即拔掉。而在小王子的那个星球上，就有那么一种邪恶的种子……



那就是猴面包树子。他那个星球的土壤，饱受了这种树的破坏。如果对一棵猴面包树下手晚了的话，那就永远休想把它清除干净。它会不断生长，用自己的根须使劲在星球里穿刺，直到塞满星球。如果这颗星球太小，而猴面包树又铺天盖地，整个星球就会被它们撑破撑裂。

“在我家里，我必须遵守严格的作息制度，”小王子后来这么告诉我，“每天一清早，梳洗完毕之后，我就该仔细认真地清扫星球。猴面包树与玫瑰树刚发芽的时候，非常相似。我一旦把它们区别出来，就必须立即把猴面包树幼苗拔掉，这件工作十分枯燥，但做起来也很容易。”

有一天，他劝我花些工夫画出一幅漂亮的图画，好让地球上的孩子明白以上的道理。他对我这样说：“假如将来有一天他们旅行的话，明白了这种情况，对他们是有用处的。有的时候，把自己的工作拖拉一下并无关紧要，但如果在对付猴面包树上拖延了时间，那就会酿成灾难。我就知道这么一个事例：有一个星球，那上面住了一个懒汉，他对三棵小树掉以轻心，结果出了大祸……”

于是，我按照小王子所作的描述，画出那颗出了大祸的星球。本来，我很不愿意板着道学家的面孔进行说教的，但是，地球人对猴面包树所能造成的危害，实在知之甚少，而且，这种树在一颗小行星上所引起的灾难是那么严重，那么触目惊心。因此，我这一次破例改变自己从不说教的态度，要大声疾呼：“孩子们！要警惕猴面包树！”为了警告我的朋友们，提防就在他们身边的这种危险，我才费了好大的劲画出了以下这幅画。为防备灾难，花些力气提出告诫，还是很值得的。

你们也许会问，为什么这本书里的其他插图，都不如这幅猴面包树画得有气势。原因很简单：画这幅画时，我是出自一种特别急切的心情，想要警告地球人；而我画其他插图时，虽说也想画得有气势，但都没有成功。





六


小王子啊，我就这么点点滴滴地了解了你凄凉多虑、可怜巴巴的生活。长期以来，你生活中的唯一乐趣，就是坐在那里观赏落日的柔美余晖。我得知这一新的细节，是在相识后第四天的早晨。当时，你对我说：

“我可喜欢看日落呢。咱们一起去观赏观赏吧……”

“那还要等些时候……”

“等到什么时候呀？”

“等到太阳下山。”

小王子先是感到很惊讶，接着自己就笑了起来，然后对我说：

“我老以为我还是在自己的家里呢！”

可不是吗？当美国是正午的时候，在法国却是太阳落山了，这是大家都知道的常识。因此，要想观赏落日，就得在一分钟左右的时间里赶到法国才能看到。遗憾的是，法国离美国太远了。但是，在小王子那颗小小的星球上，你只需要拖着你的椅子走几步就行了。所以呀，你一天什么时候想看落日都可以看到……



“有一天，我看了四十三次落日哩！”

过了一小会儿，你又说：

“你知道吗……一个人感到悲愁时，就喜欢看落日……”

“看四十三次落日的那一天，你真是那么悲愁吗？”

小王子没有回答我这个问题。





七


第五天，还是要归功于那只小绵羊，我终于知道了小王子生活的秘密。他突然直截了当地问我：

“要是一只绵羊啃了灌木丛，那它是不是还要吃花儿呢？”

“绵羊碰见什么就吃什么。”

“甚至连长了刺的花儿也吃吗？”

“是的，即使是长了刺的花儿，它也吃。”

“那么，这些刺，长了有什么用处？”

这个，我可不知道。当时我正忙着要把马达上的一颗拧得太紧的螺丝钉卸下来。我忧心忡忡，因为我开始意识到了，飞机的故障是十分严重的，而饮用水日益减少，更使我担心会出现最坏最坏的结果。

“那些刺有什么用处呢？”

小王子一旦提出一个问题，不追问出个究竟来，他就决不罢休。我对付不了的那颗螺丝钉，正搞得我心慌意乱，我就随便敷衍地答了一句：

“那些刺什么用处也没有，纯粹是那些花儿的坏性子在作怪！”

“哦！”

但是，他沉默了一小会儿后，带着不满情绪对我说：

“你说的我不信！花儿都柔嫩娇弱，她们天真老实。她们只求尽可能地保护自己，她们自以为长了那些刺别人就不敢碰了……”

我没有答理他。那当儿，我正在自言自语：

“这颗螺丝钉要是拧不下来，我就要用锤子把它敲下来。”

小王子又开腔打断我的思路，说：

“你相信，你，相信那些花儿……”

“不，不，我什么都不相信！我只是随便说说，我现在正忙着呢，我正在忙要紧的事！”

他惊呆地盯我一眼。

“要紧的事！”

他注视着我，我手里拿着锤子，手指被润滑油弄得黑糊糊的，正俯身审视一件他觉得很难看的东西。

“你现在说起话来，真像那些成年人。”

他这句话使我感到有点羞愧。接着，他又不留情面地说：

“你把什么东西都搅到一块儿了……你把所有一切都弄混了！”

他的的确确是气极了。他那头金发在风中飘动，他说：

“我知道有一颗星球上住着一位脸色绯红的先生。他从来没有闻过一朵花，从来没有见过一颗星星，从来没有爱过任何人。他除了做加法以外，没有干过别的事。他整天像你一样，老重复着说：‘我是个严肃认真的人！我是个严肃认真的人！’他自命不凡，骄傲自大。但他哪里能算一个人？只能算一个蘑菇！”

“只能算什么？”

“一个蘑菇！”

这时，小王子已经气得脸色煞白了。

“成千上万年以来，花儿都要长出花刺。尽管如此，成千上万年以来，绵羊还是要吃花儿。难道不应该认认真真地弄明白，花儿为什么还要费那么大劲去长出那些没有用的刺来呢？难道绵羊与花儿之间的战争不值得重视吗？难道这不比一个红红胖胖的先生整天弄来弄去的加法更为重要、更为严肃吗？还有，要是世界上有那么一朵独一无二的花儿，别的地方都没有，只有我那个星球上才有，而一只小绵羊一口就可以彻底灭绝它，如果不知道这是怎么弄的，难道还不严重吗？”

小王子的脸涨得通红，继续说道：

“如果有谁喜欢的那朵花儿，在千万颗星星中只此一朵，那么，他看着花儿的时候，自然会感到无比幸福。他会对自己说：‘我的那朵花儿在那边的什么地方呢……’但是，如果绵羊单把这花儿吃掉了，那对他来说，就如同所有的星星顷刻之间都熄灭啦！这样的事难道还不严重吗？”

他什么也说不下去了。他号啕大哭了起来。夜幕渐渐降临。我把自己的工具扔在一旁。我才不在乎我的锤子、我的螺丝钉哩，还有将要到来的口渴与死亡，也都去它的！在宇宙的一颗星球上，也就是在我这个地球上，有一个小王子需要安慰呀！我把他抱在怀里，轻轻地摇晃着他，对他说：

“你喜爱的那朵花儿没有碰上危险……我给你画的那只小绵羊马上就会戴上嘴套的……我还要给你的花儿画上武器……我……”

我实在不知道该怎么安慰他。我感到自己的嘴很笨。我也不知道怎么揣摩他的心思，怎么跟他交流思想……一旦流出了眼泪，其内心世界的感情是深不可测的。





八


很快，我对小王子所讲的那种花儿就更为了解了。在小王子的那颗星球上，一直就有一种很朴素的花儿，她们只有一圈花瓣，也不占什么地方，不妨碍别人。清晨，她们在草丛中开放，到了夜晚就凋谢了。不知是来自何方的种子发芽生长出了这种花儿。小王子曾经密切注视过她的嫩芽，发现她与众不同。他曾怀疑这也许是猴面包树的一个新变种，但见那小芽很快就不再长高了，而是开始准备开花儿啦。小王子亲眼看到一个饱满的花蕾正含苞待放，预感奇迹将要出现。那花儿却老躲在自己绿色闺房里精心打扮自己。她细心地挑选自己的色彩，从容地穿上彩衣，一瓣一瓣地修饰自己。她不愿意像罂粟花那样皱皱巴巴地舒展，而只肯光彩夺目地怒放。啊！的的确确，她娇美可爱！她那神奇的梳妆打扮是一天天逐渐完成的。终于在一天早晨，当太阳升起的时候，她露出了自己的容貌。

经过如此精心修饰之后，她一露面就打了一个哈欠说：

“啊！我刚刚睡醒……请您原谅……我还没有梳洗打扮呢……”

小王子这时情不自禁，大加赞扬说：

“您多么美丽呀！”

“是吗，”花儿温柔地答道，“我是跟太阳同时诞生的……”

小王子觉得她不怎么谦虚，但她是多么姿色秀美，楚楚动人啊！

“我想，现在该是用早餐的时候啦，”紧接着，她就补充一句，“能不能劳驾您给我……”

小王子因为对她照顾不周有些不好意思，于是，就提来一壶清水，给花儿浇灌。



从此，花儿习以为常，不断以她那有点乖戾任性的撒娇去麻烦小王子，使他不胜其烦。例如，有一天，在谈到她身上长着四根刺时，她对小王子说：



“老虎会来的呀，它们还有锐利的爪子呢！”

“我这颗星球上没有老虎，”小王子纠正她说，“何况，老虎也不吃草。”



“我并不是一棵草呀。”花儿柔声地说。

“抱歉，我弄错了……”

“其实我一点也不怕老虎，我倒是挺讨厌过堂风，您能给我当屏风，替我挡挡风吗？”

最讨厌过堂风……这对一株植物来说，可不是件好办的事。小王子注意到了这点，他想，这株花儿可真难侍候啊……

“夜里，请您拿个罩子把我罩住。您这个地方很冷。我在这里待得不舒服。说到我来的那个地方嘛……”

说到这里，她打住不往下说了。她是通过一粒花子儿惯常那样生根发芽的方式，土生土长在这颗星球上的，其他的星球她压根儿就没有见过。刚才那句谎话讲得实在幼稚可笑，她自己也感到羞愧，但为了骗得小王子真相信她弱不禁风，她故意咳嗽了两三声，又提出要求：

“屏风呢？……”



“我正准备去找哩，您不是还在跟我说话吗？”

于是，她为了要使小王子最终感到内疚后悔，又起劲地咳嗽个不停。

眼见这种情况，小王子即便对她充满了真挚的爱意与良好的愿望，现在也不信任她了。她过去那些华而不实的好言好语，小王子太认真在意了，结果反弄得自己很痛苦。

“我当时不该听她的话，”有一天，小王子推心置腹地对我说，“永远不要听花儿的花言巧语，观赏她们，呼吸她们的芬芳，这就行了。我的那朵花儿，的确曾使我那颗星球上飘溢着清香，可是我当时不懂得去享受，反倒是她所讲的老虎爪子的事，令我烦躁不安，也使得我去迁就她，照顾她。……”

小王子还坦诚告诉我说：

“那时，我什么都不懂！我应该根据她的行为而不是根据她的言辞去评判她。她使我沉浸在一片芬芳之中，使我心旷神怡。我不该从她身边逃走！我那时应该懂得，在她使性子、耍小手腕儿的背面，其实是对我的一片柔情！但我当时太年轻了，还不懂得如何去爱她。”

我猜想，他是乘着野生候鸟迁徙的时际，逃离他的星球的。动身的那天早晨，他把自己的星球收拾得井井有条。他仔仔细细给他的活火山打扫了喷发口。他有两座活火山。这对他每天做早饭特别方便。他还有一座已经熄灭的死火山。但是，正如他所说的：“谁知道它还会不会再喷发呢！”他也给这死火山清扫了喷发口。只要这些喷发口是通畅的，火山就会慢慢地、有规律地燃烧，而不会出现大爆发。其实，火山爆发就像我们壁炉里的火焰那样。当然，在地球上，要去打扫喷发口是做不到的，因为我们自己个头太小。这就是火山何以给地球人带来那么多麻烦的原因。

小王子临行前还拔除了刚刚破土而出的猴面包树嫩芽。他做这件事时略带伤感情绪，因为他觉得自己再也不会回来了。不过，这天早晨，所有这些家务活，他做起来都备感亲切。然后，他给花儿浇了最后一次水，又准备用罩子将她罩上，这时，他觉得自己真想痛哭一场。



“永别啦！”他对花儿说。

花儿咳嗽了，但并不是因为伤风感冒。

“我真是愚蠢，”她终于对他承认错误，“请你原谅我，祝你今后幸福！”

小王子因为她没有进行责备而感到诧异。他十分尴尬地站在那里，手里还拿着罩子。他不理解，花儿为什么这么温情脉脉，娴淑恬静。

“说真话，我是爱你的，”花儿对他敞开心扉，“但由于我的过错，你一点也不明白我的心意。现在说这些已没有什么意义了。可你也和我一样不聪明，但愿你今后幸福快活……把这个罩子扔到一边去吧，我再也不需要它了。”

“但是，刮起风来……”

“我并不是那么容易感冒……夜晚的清凉空气对我也有好处，我毕竟是一朵花儿。”

“但是，还有野兽呢……”

“要是我想认识蝴蝶，那么总得搭上两三条虫子。听说，蝴蝶非常美丽，要不然，谁来看望我呀？你嘛，你反正要远走高飞了，至于那些大个头的野兽，我才不怕哩，我也有自己的爪子。”

说着，她亮出自己那四根刺，天真幼稚地炫耀一番。然后说：

“你别拖拖拉拉了！这样真烦死人，你已经打定主意远走高飞，那就快走吧！”

她催他快动身，是因为不愿意让他看见自己哭泣。她是一朵个性强、脾气傲的花儿……

他进入了第325号小行星至330号小行星这六个星球所组成的星系。为了做些有用的事情并增长自己的学识，他开始一一拜访这些星球。

他最先拜访的那颗星星，上面住着一位国王。他身穿紫红色皇袍，上镶有白色貂皮，坐在一个极其简单却又非常威严的宝座上。

“哦，来了一个老百姓啦。”国王一见小王子就这么喊道。

于是，小王子自己纳闷了：

“他怎么会认识我呢？他从来没有见过我呀！”

他不懂得，对于那些国王来说，世界再简单不过，所有的人都只是他自己的臣民。

“你走过来，好让我看清楚你。”国王对小王子说，他终于有机会在某一个人面前摆摆国王的架子，因而得意扬扬。

小王子东瞧瞧西瞧瞧，想找个地方坐下，但是，这整个星球都被那件貂皮皇袍覆盖着。他只好站立一旁，因为太疲劳而打了个哈欠。

“在国王面前打哈欠，是违反宫廷规矩的，”这位君王告诫说，“我不许你这样做！”

“我实在控制不住自己，”小王子很难堪地答道，“我刚做了一次长途旅行，还没合过眼……”

“既然如此，”国王对他说，“我命令你打哈欠。多年以来，我从没有见过有人打哈欠。对我来说，打哈欠是个新鲜事儿。来吧！再打一个。这是命令。”

“这可把我吓坏啦……我想打也打不出来了……”小王子满脸通红地说。

“哼！哼！”国王回答说，“那么，我……我命令一会儿打哈欠，一会儿……”

他嘴里嘟嘟囔囔的，显得有些生气。

这是因为他最关心的是他的权威能否受到尊重。他不能容忍任何人违抗他的命令。他是一位极端专制的国王。不过，由于他生性善良，他下的命令倒都合情合理。

“假如我命令，”他倒背如流地说道，“假如我命令一位将军变成一只海鸟，而将军不服从命令，那不是将军的过错，那是我的过错。”

“我能坐下吗？”小王子怯生生地问他。

“我命令你坐下。”国王答道，以一种威严的神态将皇袍的一个下摆往回拉了拉。

见此，小王子感到很惊奇。这颗星星小得像粒弹丸，这位国王有什么可统治的呢？

“陛下……请允许我向您提个问题……”

“我命令你向我提问。”国王急忙作答。

“陛下……您统治些什么？”



“统治一切。”国王煞有介事，极为天真地这么回答。

“一切？”

国王做了一个神秘兮兮的手势，指指他那颗星球，又指指别的星球以及天空中的群星。

“所有这一切？”小王子问。

“所有这一切……”国王肯定地回答。

这么说来，他就不仅是一国的专制君主，而是整个宇宙的君王了。

“这些星星都服从您的统治？”

“当然啰，”国王回答说，“我的命令一下，他们就立即听命。我不能容忍无组织无纪律。”

这么一种令行禁止的权力，真使小王子赞叹不已。要是他自己也拥有这种权力，那他在自己那颗星球上，每天就不仅能够看四十四次日落，而且能看上七十二次，一百次，甚至是两百次，而且，要看的时候，根本就用不着将座椅挪来挪去！如今想起被他自己抛弃了的那颗小小的星球，他感到有些伤心了。于是，他鼓起勇气，请求国王的恩准：

“我想看一次日落……请陛下满足我这个愿望……请您命令太阳下山吧……”

“假如我命令一位将军像一只蝴蝶似的，从一朵花儿飞到另一朵花儿，或者命令他去写一部悲剧，或者命令他变成一只海鸟，而那位将军拒不执行我的命令，那么是算他错了还是算我错了？”

“那要算您的错。”小王子斩钉截铁地说。

“说得对。只能要求每个人去做他能够办得到的事情，”国王接着说，“权威首先要建立在理性之上。假如你命令自己的臣民百姓去跳海，那就会爆发革命。我有权要求大家都服从我的命令，因为我的命令都合情合理。”

“那么，我要看日落的那个请求呢？”小王子提醒他说，这个小家伙一旦提出什么问题，他总是要坚持到底的。

“你要看日落，你会看到的。我会对太阳下这道命令的。但是，出于我的领导智慧，我要等到时机成熟、水到渠成的时候，才会下这道命令。”

“那么我要等到什么时候呢？”小王子又问道。

“嗯！嗯！”国王先查阅一大本日历，然后回答说，“嗯！嗯！要等到，将近……将近……要等到今天晚上七点四十分左右！那时，你就可以看到我的命令是多么有效。”

小王子又打了个哈欠。他因为没有立刻看到日落而觉得遗憾。而且，他已经觉得这颗星球实在索然无味，叫人腻烦了。

“在陛下这儿，我没有什么可干的了，”他对国王说道，“我要走啦！”

“别走呀！”国王答道，他好不容易才有了一个臣民，正扬扬得意着呢，“你别走，我封你当大臣！”

“什么大臣呀？”

“……司法大臣！”

“可是，没有人可审判呀！”

“那可说不定。我还没有到全国巡视过一周呢。我太老了，也没有地方停放我的马车，走路嘛，我又觉得累得慌！”

“哦！可是您的王国，我一眼就已经望到头了。”小王子弯弯腰，又好好看了看这星球的那一半。“那一边也没有任何人呀……”

“那你就自己审判自己吧，”国王回答说，“这是世上最难的一件事。评判自己要比评判别人难得多。如果你清清楚楚、实实在在认识了自己，那你就是一个真正的智者！”

“我嘛，”小王子答道，“我可以随便到任何地方去认识认识自己，我不必住在这里呀！”

“嗯！嗯！”国王说，“我觉得我这个星球的某个地方，藏着一只老耗子。我夜里常听见它的声响。你可以去审判这只老耗子呀。你还可以时不时就判它一次死刑。这样，它的性命就全掌握在你的手心。但是，你每次判了它死刑后，还得恕它无罪，为的是留它一命，因为这个星球上只有它这么一只。”

“我呀，”小王子回绝道，“我才不爱去宣判死刑呢。我想，我是该走啦。”

“别走，别走。”国王再作挽留。

小王子心意已决，但他在做好了动身准备之后，为了不让老国王难受，建议说：

“如果陛下期望别人忠实地服从您的命令，那么您可以向我下达一道我所能执行的合理的命令。比如说，您可以命令我在一分钟之内就动身离开。那么，我就会觉得，您对我是宽大为怀、恩赐有加的……”

国王不答理他。小王子先犹豫了一小会儿，接着叹了口气，就动身走了。

“我封你为巡回大使！”国王赶紧大声下了最后一道命令。

他那股神气，可真是威严得很啊！

“成年人的确是很特别！”小王子在星际旅行之中，这么对自己说。





十一


第二颗星球上，住着一个虚荣心强、喜欢自吹自擂的人。

“啥！啥！一位崇拜我的人来访啦！”那位虚荣心强的主人，一见小王子，老远就这么喊道。

在那些爱虚荣者的眼里，其他所有的人都是他们的崇拜者。

“您好哇，”小王子致以问候，“您的帽子真逗呀！”

“这是为了打招呼敬礼时方便，”虚荣心强的那人答道，“这是为了在有人向我欢呼的时候，便于还礼。遗憾的是我这个星球从来就没有来客。”

“是吗？”小王子说，他不明白这是怎么回事。

“请用你这个巴掌拍那个巴掌。”对方建议道。

小王子照他的话做，双手鼓掌。虚荣心强的主人就脱帽答礼，以表示谦虚。

小王子心想，这么来拜访一个星球的君王，倒还有点意思。于是，他又开始双手鼓掌，而那位虚荣心强的主人，则又脱帽致答礼。

如此演练了五分钟之后，小王子对这机械重复、单调乏味的游戏不再感兴趣了。

“你说，要是帽子掉下来了，那该怎么办呀？”小王子问道。

但是，那个虚荣心强的主人充耳不闻。天下所有的爱虚荣者，除了奉承话以外，什么话都听不进去。



“你是不是真的非常崇拜我呀？”他问小王子。

“崇拜是什么意思呢？”

“崇拜，就是承认我是这个星球上最俊美、最衣冠楚楚、最富有、最有智慧的人。”

“可是，在你这个星球上，只有你一个人，并没有其他人呀？”

“让我高兴高兴吧！不论怎么说，还是崇拜崇拜我吧！”

“好吧，我就崇拜你吧，”小王子耸耸肩膀，不大情愿地这么说，“可是，要别人勉为其难地说崇拜你，对你有什么意义呢？”

说完，小王子就离开了这个星球。

“成年人的确是很古怪。”小王子在向另一个星球进发的途中这样想。





十二


下一个星球上，住着一个酒鬼。这次访问时间很短，却使小王子深深感到悲哀。

“你在干什么？”他问酒鬼。只见那人坐在那里一声不吭，面前堆着一些空酒瓶，还有一些装满了酒的酒瓶。

“我喝酒呀！”酒鬼答道，一副委靡不振的样子。

“你为什么要这么喝呀？”小王子问道。

“为了忘记。”酒鬼答道。

“忘记什么呀？”小王子又问，他已经开始怜悯这个人了。

“为了忘记我已经感到羞愧了。”酒鬼垂下头来招认说。

“你为什么感到羞愧？”小王子又问，他想帮助这人振作起来。



“我为喝酒而感到羞愧！”酒鬼说完，再也不吭声了。

“成年人都是古里古怪，无奇不有。”小王子在星际旅行之中这么想。





十三


第四颗星球上住的是生意人。此人忙得不亦乐乎，当小王子来到时，他甚至没有抬头看一眼。

“您好，”小王子招呼致意，“您的烟灭了。”

“三加二等于五。五加七，十二。十二加三，十五。您好。十五加七，二十二。二十二加六，二十八。烟灭了就灭了吧，没工夫再去点着。二十六加五，三十一。哎呀呀！总共加在一起是五亿零一百六十二万二千七百三十一。”

“五亿什么？”

“嘿，你还在这儿？五亿零一百万……我也搞不清……我有这么繁重的业务！我，我这个人工作很认真，我可没有兴趣说废话！二加五是七……”

“五亿零一百万的什么东西？”小王子重复问道，在这一辈子，他一旦提出某个问题，就一定要问个水落石出。

生意人抬起头来，说：

“自从我住在这颗星球上以来，五十四年之中，我只被打扰过三次。第一次是在二十二年前，天知道从什么地方掉下来一只金龟子。它发出的噪音，吵得我实在头痛，以致在一项加法中竟出了四个错。第二次是在十一年前，我得了关节炎。因为我缺少体育运动，我实在没有时间外出闲逛。我这个人，工作起来可认真哩。第三次被打扰……就是现在！我说五亿零一百万……”

“一百万什么呀？”小王子又问。

生意人总算明白了，面对这一个打扰者，自己别指望清静啦，他敷衍答了一句：

“就是成百万那种可以在天空里看见的小东西。”

“那就是苍蝇啰？”

“不是，是那些闪闪发亮的小东西。”

“是蜜蜂吗？”

“不是蜜蜂。就是令那些懒汉们胡思乱想的小玩意儿，金光闪闪的小玩意儿。但我是个严肃的正经人，我可没闲工夫去胡思乱想。”

“啊呀！您讲的是不是星星呀？”

“是的，就是星星！”

“那你要拿五亿颗星星干什么？”



“是五亿零一百六十二万二千七百三十一颗星星，我是个严肃认真的人，我对任何事情，都讲究精确。”

“你究竟要拿这么多星星干什么呀？”

“我干什么？”

“是呀，你要干什么？”

“什么也不干。我只想占有它们。”

“你要把这么多星星占为己有？”

“一点也没错。”

“可是，我前不久已经见到一位国王，他并不……”

“国王们不占有星球，他们是统治星球，这两者之间有极大的不同。”

“那你把这些星星都据为己有，是为了什么？”

“这样我就非常非常富有啦！”

“你要这么富有干什么呢？”

“为了再去买下其他的星星，如果新发现有别的星球的话。”

小王子心想，这家伙讲起歪理来，倒有点像我见到过的酒鬼。但他仍不断地提问：

“你怎么才能占有星星呢？”

“那你说它们归谁所有呢？”生意人气势汹汹地反问道。

“我不知道。它们不归任何人所有。”

“那不得了嘛，它们就归我所有，因为我是头一个想占有的人。”

“如此如此，难道就行了？”

“当然。你发现了一颗无主的钻石，它自然就归你所有了，当你找到了一个没有主人的岛屿，你也就成为了这岛屿的主人。当你第一个产生一个主意，你就要取得它的所有权，它就成为你的专有物。而我呢，我占有星星，因为在我之前，从来就没有人想到要占有它们。”

“这倒的确是真的，”小王子说，”那你要用它们干什么呢？”

“我管理它们呀。我对它们进行核算，进行统计，然后再核算再统计，”生意人说，“这件工作可费劲啦，但我是一个严肃认真的人！”

小王子对他的回答还是不满意。

“要是我呀，如果有一条围巾，我就会把它围在我的脖子上。如果有一朵花儿，我就会把它摘下来，佩戴在自己身上。可你总不可能去摘星星吧！”

“是不可能，可是我能够把它们存到银行里去。”

“这是什么意思？”

“这就是说，我在一张小纸条上，写下我占有星星的总数，然后，把这张纸条锁进一个抽屉里。”

“这就齐了？”

“这就齐了！”

小王子心想：“这可真逗，这个做法倒有点诗意，但是不大严肃正经。”

小王子对事情是否严肃正经的标准，与成年人对此的标准，的确相距很远。

“我呀，”他这样说，“我占有过一朵花儿，我曾天天给她浇水。我也占有过三座火山，我每个星期都替它们清扫喷发口。而且，我还给那已经熄灭的死火山清扫出口。谁能预料它会不会再喷发呢？我这样占有我的火山，对火山有利；我这样占有我的花儿，对花儿有利。但是，你这种占有方式，对星星毫无好处。”

那生意人张着大嘴，答不上话来。于是，小王子扬长而去，离开了这个星球。

“成人们真是古里古怪，无奇不有。”小王子这么想着，继续他的星际长途旅行。





十四


第五颗星球非常非常奇特。它在所有的星球中可算是最小的。它那儿的面积，只够立一盏路灯、站一个守灯人。小王子真难以理解，为什么在广阔的太空之中，在一颗既没有房屋又没有居民的星球之上，偏偏要有一盏路灯和一个守灯人。不过，他还是对自己做了一番解释：

“或许这个守灯人也是个荒唐的家伙，但他并不如那个爱虚荣的人、那个生意人、那个酒鬼荒唐得那么厉害。至少，他做的工作还是有意义的。当他点燃他的路灯时，他就像是使得一颗星星或者使得一朵花儿有了生命，而当他熄灭他的路灯时，就像是要花儿或星星入睡。这个差事其实很美好。既然它美好，那当然就是有用有意义的。”

他到达这星球上时，立即毕恭毕敬向守灯人致敬，说：

“你好！你干吗把你的路灯熄掉？”

“我是根据指令。”守灯人回答说，“早安。”

“什么叫做指令呀？”

“就是要我熄掉路灯。”那人又道了一声，“晚安。”

他说着，又把路灯点亮了。

“你干吗又把灯点亮呢？”

“我也是按照指令呀。”守灯人答道。

“我弄不懂。”小王子说。

“这里面没有什么需要你弄懂的，”守灯人说，“指令就是指令。早安。”说着，他又把路灯熄了。接着，他拿出一块红色方格手帕，揩揩自己的额头。他说：

“我这个职业太可怕了。先前干这一行还说得过去，早晨熄灯，傍晚点灯，白天的剩余时间我休息，夜晚的剩余时间我睡觉……”

“这么说来，自从那个时期以后，指令改变啦？”

“指令并没有改变，”守灯人说，“麻烦恰恰就出在这里！星球一年比一年转动得快，而指令却没有相应的变化！”

“那又怎么样呢？”

“现在，星球一分钟自转一周，我连一秒钟休息的时间也没有了。每一分钟，我就得点一次灯，紧接着又熄一次灯！”



“这真荒唐可笑！在你这个星球上，一天的时光，只有一分钟的长度！”

“这一点也不奇怪，”守灯人说，“咱们俩刚才说话的这一工夫，一个月就已经过去啦！”

“整整一个月？”

“是呀。三十分钟，正好是三十天！晚安！”

说着，他又点亮了那盏路灯。

小王子定睛瞧了瞧守灯人，觉得自己喜欢上这个人了，他是那么忠于指令，一丝不苟。这时，他回想起自己从前拖着椅子去赶着看落日的情形。他已经把眼前的此人视为朋友，他想要帮帮他：

“你知道吗？我有一个办法让你在想要休息的时候，能够停歇下来……”

“我呀，我想永远歇下去。”守灯人说。

他这么说情有可原，一个人既可以做到忠于职守，也很可能本是懒惰成性的。

小王子接着说下去：

“你的星球这么小，跨上三步就可以绕上一周。你只要慢速步行，你就能老是面向着太阳。当你想休息的时候，你就往前走……这么一来，你想要一天有多长，这天就会有多长。”

“这对我并没有多大用处，”守灯人说，“在生活里，我就是爱睡觉。”

“你睡觉的机会可没有。”小王子说。

“那就谈不上有什么机会啦。”守灯人说，“早安。”说着，他又灭了那盏路灯。

小王子又继续他的星际旅行，在途中他这样想：“以上我所碰见的那几个人，国王、爱虚荣者、酒鬼与生意人，他们一定都瞧不起这个守灯者。但是，我觉得他才是唯一一个不荒唐可笑的人。之所以如此，也许是因为他所关心的，并不是他自己，而是其他的事情。”

他遗憾地叹了一口气，又想：

“这个人是唯一可以成为我的朋友的人。可惜，他那个星球实在太小，待不下两个人……”

实际上，这个星球叫小王子感到可惜的真正原因是：这里每二十四小时，就碰上一千四百四十次日落。只不过，他不敢承认这一点罢了。





十五


第六颗星球比第五颗星球要大十倍。那里住着一位老先生，他正在写一部大部头著作。

“瞧！来了一个勘察者！”他一见小王子，就这么喊道。

小王子往桌子上一坐，有些气喘吁吁，他已经在长途旅行中跑了很久！

“你是从哪里来的？”老先生问道。

“这是一本什么书这么厚呀？”小王子问，“您在这儿干什么？”

“我是个地理学家。”老先生说。

“地理学家是干什么的？”

“就是学者，知道海洋、河流、城市、山脉与沙漠位于何处的学者。”

“这太有意思了，”小王子发表评论说，“这是一种真正的职业！”他瞧了瞧地理学家这颗星球的情况，觉得自己从来没有见过一颗像这样有气魄的星球。



“您的星球真是太美啦！这儿有海洋吗？”

“我不知道有没有。”地理学家答道。

“哦！”小王子对他的回答深感失望，又问，“那么，有没有山脉呢？”

“我也不知道有没有。”地理学家还是同一个回答。

“有城市、河流与沙漠吗？”

“我也不知道有没有。”地理学家一问三不知。

“可您是地理学家呀！”

“的确是，”地理学家说，“但我不是个勘察者。我这儿特别需要探险家。统计调查那些城市、山川、河流与沙漠，这些事不是地理学家应该去干的活儿，而是勘察者的活儿。地理学家太重要了，他没有时间去游山逛水。他从不离开办公室，但他接待那些勘察者，听取汇报，仔细询问，并把他们的陈述记录下来。如果他们之中某个人的陈述引起了他的重视，那么还得对那陈述者的思想道德状况进行审查。”

“为什么要这么做？”

“因为一个勘察者如果撒了谎，那就会给地理学家写的书带来严重的错误。同样，一个嗜酒贪杯的勘察者，也会造成严重的后果。”

“那是怎么回事呢？”

“因为在酒鬼眼里，什么东西都会有重影。地理学家根据他的陈述，记录下来有两座山，其实那个地方只有一座。”

“我认识一个人，”小王子说，“他一定是个坏事的勘察者。”

“那完全可能，”地理学家说，“即使勘察者的思想道德状况完全正常，我还要对他陈述的结果进行调查核实。”

“是去当地察看吗？”

“不，那样太麻烦。只要勘察者提供证据，例如，关于一座大山，就要求他带回若干块岩石。”

说到这里，地理学家突然打住。

“可是你呀，你是来自遥远的天边！你也是勘察者！你把你那个星球描述描述给我听吧！”

于是，地理学家打开他的笔记本，削尖他的铅笔。一般说来，他总是先用铅笔记录下勘察者的陈述，要等到勘察者提供了物证之后，他才用墨水笔正式记录。

“怎么样，说说吧！”地理学家问道。

“哦，在我那儿，”小王子说，“没有多少可说的，我那儿特别小，有三座火山，两座活火山，一座死火山，不过，是不是真死了，还难说。”

“还难说。”地理学家重复了一句。

“我还有一株花儿。”

“花卉不在我们的记录范围之列。”地理学家说。

“这是为什么呀？我的那株花儿要算是最美丽的了。”

“因为花草都是朝生暮死，好景不常的。”

“好景不常，这是什么意思？”

“地理著作，”这位老先生说道，“是所有的书籍中最为珍贵的书籍。这类著作永远也不会过时。世上的山，从没有见过有移动搬家的；世上的海，也不见有干枯消失的。我们地理学家记载下来的，都是一些永世长存的东西。”

“但是，死火山也可能重新喷发呀！”小王子打断他的话，又问，“您所说的‘好景不常’是什么意思？”

地理学家答道：“不论火山是死了还是仍在活动，对我们这些人来说，其意义都是同样的，在我们看来，它就是山，在这个意义上它亘古不变。”

“但您说的‘好景不常’，究竟是什么意思呀？”小王子再一次追问，他一旦提出一个问题，就一定要打破沙锅问到底，他一贯都是如此。

“这就是说，受到了某种威胁，不久就会消失。”

“我的那朵花儿也是受到某种威胁，将要消失吗？”

“当然。”

“我的花儿好景不常，”小王子心想，“何况她只有四根刺可以保护自己，对付整个世界！而我，我竟然将她孤零零地扔在家里！”

这是小王子生平第一次感到后悔，但他仍打起精神，问那位老先生：



“您建议我再到什么地方去访问访问？”

地理学家回答说：“到地球那个星球去吧，它有良好的名声……”

小王子采纳了这个建议，立即动身。在途中他仍惦记着他的那朵花儿。





十六


第七颗星星就是地球。

地球可不是一颗一般的星球！在那颗星星上，有一百一十一个国王（当然，包括那些黑人国王），七千个地理学家，九十万个生意人，七千五百万个酒鬼，三亿一千一百万自大狂，也就是说，有将近二十亿个成年人。

为了使你们对地球的大小有一个概念，我要告诉你们，在地球上发明电力以前，六大洲共需四十六万两千五百一十一名点路灯的人，这本身就是一支真正的大军。

如果从远处眺望，其效果是极其辉煌壮丽的。这支点灯大军的动作，就像歌剧院里芭蕾舞演员的动作那样协调一致，和谐有序。首先上场的是新西兰与澳大利亚的点灯人，他们点亮了路灯之后就去睡觉去了。接着，轮到中国与西伯利亚的点灯人，他们跳着舞登场表演，然后隐没到幕后。下面，是轮到俄国与印度的点灯人登场；而后，是非洲的与欧洲的；再后，是南美洲的；最后则是北美洲的。一队一队，按顺序出场，有条不紊，真是蔚为壮观。

只有两个点灯人是闲得无聊的，一个是北极那唯一一盏路灯的点灯人，另一个则是南极的那一位，他们在一年里只需点两次灯就行了。





十七


当一个人想说点什么哗众取宠时，他往往就多多少少有点夸大其词。我在上面向你们讲点灯人的时候，我讲得并不那么老老实实。我几乎使那些不了解我们地球的人，得出一个错误的观念，以为人类在地球上只占有很小的空间。因为居住在这个星球上的二十亿人，假若互相紧挨着站在一起，像在一个群众集会上那样，他们满可以舒舒服服集中在一块只有二十英里长、二十英里宽的公共场所里，甚至满可以聚居在太平洋上任何一个最小的岛屿上。

当然了，那些成年人是不会相信你们的。他们自以为可占有广大的地盘，他们自认为像猴面包树一样举足轻重。最好是建议他们去好好算一笔账。他们最崇拜数目字，一跟数目字打交道，他们就乐不可支。不过，在这件叫人厌烦的事情上，你可不要浪费时间。算来算去，到头来毫无用处。你们尽管相信我好啦。

小王子一来到地球上，没有看见有任何人，心里感到很奇怪。他开始暗暗担心自己跑错了星球。这时，他看到一个银白色环形的动物在沙堆上蠕动。

“晚安。”小王子随便顺口地说了一声。

“晚安。”对方答应了一声，那是一条蛇。

“我落在哪一颗星球上啦？”小王子问道。

“你是落在地球上，在非洲。”那蛇答道。

“哦！地球上怎么没有人呢？”

“这里是沙漠，沙漠是无人地带。地球可是大着呢。”那蛇解释说。

小王子在一块石头上坐下，举目望天。

“我在想，”他说，“天空的星星亮晶晶的，是不是为了要让地上的每个人，有一天能够找到自己的那一颗。你瞧，我的那颗，正在我们头顶上……它离我们真远呀！”

“你那颗星星真美丽，”蛇说，“你来地球上干什么呀？”

“我和一朵花儿闹别扭了。”小王子答道。

那蛇只应了一声：“哦！”

接着，他们都不吱声了。

“地球人在哪儿呢？”小王子终于打破沉默问道，“在沙漠里可真有些孤独啊……”

“和地球人在一起，也是孤独的。”蛇说。

小王子盯着蛇看了好一会儿，才发表自己的观感：“你可真是奇怪的动物，身子细得像一根手指……”

“但是我可比一个国王的手指头要强大得多。”蛇说。

小王子微微一笑道：

“你并不那么强大，你连爪子都没有……你根本就没法去旅行……”



蛇反驳说：“我还能带着你去旅行哩，比一艘船驶得更远。”

说着，它缠绕在小王子的脚腕上，好像一只金镯子。它说：

“我一缠绕上谁，就可以把谁送回他原来那颗星球上去。你完全是天真纯洁的，而且又是天外一颗星星上来的……”

小王子没有接它的话茬。蛇又接着说：

“你在这个荒凉冷酷的地球上，是多么弱小无助啊，我真怜悯你。如果你有一天思念自己的星球思念得实在受不了，我那时候就会来帮你……”

小王子说：“哦，我很明白你说的意思，但为什么你讲起话来就像打谜语似的？”

“我会把所有的谜底解答出来的。”蛇答道。

他们又沉默不语了。





十八


小王子徒步穿过沙漠，途中只遇见一株花儿。那是一朵只有三片花瓣的花儿，普普通通，平淡无奇……

“你好。”小王子向她致意。

“你好。”花儿答礼说。

小王子彬彬有礼地向她打听：



“地球人在什么地方呀？”

花儿曾经有一天见过一支商队经过，她答道：

“人吗？的确有，我想，有那么六七个吧，好些年前我见过他们。但现在谁也不知道在什么地方可以找到他们。他们随风漂泊。他们没有根，这对他们很不利。”

小王子说：“永别啦！”

花儿答道：“永别啦！”





十九


小王子攀上了一座高山的顶巅。从前，他见过的山，只有他家乡那三座高不过膝的火山，而且，他还把那座死火山，当做小板凳来用呢。现在他来到这么高的高山之巅，心里以为就能一眼看到地球上所有的人了……然而，除了一大片高峰的尖顶外，什么也没有见到。

“你好。”他漫不经心地叫了一声。

“你好……你好……你好……”下面的群山发出回音。

“你是谁？”小王子问了一声。

“你是谁……你是谁……你是谁……”又响起了一阵回音。

“当我的朋友吧，我孤孤单单呀。”他喊了一声。

“我孤孤单单呀……我孤孤单单……我孤孤单单……”又是一阵回音。

这时，小王子心想：“这个星球真古怪，它贫瘠枯燥，瘦骨嶙峋，苦涩发咸。还有，那些地球人，完全没有个性，没有想象力，只会重复别人对他们说过的话……还不如在我那颗星球上，好歹我还有一朵花儿，她总是主动先跟我说话……”





二十


小王子经过长途跋涉，穿过沙漠、越过岩石、通过雪地之后，终于找到一条阳关大道。其实，条条大路，都通向人群聚集之处。

他来到一个玫瑰花盛开的花园，他当即表示问候：“你们好！”

朵朵玫瑰花都答礼说：“你好！”



小王子注视她们，发现她们全都跟他的那朵花儿十分相像。

小王子惊奇地问道：

“你们是谁呀？”

“我们全是玫瑰。”花儿们答道。

“哦！……”小王子应了一声。

他感到自己真不幸。他的那朵花儿曾经告诉他说，在天地宇宙之中，她是独一无二的一朵玫瑰花。可是，在眼前这个花园里，就有五千朵和她一模一样的花儿！

小王子心想：

“如果她看到眼前这片景象，肯定会羞窘得无地自容……她准会使劲地咳嗽个不停，为了逃避这种尴尬，她甚至会倒下装死。而我呢，我就不得不装装样子去照顾照顾她。否则，她为了要让我感到内疚，也许真的会自暴自弃去寻短见……”

接着，他又心想：

“我本来以为自己非常富足，拥有天下独一无二的一朵花儿，实际上，我有的只是普普通通的一朵玫瑰。我的全部财富只有这朵花儿再加上那三座高度刚到我膝盖的火山，而且其中一座还是永远熄灭了的死火山，这么一点点家当，不可能使我成为一个伟大的君王……”想到这里，他扑倒在地，大声痛哭起来。





二十一


正在这时，来了一只狐狸。

“你好。”狐狸向他问候。

“你好。”小王子彬彬有礼地答道，他转过头去，但是什么也没有看见。

“我在这里，就在苹果树下……”那声音说。

“你是谁呀？”小王子看见了它说，“你真漂亮……”

“我是一只狐狸。”

“来跟我玩玩吧，”小王子诚恳相邀，“我现在正伤心着呢……”

“我不能跟你一道玩，”狐狸说，“我不是温驯的动物。”

“哦！我不了解你，对不起。”小王子说。

但是，他稍作思索后，问道：

“什么叫‘温驯’呀？”



“看来你不是本地人，”狐狸说，“你来这里干什么？”

“我在找地球人，”小王子又追问，“‘温驯’是什么意思呀？”

“地球人呀，”狐狸说，“他们有枪，他们经常打猎。这可危害不小！他们还饲养母鸡，那是他们唯一有意思的地方。你要找母鸡吗？”

“不找，”小王子说，“我要找朋友，你说的‘温驯’是什么意思？”

狐狸开始作出解释：

“这是一件好事，可惜已经被忘得一干二净了，‘温驯’意味着建立和谐的关系……”

“建立和谐的关系？”小王子不明白。

“当然是这个意思，”狐狸接着解释，“对我而言，你只是一个小男孩，和成千上万的小男孩完全一样。我并不需要你，你也不需要我。对你而言，我只是一只狐狸，和成千上万的狐狸没有两样。但是，如果你使我温驯了，我们两者之间的关系就变得互相依存依恋。那么一来，对我而言，你就是这世上的唯一，而对你而言，我也就是这世上的唯一……”

“我开始懂得了，”小王子说，“我拥有那么一朵花儿……我想，可以说她使我温驯了……”

“这完全是可能的，”狐狸说，“在地球上，可以看到形形色色、无奇不有的事情……”



“唉！我跟我那朵花儿的事，并不是在地球上呀。”

狐狸显得很诧异，问道：

“难道是在别的星球上吗？”

“是的。”

“在你那个星球上，有猎人吗？”

“没有。”

“这可太好啦！那么，有母鸡吃吗？”

“没有。”

“这可有些美中不足！”狐狸悲叹了一声。

但狐狸又回到它原来的话题，说：

“我的生活单调乏味。我猎食母鸡，地球人则猎杀我。母鸡全是一个样子，所有人类也都一个样。我对这一切都感到有点腻味了，但如果你使得我温驯了，我的生活就会充满了阳光，变得温暖。我对人类的脚步声就会有全然不同的感受。我一听到其他陌生人的脚步声，就会赶紧逃进地洞。你的脚步声，却会把我从地洞里召唤出来，有音乐一般的奇效。还有，你看，你看见那边的麦田了吗？我是不吃面包的，小麦对我毫无用处。麦田不会引起我任何回忆。当然，这也是很可惜的事！但是，你有一头金发，于是，一旦你驯服了我，事情将变得妙不可言，那金色的小麦就会使我回想起你，而我，也就会爱上那风儿掠过麦田所发出的声音……”

狐狸停了下来，久久地注视着小王子，又说：

“求求你……把我收下来吧，驯养我吧。”

“我很乐意这样做，”小王子答道，“可是我没有多少时间，我还得去结识好多朋友，去了解很多事情。”

“只有那些被人驯服了的东西，才能被人理解，”狐狸说，“地球人是不会再有时间去认识什么啦，他们都是从商人那里购买一切成品。但因为世上的商人绝不会成为朋友，地球人也就没有朋友了，如果你想要一个朋友，那就请驯养我吧！”

“该怎么驯养呢？”小王子问道。

“必须很有耐心，”狐狸答道，“你先坐在草地上，要离我稍远一点，就像现在这样。我嘛，我斜眼盯着你，你什么话也别说。语言是造成隔阂与误解的根由。但是，你可以每天坐得越来越靠近我一些……”

第二天，小王子来到原地。

“最好是在同一时间赴约，”狐狸说，“比方说，你定在下午四点钟来，那我从三点钟开始就会感到高兴。会面的时刻愈是临近，我就愈发感到高兴。一到四点钟，我就会激动起来，兴奋起来，我会认识到要获得幸福是要付出代价的！可是，如果你什么时候来压根就没准儿，那我就不知道该在什么时候酝酿我的心情……会面就得有会面的讲究。”

“什么叫做‘讲究’呀？”小王子问。

“这也是被人忘得一干二净的事啦。”狐狸说，“某种讲究，就可以使得某一个日子、某一个时辰有别于其他的日子、其他的时辰。举个例子来说，与我为敌的那些猎人就有一种讲究，他们每逢星期四一定要去跟村里的姑娘跳舞。于是，星期四就成了妙不可言的一天啦，我就可以到处闲逛，一直逛到葡萄园里。而如果那些猎人什么时候都要去跳舞，那么，天天就都一个样啦。”

就这样，小王子驯养了狐狸。不久，他们分手的时候临近了，狐狸伤感地说：

“唉，我会哭的……”

“那你就不对了，”小王子说，“我不希望你伤心，你该记得，是你要我驯养你的……”

“当然是我要求的。”狐狸说。

“那你还要哭什么！”小王子说。

“我当然要哭。”狐狸说。

“你这样岂不是得不偿失！”

“我还是有收获的，因为，我可以从小麦的金黄色感受到美感了。”狐狸说。接着，它又说：

“你再去看看那些玫瑰花吧，你就会明白你家里的那一朵玫瑰才是世上独一无二的。然后你再回来和我告别，到时候我要送你一件礼物。告诉你一个秘密。”

小王子去看望了那些玫瑰。他对她们说：

“你们和我家里那朵玫瑰完全不一样。你们算不上什么。谁也没有培植过你们，你们也没有跟任何人建立感情。你们就像我还不认识那只狐狸时一样。那时，它与世上成百上千只狐狸一样，跟我毫无交情。但后来，我和它成为了朋友，现在，在世界上，它对我而言就是独一无二的一只狐狸了。”

听了小王子一席话，那些玫瑰花都感到很不舒服。小王子又继续说：

“你们长得很漂亮，但是你们却很空虚。谁也不会为你们献出生命。至于我自己的那朵玫瑰，一个普通的路人当然会以为她与你们并没有什么不同。但是，只她一朵花儿就比你们所有花儿加在一起还要重要得多。因为我给她浇过水，因为我用罩子保护过她，用屏风给她挡过风，因为我为了她才杀死那些毛毛虫（两三条将变为蝴蝶的除外），因为我倾听过她的抱怨，她的自吹自夸，而当她一声不吭时，则和她默默相对。总而言之，一句话，因为她是我的玫瑰。”

而后，小王子又回来跟狐狸道别，他说：

“别了！”

“别了！”狐狸说，“我要告诉你的秘密，其实很简单，那就是：人只能用心灵去观察，去感受。要知道，光靠肉眼，是不可能看到本质的东西的。”

“光靠肉眼，不可能看到本质的东西。”小王子重复说了一遍，为的是牢牢记在心里。

“你为自己的那朵玫瑰花费了一些时间，她才对你变得重要。”

“我为我的那朵玫瑰花费了时间……”为了牢牢记住，小王子又重复一遍。

“地球人忘记了这个真理，”狐狸说，“但你不应该忘记。凡是你培植过、驯养过的一切，你对它们是负有责任的。你要对你那朵玫瑰尽心尽责……”

“我要对我的那朵玫瑰尽心尽责……”为了牢记在心，小王子又重复了一遍。





二十二


“你好。”小王子说。

“你好。”扳道工答道。

“你在这里干什么呀？”小王子问。

“我正在对一大批一大批旅客进行调度，”扳道工说，“我把他们乘坐的那些火车，有的调往左，有的调往右，让它们一一开走。”

只见一列灯光明亮的快车，发出雷鸣般的响声，急驶而来，震得扳道工的那个木板屋微微颤抖。

“这些旅客真是急急匆匆的呀，”小王子说，“他们要追求什么东西呢？”

“开火车的司机也不知道。”扳道工说。

从相反的方向，又有一列灯光明亮的快车呼啸而来。

“刚才那些旅客这么快就回来了？”小王子问道。“这不是刚才那一列车，”扳道工说，“这是对开的另一列车。”

“这些旅客是对他们原来待的那个地方不喜欢，不满意吗？”

“人永远不会对自己原来待的地方感到满意。”扳道工答道。

这时，第三列灯光明亮的快车，又轰隆而过。

“他们在追赶第一列火车里的旅客？”小王子问道。

“他们不是在追赶谁，”扳道工答道，“他们都在车厢里睡大觉呢，要不就是在打哈欠。只有那些小孩把脸紧贴着玻璃窗朝车外观看。”

“只有孩子才知道自己要寻找什么，”小王子说，“他们为了用碎布头做一个玩具娃娃，真舍得花时间。因此，这玩具娃娃就成为了他最珍贵的宝贝，如果被别人拿走，他就会伤心大哭……”

“孩子们才真正有自己的乐趣。”扳道工感慨道。





二十三


“你好！”小王子问候说。

“你好！”商人答道。

这个商人专门出售一种生津解渴的改良药丸。每个星期吞服一粒，就不会感到口渴。



“你卖这东西干什么呢？”小王子问。

“服用这种药，可以大大地节省时间，”商人说，“据专家测算，每个星期可以省出五十三分钟。”

“那么，拿这五十三分钟干什么呀？”

“干自己想干的事呗……”

“要是我呀，”小王子自言自语说，“我如果有五十三分钟可以随意支配，那我一定慢慢地朝一口水井走去……”





二十四


现在，是我的飞机被困沙漠的第八天，我喝完了最后一滴饮用水，正在这时，我听见小王子讲述那个卖解渴丸的商人。

“啊，你这些回忆都挺好听，”我对小王子说，“不过，我还没有把飞机修好，我的饮用水就喝光了，如果我能如你所想象的那样，慢慢走向一口水井，那该多么幸福呀！”

“我的狐狸朋友……”小王子又准备回忆别的事情。

“我的小家伙，现在的问题不是什么狐狸不狐狸的啦。”

“怎么啦？”

“我都快要渴死啦……”

他不理解我的顾虑，回答说：

“即便是快死了，曾经有过一个朋友也是件好事。就说我吧，我就很高兴自己曾经有过一个狐狸朋友……”

我听了他这话，心想：“他哪里懂得什么叫生存危机呢，他自己从来就不渴不饿，只要有一点点阳光，他就能活下去……”

但是，他看了我一眼，对我心里的想法作了一个回答：

“我也渴啦……我们去找口水井吧……”

我做了个懒得答理的手势。要想碰碰运气，在漫无边际的沙漠里找到一口水井，那简直是荒唐可笑。然而，我还是跟他一道出发了。

我们闷声地步行了好几个小时，夜幕降临了，星星开始在夜空中闪烁。我望着星星，有如在梦境之中，由于口渴难耐，我有点发烧了。小王子所讲的那些话，一句句在我脑子里蹦蹦跳跳。

“你也会口渴？你渴了吗？”我问他。

他并没有直接回答我的问题，而是诚恳地对我说：

“对心灵来说，水也是必要的，有益的呀……”

我不懂得他这答话是什么意思，但我不再吱声了……我这时明白了，我不该再去向他提问。

小王子累了。他坐了下来。我也在他身边坐下。在片刻沉默之后，他说：

“天空里的星星真美丽，因为那儿有一株我看不见的花儿……”

我回答说：“当然啦。”下面我没有接着说，我无言地望着月光下的沙漠像波浪似的向远方扩展。

“沙漠真美！”他又补充了一句。

沙漠的确很美。我一直喜爱沙漠。你如果坐在一个沙丘上，你会什么也看不见，什么也听不见，但在这一大片静寂无声之中，却有某种东西在熠熠生辉。

小王子说：

“使得沙漠显得美丽的，正是它的某个地方藏着一口水井……”

突然之间，我惊奇地发现自己茅塞顿开，明白了沙漠的神秘光辉何在。当我还是个小男孩的时候，我曾经住在一个古老的宅子里。那时，传说这个宅子里某个地方埋藏着一大笔财宝。当然，这笔财宝从没有被人发现，甚至可能压根就没有人去找过。但是，这个传说却使得这所古宅平添魅力。我的住宅深处竟藏着这样一个秘密呀……

“是的，”我对小王子说，“正是某种看不见、摸不着的东西，使得住宅、星星或沙漠，似乎具有了神秘的美！”

“我真高兴，”小王子说，“你的意见与我的狐狸朋友完全一致。”

因为小王子睡着了，我便把他抱在怀里，仍继续往前走。一路上，我一直很激动，我觉得自己是抱着一件娇嫩易碎的宝物。我甚至觉得他要算世界上最最娇嫩的宝贝了。我借着月光，端详他苍白的额头，紧闭的双目，微风吹拂的发梢，我心想：“眼前我看到的只是一个小小的躯体，但他还有我肉眼看不见的东西，那才是最最重要的东西……”

这时，他微微张开的双唇流露出一丝微笑，我心想：“这个熟睡的小王子最使我大为感动的，是他对一朵花儿的忠心耿耿，在他心里，那朵玫瑰花一直像盏长明灯那样永放光芒，即便在他酣睡的时候也是如此……”想到这里，我觉得他比我想象的更要娇嫩。他像一盏临风的油灯，一股风就足以将他吹灭，我必须格外小心翼翼地保护好他。

就这样，我抱着他走着，走着，一直走到拂晓。这时，我终于发现了一口水井。





二十五


“那些旅客，”小王子发表感慨说，“一头扎进了快车的车厢，却并不知道自己要去追寻什么。于是，就躁动不安，转来转去，在原地兜圈子……”

接着，他又加上一句：

“他们这么奔波，根本就不值得……”

我们找到的那口水井，不像是撒哈拉沙漠里的井。沙漠里的井通常是在沙土中挖掘而成的，只是一个简单的坑坑。那口井倒像是村庄里的井，但是在这个地区并没有任何村落呀，我真以为是在做梦。

“真奇怪，”我对小王子说，“器械全都齐备，辘轳、水桶，还有绳子，应有尽有……”

小王子笑了，他摸摸绳子，把辘轳转动起来，辘轳发出吱呀声，就像一个老掉牙的风信标在清风静止时发出来的哀叹。



“你听，”小王子说，“我们唤醒了这口井，它开始歌唱了……”

我不愿意让他出力费劲。

“让我来吧，”我对他说，“这活儿对你来说太重了。”

我慢慢地把水桶拉到井台上，端端正正放在那儿。辘轳的歌声还缭绕在我耳际，从水桶里仍在微微晃动的水中，我看到太阳也在晃动。

“我口渴，很想喝这水，”小王子说，“请给我喝吧……”

我明白了他一直想要追求的东西是什么！

我把水桶举起来，凑到他的唇边。他闭着眼睛，喝了起来，显得美滋滋的，像是在过节。这水可与一般的食物很不相同，它是我们在星光下长途跋涉之后得来的，是在辘轳的歌声中，靠我的双臂提上来的。这水就像一件嘉奖的礼品，它滋润着我们的心田。在我从前还是个小男孩的岁月里，也曾尝到同样的快乐，每当我得到圣诞礼物时，圣诞树上的烛光、午夜弥撒的音乐声、亲人们温馨的微笑，就使得那礼物更显得光彩夺目。

“你们地球人，”小王子发表评论说，“能够在同一个花园里，培植出五千株玫瑰……但是却找不到自己所要追求的东西……”

“他们确实没有找到……”我答道。

“其实，他们所要追求的东西，很可能就藏在一朵孤零零的玫瑰花中，或者在少许一点水里……”

“的确如此。”我答道。

小王子又补充了一句：

“不过，肉眼往往视而不见，必须靠心灵去寻找。”

我喝完了水，感到呼吸也舒畅多了。在清晨的阳光照耀下，沙漠的景色好像是一盘蜂蜜，这蜂蜜般的景色也使我感到欣慰，我为什么要去发愁着急呢……

“你可得遵守你的诺言呀！”小王子温柔地对我说，他又坐在了我的身边。“什么诺言？”“你知道的……你说过要给我的绵羊画上一个嘴套……我有责任保护我那朵花儿！”

我立即从我的口袋掏出我画的那些草图，小王子见了笑着说：

“你的猴面包树画成什么样子了呀……简直就有点像卷心菜……”

“哦！”我还一直为自己画的猴面包树而扬扬得意哩！

“你画的狐狸……瞧它的耳朵，像两只角，画得太长啦！”

他还在笑个不停。

“你不公平，我的小家伙，我本来就只会画蟒蛇的整体图与剖面图，别的什么都不会画。”

“咳，不碍事，”他说，“孩子们都看得懂。”

我按他的要求，用铅笔画了一个嘴套，递给他时，我因为有某种预感而心里难受，对他说：

“你一定有些什么计划没让我知道，还瞒着我呢……”

但他没有答理我这个话茬，对我说：

“你知道吗？我降落在地球上……到明天就是一周年啦……”

沉默片刻后，他又接着说：

“我降落的地点就在这附近……”

说完，他有点脸红不好意思。

这时，不知什么原因，我又感到一种不可名状的悲凉向我袭来，但我却想到另一个问题：

“这么说，八天之前那个早晨，你我相遇并不是偶然凑巧了，其实你独自一人在离地球人很远很远的地方游荡，最后你才回到你降落的地点来的，是吗？”

小王子不好意思，仍然面红耳赤。

我犹豫着加上一句：

“也许，是因为到了一周年？……”

小王子再一次脸红了。他从不正面回答别人的问话，但只要他一脸红，那就意味着他的答案是肯定的，不是吗？

我又对他说：“说实话吧，我是害怕……”

但他避开问题，对我说：

“现在你该去干活儿啦，该回到你的发动机那里去。我在这儿等着你，明天晚上你再来……”

听了他这话，我心里仍很不踏实。我想起了小王子与狐狸的离别。如果你跟对方有了交情，碰到现在这种情况，真忍不住要哭……





二十六


在那口水井旁，有一段坍塌的古老石墙。第二天晚上，我结束了自己的修理工作，如约回来找小王子，远远就看见他坐在墙头，两脚悬空垂着，我还听见他在和谁说话：

“你怎么不记得了？完全不是这个地方！”

肯定有谁在回答他，因为他又在解释说：

“是的，是的，正是这一天，可是，地点并不是在这儿……”

我继续朝那堵墙走去。我既听不见是谁在跟小王子对话，也看不见这个对话者。然而，小王子又开始向那个对话者说话：

“……当然啦，你可以在沙漠里看到我的足迹是从哪儿开始走的。你只要在那儿等着我就行了，今天夜里我一定会去的。”

我离墙只有二十米了，仍然没有看见小王子是在跟谁说话。但听得见他沉默一会儿之后又在向对方说：

“你的毒液不会厉害吧？你肯定不会使得我长时间受罪吧？”

我停下脚步，感到自己的心都要碎了，但我还是不了解小王子要干什么。

“现在你走吧，”他向对方说，“我要下来了！”



这时，我俯视那堵墙的墙根，着实吓了一跳，正是一条黄色的毒蛇。这种蛇奇毒无比，可在三十秒钟之内置人于死地。它正翘着头朝向小王子。我赶紧从口袋里掏出手枪，快步跑过去。但一听到我这边的响声，那蛇就悄悄从沙地里爬走，它宛如一道水流，在岩石缝里穿梭而过，发出轻微的金属般的声音，不急不慢，消逝而去。

我跑到墙跟前，正好用双臂接住我那宝贝王子，他脸色煞白，像白雪一般。

“你在搞什么名堂！竟然跟毒蛇交谈起来了！”

我替他解开围巾，那条金色围巾老是围在他脖子上，我又润湿了他的太阳穴，还给他喝了点水。这时，我不敢问他什么。他严肃地凝视着我，双臂搂着我的脖子。我感到他的心在拼命跳动，就像一只中弹后即将死亡的小鸟。他对我说：

“我很高兴你找到了你机器上所需的零件！你能驾飞机回家啦……”

“你怎么知道的？”

我正想告诉他，我是在多么绝望的情况下，终于完成了我的修理工作！

他也没有回答我刚才的问题，却添了一句：

“我也是……今天，我就要回家去啦……”

接着，他忧心忡忡地说：

“我回家的路，要比你远得多……也要困难得多……”

我明显感到，发生了某种不平常的大事，我像抱婴儿那样抱着他，然而，我感到他正垂直向一个万丈深渊掉下去，尽管我拼命要拉住他，却无济于事。

他的目光严肃认真，出神地遥望远方。

“我有你给的绵羊，还有关绵羊的箱子，还有绵羊的嘴套……”

他忧郁地微笑了。

我搂着他好久好久，觉得他的身子逐渐暖过来了：

“小家伙，你害怕了……”

当然，他是害怕了，但他温情地笑道：

“今天晚上，我会更加害怕……”

这时，一种无法弥补的痛失感猛然袭来，使得我全身发冷。我明白了，是那再也听不见的笑声让我受不了。这笑声对于我就像沙漠中的水井一般可贵……

“小家伙，我还想听见你的笑声……”

他却对我说：

“今天夜晚，正好是一年。我的星星将对准去年我降落的地方……”

“小家伙，你要讲关于蛇、关于约定、关于你那颗星星的事情，难道对我们不就意味着噩梦要来了吗……”

他没有答理我的问话，换个话题说：

“最为重要的东西，是肉眼看不到的……”

“当然啦！”

“对那朵花儿也是这样的。你如果爱上了一朵远在某个星球上的花儿，那么，你观望星空时就会感到甜美，因为天空中所有的星星就像是争奇斗艳的百花。”

“当然……”

“对于水也是这样。你给我喝的那水，像音乐一样动人，因为它使人想起辘轳与井绳发出的响声……你想起来了吧……它是多么甘甜呀。”

“当然。”

“今后，每到夜晚，你要看看星空啊。我的那颗星星太小了，我没法给你指出准确的方位。这样更好。我那颗星星，对你来说，就是群星中的一颗。因此，你就会更爱遥望星空啦……所有的星星都将是你的朋友。还有，我要送给你一件礼物……”

他又笑了。

“啊，小家伙，小家伙，我真爱听你的笑声。”

“这笑，正是我的礼物……这也正像水一样……”

“你的话是什么意思？”

“那些对星星情有独钟的人，也是形形色色、各不相同的。对于那些旅行者，星星可以指明方向，对于芸芸众生，星星只不过是微弱的光亮。对于那些学者，星星意味着一些研究课题，对于我碰见过的那个生意人，星星就是黄金。可是，对所有这些人来说，星星都是不会出声的，而对你来说，星星则完全不同……”

“你的话什么意思？”

“当你夜晚遥望星空时，因为我住在其中的一颗星星上，因为我在那上面会发出笑声，所以，对于你来说，这不就等于所有的星星都会笑了吗！你呀，你拥有天上那些会笑的星星！”

小王子继续笑着。

“还有，人总是要自我安慰的，当你得到慰藉时，你就会因为认识了我而感到高兴。你将永远是我的朋友。你会很想和我一同开心，一同笑，永远心心相印。有时，为了散散心，你会打开你的窗户……而你的朋友发现你望着星空发笑时，一定会感到惊讶。那时，你就可以对他们说：‘是的，星星永远使我欢笑！’他们听了一定会以为你神经出了毛病。那就算我跟你做了一次恶作剧吧……”

小王子仍在笑。

“那就好像我送给你的并不是星星，而是一串串会发出笑声的小铃铛……”

小王子仍在笑，接着，他又变得严肃起来，说：

“今天夜晚……你知道了……你就别来了……”

“我不会离开你的。”

“到那时，我的神情一定很难过……有点快要死去的样子。离别就是如此。你别来看这个场面，没有必要来……”

“我不会离开你的。”

这时，小王子显得忧心忡忡。

“我要你别来，也因考虑到那条蛇。不能让它咬你一口……蛇是很恶毒的，它高兴咬人就去咬人……”

“我不会离开你的。”我坚决地说。

小王子似乎想到什么，这使他放下心来，说：

“是呀，毒蛇先咬了别人，第二次再咬你时就没有毒啦……”

这天夜里，我未能看见他最后是如何上路的。因为他悄无声息地去了。

当我还在紧追他时，他迈着坚定的脚步勇往直前，只是对我说：



“哦！怎么你还在这儿……”

他拉了拉我的手，不安地对我说：

“这样你就不对了。你看我离去会难过的，我的神情会像死去那样，其实并不是真死……”

我，一言不发。

他又说：“你要知道，路程太远，我不能把自己的躯壳一并带上，它太重啦。”

我仍一言不发。

他又说：“我只不过是把旧躯壳弃之不顾罢了，旧躯壳是不会引起悲伤的……”

我一言不发。

他见劝我无效，有点泄气，但他仍在苦口婆心地劝导我：

“你知道，遗弃了躯壳也是一件好事，我仍然可以观赏星星呀。所有的星星都像是带着辘轳的水井，所有的星星都会供水给我喝……”

我一言不发。

“这个结果多么有意思啊！你会有五亿个小铃铛，我会有五亿口水井……”

他说不下去了，他哭了……

“我就在这里出发。请你让我独自一个人朝前走一步。”

他坐了下来，因为他感到害怕了。

但他还在说：

“你知道……我那朵花儿……我要对她尽责任呀！她那么娇弱无力，那么天真幼稚。她只有毫无用处的四根刺用来保卫自己，对付全世界……”



这时，我再也站不住了，便也坐了下来。他对我说了最后一句话：

“就是这些……我都讲完啦……”

他犹豫了一下，就站了起来，迈出一步。而我呢，我已全身瘫软，一动也不能动。

只见他脚踝边出现了一道黄色的闪光，没见有别的东西，闪光过后，他静止不动地待了片刻。他没有发出叫喊，而后缓缓倒了下去，就像一棵树倒了似的，没有发出任何声响，因为地面是软软的沙土。





二十七


现在，当然事情已经过去，过去六年之久了……我至今从未向任何人讲述过小王子这个故事。我后来从沙漠脱险后，同事们见我活着归来，都非常高兴。但从那以后，我长期郁郁不乐，我只告诉同事们说，是因为我太疲劳了……

现在，我多少感到了欣慰。这就是说……虽然我并不完全满意，但毕竟知道了小王子确实回到了他自己的星球，因为最后那个夜晚一过，第二天清晨，我并没有找到他的遗体。他的躯体并不重，回自己的家不至于有困难……现在，我夜里爱听群星的笑声已成习惯，它们真像五亿只铃铛……

但是，后来又发现了一件非同小可的事情，那就是我忘了给小王子画的嘴套上加上皮带，其后果是，他就会无法给他的绵羊戴牢嘴套啦。因此，我常常这样猜想：“他那颗星球上情况怎样，那只没戴上嘴套的绵羊，也许早就把那朵花儿吃掉了……”



有时，我又想：“肯定没事！小王子每天晚上都会把他那朵花儿用玻璃罩保护好，何况，他还会好好看管住自己的绵羊……”这么一想，我就心安了，天空中所有的星星也都温情脉脉地笑了。

有时，我又想：“小王子只要疏忽大意一次，后果就不堪设想啦！或是他哪天夜晚忘了把花儿罩好，或是那只绵羊夜里偷偷溜了出来……”一想到这里，星空中所有铃铛顷刻就变成了泪雨！……

这里存在着一个相当大的奥妙。对于你们这些与我一样也爱小王子的人来说，假如在某个说不清是何处的地方，有那么一只跟我们毫无关系的绵羊，把一朵玫瑰花吃掉了，那么，天地万物在我们眼里，就会全然不同了……

请你们仰望天空，请你们发问吧：绵羊有没有把那朵玫瑰花吃掉？你们只要关心这样的问题，你们看万物时就会有全然不同的感受……

然而，任何一个成年人永远都不会懂得这个问题有多么重要！

在我看来，这张图画的是世界上最美好但又最凄凉的景色。这景色与上一张图的景色完全一样，我再一次把它画出来，是为了使你看得更清楚。正是在这个地方，小王子降落在地球上，后来又从地球上消失。

请仔细观赏这一景致，为的是，如果有朝一日你们有机会去非洲旅行，来到了这一片沙漠时，就能够确凿无疑地认出这个地点。还有，如果你们恰好途经这里，那么我恳求你们千万别匆匆而过，请务必在星星下稍等片刻！万一有个男孩向你们走来，向你们微笑，而他又有一头金黄色的头发，还有一个习惯，那就是别人问他什么，他从不回答。总之，只要是这么一个小男孩，你们准会猜出他是谁了。如果你们真是碰上了他，那可要请你们想着我呀，请你快快写信告诉我他回来了，别让我总是沉浸在悲苦的思念之中……





TO LEON WERTH


I ask the indulgence of the children who may read this book for dedicating it to a grown-up. I have a serious reason：he is the best friend I have in the world.I have another reason：this grown-up understands everything, even books about children.I have a third reason：he lives in France where he is hungry and cold.He needs cheering up.If all these reasons are not enough, I will dedicate the book to the child from whom this grown-up grew.All grown-ups were once children—although few of them remember it.And so I correct my dedication：

Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest. It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal.Here is a copy of the drawing.

In the book it said：“Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it. After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion.”

I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle. And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing.My Drawing Number One.It looked like this：



I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.

But they answered：“Frighten?Why should anyone be frightened by a hat?”

My drawing was not a picture of a hat. It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant.But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing：I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly.They always need to have things explained.My Drawing Number Two looked like this：



The grown-ups'response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar. That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter.I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two.Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them.

So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes. I have flown a little over all parts of the world；and it is true that geography has been very useful to me.At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona.If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable.

In the course of this life, I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence. I have lived a great deal among grown-ups.I have seen them intimately, close at hand.And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them.

Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept. I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of trueunderstanding.But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say：

“That is a hat.”

Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars. I would bring myself down to his level.I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties.And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man.





Chapter 2


So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago. Something was broken in my engine.And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone.It was a question of life or death for me：I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week.

The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation. I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean.Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice.It said：

“If you please—draw me a sheep！”

“What！”

“Draw me a sheep！”

I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck. I blinked my eyes hard.I looked carefully all around me.And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness.Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him.But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model.



That, however, is not my fault. The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside.

Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment. Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region.And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue, or hunger, or thirst, or fear.Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation.When at last I was able to speak, I said to him：

“But—what are you doing here?”

And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence：

“If you please—draw me a sheep……”

When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey. Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen.But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap（a little crossly, too）that I did not know how to draw.He answered me：

“That doesn't matter. Draw me a sheep……”

But I had never drawn a sheep. So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often.It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside.And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with，“No, no, no！I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor. A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome.Where I live, everything is very small.What I need is a sheep.Draw me a sheep.”

So then I made a drawing.

He looked at it carefully, then he said：

“No. This sheep is already very sickly.Make me another.”

So I made another drawing.





My friend smiled gently and indulgently.

“You see yourself，”he said，“that this is not a sheep. This is a ram.It has horns.”

So then I did my drawing over once more.

But it was rejected too, just like the others.

“This one is too old. I want a sheep that will live a long time.”



By this time my patience was exhausted，because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart. So I tossed off this drawing.



And I threw out an explanation with it.

“This is only his box. The sheep you asked for is inside.”

I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge：

“That is exactly the way I wanted it！Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass?”

“Why?”

“Because where I live everything is very small……”

“There will surely be enough grass for him，”I said.“It is a very small sheep that I have given you.”

He bent his head over the drawing：

“Not so small that—Look！He has gone to sleep……”

And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince.





Chapter 3


It took me a long time to learn where he came from. The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him.It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me.

The first time he saw my airplane, for instance（I shall not draw my airplane；that would be much too complicated for me），he asked me：

“What is that object?”

“That is not an object. It flies.It is an airplane.It is my airplane.”

And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly.

He cried out, then：

“What！You dropped down from the sky?”

“Yes，”I answered, modestly.

“Oh！That is funny！”

And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much. I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously.

Then he added：

“So you, too, come from the sky！Which is your planet?”

At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence；and I demanded, abruptly：

“Do you come from another planet?”

But he did not reply. He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane：

“It is true that on that you can't have come from very far away……”

And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time. Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure.

You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the“other planets”. I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject.

“My little man, where do you come from?What is this‘where I live，'of which you speak?Where do you want to take your sheep?”

After a reflective silence he answered：

“The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house.”

“That is so. And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to.”

But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer：

“Tie him！What a queer idea！”

“But if you don't tie him，”I said，“he will wander off somewhere, and get lost.”

My friend broke into another peal of laughter：

“But where do you think he would go?”

“Anywhere. Straight ahead of him.”

Then the little prince said, earnestly：

“That doesn't matter. Where I live, everything is so small！”

And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added：

“Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far……”





Chapter 4


I had thus learned a second fact of great importance：this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house！



But that did not really surprise me much. I knew very well that in addition to the great planets—such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus—to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through thetelescope.When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number.He might call it, for example，“Asteroid 325.”

I have a serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612.



This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope. That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909.



On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration. But he was in Turkish costume, andso nobody would believe what he said.



Grown-ups are like that……

Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612，a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume. So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance.And this time everybody accepted his report.

If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways. When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters.They never say to you：“What does his voice sound like?What games does he love best?Does he collect butterflies?”Instead, they demand：“How old is he?How many brothers has he?How much does he weigh?How much money does his father make?”Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him.

If you were to say to the grown-ups：“I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof，”they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all. You would have to say to them：“I saw a house that cost$20，000.”Then they would exclaim：“Oh, what a pretty house that is！”

Just so, you might say to them：“The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep. If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists.”And what good would it do to tell them that?They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child.But if you said to them：“The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612，”then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions.

They are like that. One must not hold it against them.Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people.

But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference. I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales.I should have like to say：“Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than himself, and who had need of a sheep……”

To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story.

For I do not want anyone to read my book carelessly. I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories.Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep.If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him.To forget a friend is sad.Not every one has had a friend.And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures……

It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils. It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six.I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible.But I am not at all sure of success.One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject.I make some errors, too, in the little prince's height：in one place he is too tall and in another too short.And I feel somedoubts about the color of his costume.So I fumble along as best I can, not good, not bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling.

In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also. But that is something that will not be my fault.My friend never explained anything to me.He thought, perhaps, that I was like himself.But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes.Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups.I have had to grow old.





Chapter 5


As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, his journey. The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts.It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs.

This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it. For the little prince asked me abruptly—as if seized by a grave doubt—“It is true, isn't it, that sheep eat little bushes?”

“Yes, that is true.”

“Ah！I am glad！”

I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes. But the little prince added：



“Then it follows that they also eat baobabs?”

I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles；and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab.

The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh.

“We would have to put them one on top of the other，”he said.

But he made a wise comment：

“Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little.”

“That is strictly correct，”I said.“But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs?”

He answered me at once，“Oh, come, come！”，as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident. And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance.

Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived—as on all planets—good plants and bad plants. In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants.But seeds are invisible.They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until some one among them is seized with the desire to awaken.Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin—timidly at first—to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun.If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish.But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it.

Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince；and these were the seeds of the baobab. The soil of that planet was infested with them.A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late.It spreads over the entire planet.It bores clear through it with its roots.And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they will split it in pieces……



“It is a question of discipline，”the little prince said to me later on.“When you've finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care. You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rose-bushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth.It is very tedious work，”the little prince added，“but very easy.”

And one day he said to me：“You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is. That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day.Sometimes，”he added，“there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day.But when it is a matter of baobabs, that always means a catastrophe.I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man.He neglected three little bushes……”



So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet. I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist.But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve.“Children，”I say plainly，“watch out for the baobabs！”

My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it；and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing. The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me.

Perhaps you will ask me，“Why are there no other drawing in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs?”

The reply is simple. I have tried.But with the others I have not been successful.When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity.





Chapter 6




Oh, little prince！Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life……For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset. I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me：

“I am very fond of sunsets. Come, let us go look at a sunset now.”

“But we must wait，”I said.

“Wait?For what?”

“For the sunset. We must wait until it is time.”

At first you seemed to be very much surprised. And then you laughed to yourself.You said to me：

“I am always thinking that I am at home！”

Just so. Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States, the sun is setting over France.

If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon. Unfortunately, France is too far away for that.But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps.You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like……

“One day，”you said to me，“I saw the sunset forty-three times！”

And a little later you added：

“You know—one loves the sunet, when one is so sad……”

“Were you so sad, then?”I asked，“on the day of the forty-three sunsets?”

But the little prince made no reply.





Chapter 7


On the fifth day—again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep—the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me. Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded：

“A sheep—if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too?”

“A sheep，”I answered，“eats anything it finds in its reach.”

“Even flowers that have thorns?”

“Yes, even flowers that have thorns.”

“Then the thorns—what use are they?”

I did not know. At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine.I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious.And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst.

“The thorns—what use are they?”

The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it. As for me, I was upset over that bolt.And I answered with the first thing that came into my head：

“The thorns are of no use at all. Flowers have thorns just for spite！”

“Oh！”

There was a moment of complete silence. Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness：

“I don't believe you！Flowers are weak creatures. They are naïve.They reassure themselves as best they can.They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons……”

I did not answer. At that instant I was saying to myself：“If this boltstill won't turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer.”Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts.

“And you actually believe that the flowers—”

“Oh, no！”I cried.“No, no no！I don't believe anything. I answered you with the first thing that came into my head.Don't you see—I am very busy with matters of consequence！”

He stared at me, thunderstruck.

“Matters of consequence！”

He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine-grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly……

“You talk just like the grown-ups！”

That made me a little ashamed. But he went on, relentlessly：

“You mix everything up together……You confuse everything……”

He was really very angry. He tossed his golden curls in the breeze.

“I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman. He has never smelled a flower.He has never looked at a star.He has never loved anyone.He has never done anything in his life but add up figures.And all day he says over and over, just like you：‘I am busy with matters of consequence！'And that makes him swell up with pride.But he is not a man—he is a mushroom！”

“A what?”

“A mushroom！”

The little prince was now white with rage.

“The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years. For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same.And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them?Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important?Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman's sums?And if I know—I, myself—one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a singlebite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing—Oh！You think that is not important！”

His face turned from white to red as he continued：

“If some one loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars. He can say to himself，‘Somewhere, my flower is there……'But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened……And you think that is not important！”

He could not say anything more. His words were choked by sobbing.

The night had fallen. I had let my tools drop from my hands.Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death?On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted.I took him in my arms, and rocked him.I said to him：

“The flower that you love is not in danger. I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep.I will draw you a railing to put around your flower.I will—”

I did not know what to say to him. I felt awkward and blundering.I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more.

It is such a secret place, the land of tears.





Chapter 8


I soon learned to know this flower better. On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple.They had only one ring of petals；they took up no room at all；they were a trouble to nobody.One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away.But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up；and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet.It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab.

The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower. The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it.But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber.She chose her colours with the greatest care.She adjusted her petals one by one.She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies.It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear.Oh, yes！She was a coquettish creature！And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days.



Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself.

And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said：

“Ah！I am scarcely awake. I beg that you will excuse me.My petals are still all disarranged……”

But the little prince could not restrain his admiration：

“Oh！How beautiful you are！”

“Am I not?”the flower responded, sweetly.“And I was born at the same moment as the sun……”

The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest—but how moving—and exciting—she was！

“I think it is time for breakfast，”she added an instant later.“If you would have the kindness to think of my needs—”

And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling-can of fresh water. So, he tended the flower.



So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity—which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with. One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince：

“Let the tigers come with their claws！”

“There are no tigers on my planet，”the little prince objected.“And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds.”

“I am not a weed，”the flower replied, sweetly.

“Please excuse me……”

“I am not at all afraid of tigers，”she went on，“but I have a horror of drafts. I suppose you wouldn't have a screen for me?”



“A horror of drafts—that is bad luck, for a plant，”remarked the little prince, and added to himself，“This flower is a very complex creature……”

“At night I want you to put me under a glass globe. It is very cold where you live.In the place I came from—”

But she interrupted herself at that point. She had come in the form of a seed.She could not have known anything of any other worlds.Embarassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such a naïve untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong.

“The screen?”

“I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me……”

Then she forced her cough a little more so that he shoud suffer from remorse just the same.



So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her. He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy.

“I ought not to have listened to her，”he confided to me one day.“One never ought to listen to the flowers. One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance.Mine perfumed all my planet.But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace.This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity.”

And he continued his confidences：

“The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything！I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words. She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me.I ought never to have run away from her……I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little strategems.Flowers are so inconsistent！But I was too young to know how to love her……”





Chapter 9


I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds. On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order.He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes.He possessed two active volcanoes；and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning.He also had one volcano that was extinct.But, as he said，“One never knows！”So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too.If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions.Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney.

On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes. That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us.

The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs. He believed that he would never want to return.But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him.And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realised that he was very close to tears.

“Goodbye，”he said to the flower.

But she made no answer.

“Goodbye，”he said again.

The flower coughed. But it was not because she had a cold.

“I have been silly，”she said to him, at last.“I ask your forgiveness. Try to be happy……”

He was surprised by this absence of reproaches. He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air.He did not understand this quiet sweetness.

“Of course I love you，”the flower said to him.“It is my fault that you have not known it all the while. That is of no importance.But you—you have been just as foolish as I.Try to be happy……let the glass globe be.I don't want it any more.”

“But the wind—”

“My cold is not so bad as all that……the cool night air will do me good. I am a flower.”

“But the animals—”

“Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies. It seems that they are verybeautiful.And if not the butterflies—and the caterpillars—who will call upon me?You will be far away……as for the large animals—I am not at all afraid of any of them.I have my claws.”

And, naïvely, she showed her four thorns.Then she added：

“Don't linger like this. You have decided to go away.Now go！”

For she did not want him to see her crying. She was such a proud flower……





Chapter 10


He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325，326，327，328，329，and 330. He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge.

The first of them was inhabited by a king. Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic.

“Ah！Here is a subject，”exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming.

And the little prince asked himself：

“How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before?”

He did not know how the world is simplified for kings. To them, all men are subjects.

“Approach, so that I may see you better，”said the king, who felt consumingly proud of being at last a king over somebody.

The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down；but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe. So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned.

“It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king，”the monarch said to him.“I forbid you to do so.”

“I can't help it. I can't stop myself，”replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed.“I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep……”

“Ah, then，”the king said.“I order you to yawn. It is years since I have seen anyone yawning.Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity.Come, now！Yawn again！It is an order.”

“That frightens me……I cannot, any more……”murmured the little prince, now completely abashed.



“Hum！Hum！”replied the king.“Then I—I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes to—”

He sputtered a little, and seemed vexed. For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected.He tolerated no disobedience.He was an absolute monarch.But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable.

“If I ordered a general，”he would say, by way of example，“if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me, that would not be the fault of the general. It would be my fault.”

“May I sit down?”came now a timid inquiry from the little prince.

“I order you to do so，”the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle.

But the little prince was wondering……The planet was tiny. Over what could this king really rule?

“Sire，”he said to him，“I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question—”

“I order you to ask me a question，”the king hastened to assure him.

“Sire—over what do you rule?”

“Over everything，”said the king, with magnificent simplicity.

“Over everything?”

The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars.

“Over all that?”asked the little prince.

“Over all that，”the king answered.

For his rule was not only absolute：it was also universal.

“And the stars obey you?”

“Certainly they do，”the king said.“They obey instantly. I do not permit insubordination.”

Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at. If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair.And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor：

“I should like to see a sunset……do me that kindness……Order the sun to set……”

“If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong?”the king demanded.“The general, or myself?”

“You，”said the little prince firmly.

“Exactly. One much require from each one the duty which each one can perform，”the king went on.“Accepted authority rests first of all on reason.If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution.I have the right to require obediencebecause my orders are reasonable.”

“Then my sunset?”the little prince reminded him：for he never forgot a question once he had asked it.

“You shall have your sunset. I shall command it.But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favorable.”

“When will that be?”inquired the little prince.

“Hum！Hum！”replied the king；and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac.“Hum！Hum！That will be about—about—that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight. And you will see how well I am obeyed.”

The little prince yawned. He was regretting his lost sunset.And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored.

“I have nothing more to do here，”he said to the king.“So I shall set out on my way again.”

“Do not go，”said the king, who was very proud of having a subject.“Do not go. I will make you a Minister！”

“Minister of what?”

“Minster of—of Justice！”

“But there is nobody here to judge！”

“We do not know that，”the king said to him.“I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom. I am very old.There is no room here for a carriage.And it tires me to walk.”

“Oh, but I have looked already！”said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet. On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all……

“Then you shall judge yourself，”the king answered.“that is the most difficult thing of all. It is much more difficult to judge oneself than to judge others.If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom.”

“Yes，”said the little prince，“but I can judge myself anywhere. I do not need to live on this planet.

“Hum！Hum！”said the king.“I have good reason to believe thatsomewhere on my planet there is an old rat. I hear him at night.You can judge this old rat.From time to time you will condemn him to death.Thus his life will depend on your justice.But you will pardon him on each occasion；for he must be treated thriftily.He is the only one we have.”

“I，”replied the little prince，“do not like to condemn anyone to death. And now I think I will go on my way.”

“No，”said the king.

But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch.

“If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed，”he said，“he should be able to give me a reasonable order. He should be able, for example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute.It seems to me that conditions are favorable……”

As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment. Then, with a sigh, he took his leave.

“I made you my Ambassador，”the king called out, hastily.

He had a magnificent air of authority.

“The grown-ups are very strange，”the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey.





Chapter 11


The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man.

“Ah！Ah！I am about to receive a visit from an admirer！”he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming.

For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers.



“Good morning，”said the little prince.“That is a queer hat you are wearing.”

“It is a hat for salutes，”the conceited man replied.“It is to raise in salute when people acclaim me. Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way.”

“Yes?”said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about.

“Clap your hands, one against the other，”the conceited man now directed him.

The little prince clapped his hands. The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute.

“This is more entertaining than the visit to the king，”the little prince said to himself. And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other.The conceited man again raised his hat in salute.

After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game's monotony.

“And what should one do to make the hat come down?”he asked.

But the conceited man did not hear him. Conceited people never hear anything but praise.

“Do you really admire me very much?”he demanded of the little prince.

“What does that mean—‘admire'?”

“To admire mean that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet.”

“But you are the only man on your planet！”

“Do me this kindness. Admire me just the same.”

“I admire you，”said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly，“but what is there in that to interest you so much?”

And the little prince went away.

“The grown-ups are certainly very odd，”he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.





Chapter 12


The next planet was inhabited by a tippler. This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection.

“What are you doing there?”he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles.

“I am drinking，”replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air.

“Why are you drinking?”demanded the little prince.

“So that I may forget，”replied the tippler.

“Forget what?”inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him.

“Forget that I am ashamed，”the tippler confessed, hanging his head.

“Ashamed of what?”insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him.

“Ashamed of drinking！”The tipler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence.

And the little prince went away, puzzled.

“The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd，”he said to himself, as he continued on his journey.





Chapter 13


The fourth planet belonged to a businessman. This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince's arrival.

“Good morning，”the little prince said to him.“Your cigarette has gone out.”

“Three and two make five. Five and seven make twelve.Twelve and three make fifteen.Good morning.Fifteen and seven make twenty-two.Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight.I haven't time to light it again.Twenty-six and five make thirty-one.Phew！Then that makes five-hundred-and-one-million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one.”

“Five hundred million what?”asked the little prince.

“Eh?Are you still there?Five-hundred-and-one million—I can't stop……I have so much to do！I am concerned with matters of consequence. I don't amuse myself with balderdash.Two and five make seven……”



“Five-hundred-and-one million what?”repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it.

The businessman raised his head.

“During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I have been disturbed only three times. The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where.He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition.The second time, eleven years ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism.I don't get enough exercise.I have no time for loafing.The third time—well, this is it！I was saying, then, five-hundred-and-one millions—”

“Millions of what?”

The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question.

“Millions of those little objects，”he said，“which one sometimes sees in the sky.”

“Flies?”

“Oh, no. Little glittering objects.”

“Bees?”

“Oh, no. Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming.As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence.There is no time for idle dreaming in my life.”

“Ah！You mean the stars?”

“Yes, that's it. The stars.”

“And what do you do with five-hundred millions of stars?”

“Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one. I am concerned with matters of consequence：I am accurate.”

“And what do you do with these stars?”

“What do I do with them?”

“Yes.”

“Nothing. I own them.”

“You own the stars?”

“Yes.”

“But I have already seen a king who—”

“Kings do not own, they reign over. It is a very different matter.”

“And what good does it do you to own the stars?”

“It does me the good of making me rich.”

“And what good does it do you to be rich?”

“It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are ever discovered.”

“This man，”the little prince said to himself，“reasons a little like my poor tippler……”

Nevertheless, he still had some more questions.

“How is it possible for one to own the stars?”

“To whom do they belong?”the businessman retorted, peevishly.

“I don't know. To nobody.”

“Then they belong to me, because I was the first person to think of it.”

“Is that all that is necessary?”

“Certainly. When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours.When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours.When you get an idea before anyone else, you take out a patent on it：it is yours.So with me：I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them.”

“Yes, that is true，”said the little prince.“And what do you do with them?”

“I administer them，”replied the businessman.“I count them and recount them. It is difficult.But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence.”

The little prince was still not satisfied.

“If I owned a silk scarf，”he said，“I could put it around my neck and take it away with me. If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me.But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven……”

“No. But I can put them in the bank.”

“Whatever does that mean?”

“That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper. And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key.”

“And that is all?”

“That is enough，”said the businessman.

“It is entertaining，”thought the little prince.“It is rather poetic. But it is of no great consequence.”

On matters of consequence, the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grown-ups.

“I myself own a flower，”he continued his conversation with the businessman，“which I water every day. I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week（for I also clean out the one that is extinct；one never knows）.It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them.But you are of no use to the stars……”

The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer. And the little prince went away.

“The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary，”he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey.





Chapter 14


The fifth planet was very strange. It was the smallest of all.There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter.The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not one house.But he said to himself, nevertheless：

“It may well be that this man is absurd. But he is not so absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler.For at least his work has some meaning.When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower.When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep.That is a beautiful occupation.And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful.”

When he arrived on the planet, he respectfully saluted the lamplighter.

“Good morning. Why have you just put out your lamp?”

“Those are the orders，”replied the lamplighter.“Good morning.”

“What are the orders?”

“The orders are that I put out my lamp. Good evening.”

And he lighted his lamp again.

“But why have you just lighted it again?”

“Those are the orders，”replied the lamplighter.

“I do not understand，”said the little prince.

“There is nothing to understand，”said the lamplighter.“Orders are orders. Good morning.”

And he put out his lamp.

Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares.

“I follow a terrible profession. In the old days it was reasonable.I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again. I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep.”



“And the orders have been changed since that time?”

“The orders have not been changed，”said the lamplighter.“That is the tragedy！From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed！”

“Then what?”asked the little prince.

“Then—the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose. Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out！”

“That is very funny！A day lasts only one minute, here where you live！”

“It is not funny at all！”said the lamplighter.“While we have been talking together a month has gone by.”

“A month?”

“Yes, a month. Thirty minutes.Thirty days.Good evening.”

And he lighted his lamp again.

As the little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders. He remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling up his chair；and he wanted to help his friend.

“You know，”he said，“I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to……”

“I always want to rest，”said the lamplighter.

For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time.

The little prince went on with his explanation：

“Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it. To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly.When you want to rest, you will walk—and the day will last as long as you like.”

“That doesn't do me much good，”said the lamplighter.“The one thing I love in life is to sleep.”

“Then you're unlucky，”said the little prince.

“I am unlucky，”said the lamplighter.“Good morning.”

And he put out his lamp.

“That man，”said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey，“that man would be scorned by all the others：by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman. Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous.Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself.”

He breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again：

“That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend. But his planet is indeed too small.There is no room on it for two people……”

What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets！





Chapter 15


The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one. It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books.

“Oh, look！Here is an explorer！”he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming.

The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little. He had already traveled so much and so far！

“Where do you come from?”the old gentleman said to him.

“What is that big book?”said the little prince.“What are you doing?”

“I am a geographer，”the old gentleman said to him.

“What is a geographer?”asked the little prince.

“A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts.”

“That is very interesting，”said the little prince.“Here at last is a man who has a real profession！”And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer. It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen.

“Your planet is very beautiful，”he said.“Has it any oceans?”

“I couldn't tell you，”said the geographer.

“Ah！”The little prince was disappointed.“Has it any mountains?”

“I couldn't tell you，”said the geographer.

“And towns, and rivers, and deserts?”

“I couldn't tell you that, either.”

“But you are a geographer！”

“Exactly，”the geographer said.“But I am not an explorer. I haven't a single explorer on my planet.It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts.The geographer is much too important to go loafing about.He does not leave his desk.But he receives the explorers in his study.He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels.And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer's moral character.”

“Why is that?”

“Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer. So would an explorer who drank too much.”

“Why is that?”asked the little prince.

“Because intoxicated men see double. Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one.”

“I know some one，”said the little prince，“who would make a bad explorer.”

“That is possible. Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery.”

“One goes to see it?”

“No. That would be too complicated.But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs.For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it.”

The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement.

“But you—you come from far away！You are an explorer！You shall describe your planet to me！”

And, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil. The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil.One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink.

“Well?”said the geographer expectantly.

“Oh, where I live，”said the little prince，“it is not very interesting. It is all so small.I have three volcanoes.Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct.But one never knows.”

“One never knows，”said the geographer.

“I also have a flower.”

“We do not record flowers，”said the geographer.

“Why is that?The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet！”

“We do not record them，”said the geographer，“because they are ephemeral.”

“What does that mean—‘ephemeral'?”

“Geographies，”said the geographer，“are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence. They never become old-fashioned.It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position.It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters.We write of eternal things.”

“But extinct volcanoes may come to life again，”the little prince interrupted.“What does that mean—‘ephemeral'?”

“Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us，”said the geographer.“The thing that matters to us is the mountain. It does not change.”

“But what does that mean—‘ephemeral'?”repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it.

“It means，‘which is in danger of speedy disappearance.'”

“Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance?”

“Certainly it is.”

“My flower is ephemeral，”the little prince said to himself，“and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world. And I have left her on my planet, all alone！”

That was his first moment of regret. But he took courage once more.

“What place would you advise me to visit now?”he asked.

“The planet Earth，”replied the geographer.“It has a good reputation.”

And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower.





Chapter 16


So then the seventh planet was the Earth.

The Earth is not just an ordinary planet！One can count, there 111 kings（not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them），7000 geographers，900，000 businessmen，7，500，000 tipplers，311，000，000 conceited men—that is to say, about 2，000，000，000 grown-ups.

To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462，511 lamplighters for the street lamps.

Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle. The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera.First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia.Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep.Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings.After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies；then those of Africa and Europe, then those of South America；then those of South America；then those of North America.And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage.It would be magnificent.

Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole—only these two would live free from toil and care：they would be busy twice a year.





Chapter 17


When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth. I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters.And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it.Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth.If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide.All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet.

The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that. They imagine that they fill a great deal of space.They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs.You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations.They adore figures, and that will please them.But do not waste your time on this extra task.It is unnecessary.You have, I know, confidence in me.

When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people. He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand.

“Good evening，”said the little prince courteously.

“Good evening，”said the snake.

“What planet is this on which I have come down?”asked the little prince.

“This is the Earth；this is Africa，”the snake answered.

“Ah！Then there are no people on the Earth?”

“This is the desert. There are no people in the desert.The Earth islarge，”said the snake.



The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky.

“I wonder，”he said，“whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again……Look at my planet. It is right there above us.But how far away it is！”

“It is beautiful，”the snake said.“What has brought you here?”

“I have been having some trouble with a flower，”said the little prince.

“Ah！”said the snake.

And they were both silent.

“Where are the men?”the little prince at last took up the conversation again.“It is a little lonely in the desert……”

“It is also lonely among men，”the snake said.

The little prince gazed at him for a long time.

“You are a funny animal，”he said at last.“You are no thicker than a finger……”

“But I am more powerful than the finger of a king，”said the snake.

The little prince smiled.

“You are not very powerful. You haven't even any feet.You cannot even travel……”

“I can carry you farther than any ship could take you，”said the snake.

He twined himself around the little prince's ankle, like a golden bracelet.

“Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came，”the snake spoke again.“But you are innocent and true, and you come from a star……”

The little prince made no reply.

“You move me to pity—you are so weak on this Earth made of granite，”the snake said.“I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet. I can—”

“Oh！I understand you very well，”said the little prince.“But why do you always speak in riddles?”

“I solve them all，”said the snake.

And they were both silent.





Chapter 18


The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower. It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all.

“Good morning，”said the little prince.

“Good morning，”said the flower.

“Where are the men?”the little prince asked, politely.

The flower had once seen a caravan passing.

“Men?”she echoed.“I think there are six or seven of them in existence. I saw them, several years ago.But one never knows where to find them.The wind blows them away.They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult.”



“Goodbye，”said the little prince.

“Goodbye，”said the flower.





Chapter 19


After that, the little prince climbed a high mountain. The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees.And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool.“From a mountain as high as this one，”he said to himself，“I shall be able to see the whole planet at one glance, and all the people……”



But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles.

“Good morning，”he said courteously.

“Good morning—Good morning—Good morning，”answered the echo.

“Who are you?”said the little prince.

“Who are you—Who are you—Who are you?”answered the echo.

“Be my friends. I am all alone，”he said.

“I am all alone—all alone—all alone，”answered the echo.

“What a queer planet！”he thought.“It is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether harsh and forbidding. And the people have no imagination.They repeat whatever one says to them……On my planet I had a flower；she always was the first to speak……”





Chapter 20


But it happened that after walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little prince at last came upon a road. And all roads lead to the abodes of men.

“Good morning，”he said.

He was standing before a garden, all abloom with roses.

“Good morning，”said the roses.

The little prince gazed at them. They all looked like his flower.

“Who are you?”he demanded, thunderstruck.

“We are roses，”the roses said.



And he was overcome with sadness. His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in all the universe.And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden！

“She would be very much annoyed，”he said to himself，“if she should see that……she would cough most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at. And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life—for if I did not do that, to humble myself also, she would really allow herself to die……”

Then he went on with his reflections：“I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in all the world；and all I had was a common rose. A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees—and one of them perhaps extinct forever……that doesn't make me a very great prince……”

And he lay down in the grass and cried.





Chapter 21


It was then that the fox appeared.

“Good morning，”said the fox.

“Good morning，”the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing.

“I am right here，”the voice said，“under the apple tree.”

“Who are you?”asked the little prince, and added，“You are very pretty to look at.”

“I am a fox，”said the fox.

“Come and play with me，”proposed the little prince.“I am so unhappy.”

“I cannot play with you，”the fox said.“I am not tamed.”

“Ah！Please excuse me，”said the little prince.

But, after some thought, he added：

“What does that mean—‘tame'?”

“You do not live here，”said the fox.“What is it that you are looking for?”

“I am looking for men，”said the little prince.“What does that mean—‘tame'?”

“Men，”said the fox.“They have guns, and they hunt. It is very disturbing.They also raise chickens.These are their only interests.Are you looking for chickens?”

“No，”said the little prince.“I am looking for friends. What does that mean—‘tame'?”

“It is an act too often neglected，”said the fox.“It means to establish ties.”

“‘To establish ties'?”



“Just that，”said the fox.“To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys. And I have no need of you.And you, on your part, have no need of me.To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes.But if you tame me, then we shall need each other.To me, you will be unique in all the world.To you, I shall be unique in all the world……”

“I am beginning to understand，”said the little prince.“There is a flower……I think that she has tamed me……”

“It is possible，”said the fox.“On the Earth one sees all sorts of things.”

“Oh, but this is not on the Earth！”said the little prince.

The fox seemed perplexed, and very curious.

“On another planet?”

“Yes.”

“Are there hunters on this planet?”

“No.”

“Ah, that is interesting！Are there chickens?”

“No.”

“Nothing is perfect，”sighed the fox.

But he came back to his idea.

“My life is very monotonous，”the fox said.“I hunt chickens；men hunt me. All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike.And, in consequence, I am a little bored.But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life.I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others.Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground.Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow.And then look：you see the grain-fields down yonder?I do not eat bread.Wheat is of no use to me.The wheat fields have nothing to say to me.And that is sad.But you have hair that is the colour of gold.Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me！The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you.And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat……”



The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time.

“Please—tame me！”he said.

“I want to, very much，”the little prince replied.“But I have not much time. I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand.”

“One only understands the things that one tames，”said the fox.“Men have no more time to understand anything. They buy things all ready made at the shops.But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more.If you want a friend, tame me……”

“What must I do, to tame you?”asked the little prince.

“You must be very patient，”replied the fox.“First you will sit down at a little distance from me—like that—in the grass. I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing.Words are the source of misunderstandings.But you will sit a little closer to me, every day……”

The next day the little prince came back.

“It would have been better to come back at the same hour，”said the fox.“If, for example, you come at four o'clock in the afternoon, then at three o'clock I shall begin to be happy. I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances.At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about.I shall show you how happy I am！But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you……One must observe the proper rites……”

“What is a rite?”asked the little prince.

“Those also are actions too often neglected，”said the fox.“They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours. There is a rite, for example, among my hunters.Every Thursday they dance with the village girls.So Thursday is a wonderful day for me！I can take a walk as far as the vineyards.But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all.”

So the little prince tamed the fox. And when the hour of his departure drew near—

“Ah，”said the fox，“I shall cry.”

“It is your own fault，”said the little prince.“I never wished you any sort of harm；but you wanted me to tame you……”

“Yes, that is so，”said the fox.

“But now you are going to cry！”said the little prince.

“Yes, that is so，”said the fox.

“Then it has done you no good at all！”

“It has done me good，”said the fox，“because of the color of the wheat fields.”And then he added：

“Go and look again at the roses. You will understand now that yours is unique in all the world.Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret.”

The little prince went away, to look again at the roses.

“You are not at all like my rose，”he said.“As yet you are nothing. No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one.You are like my fox when I first knew him.He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes.But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in all the world.”

And the roses were very much embarassed.

“You are beautiful, but you are empty，”he went on.“One could not die for you. To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you—the rose that belongs to me.But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of you other roses：because it is she that I have watered；because it is she that I have put under the glass globe；because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen；because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars（except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies）；because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or ever sometimes when she said nothing.Because she is my rose.

And he went back to meet the fox.

“Goodbye，”he said.

“Goodbye，”said the fox.“And now here is my secret, a very simple secret：It is only with the heart that one can see rightly；what is essential is invisible to the eye.”

“What is essential is invisible to the eye，”the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.

“It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose soimportant.”

“It is the time I have wasted for my rose—”said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember.

“Men have forgotten this truth，”said the fox.“But you must not forget it. You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed.You are responsible for your rose……”

“I am responsible for my rose，”the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember.





Chapter 22


“Good morning，”said the little prince.

“Good morning，”said the railway switchman.

“What do you do here?”the little prince asked.

“I sort out travelers, in bundles of a thousand，”said the switchman.“I send off the trains that carry them；now to the right, now to the left.”

And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman's cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder.

“They are in a great hurry，”said the little prince.“What are they looking for?”

“Not even the locomotive engineer knows that，”said the switchman.

And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction.

“Are they coming back already?”demanded the little prince.

“These are not the same ones，”said the switchman.“It is an exchange.”

“Were they not satisfied where they were?”asked the little prince.

“No one is ever satisfied where he is，”said the switchman.

And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express.

“Are they pursuing the first travelers?”demanded the little prince.

“They are pursuing nothing at all，”said the switchman.“They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes.”

“Only the children know what they are looking for，”said the little prince.“They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them；and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry……”

“They are lucky，”the switchman said.





Chapter 23


“Good morning，”said the little prince.

“Good morning，”said the merchant.

This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst. You need only swallow one pill a week, and you would feel no need of anything to drink.

“Why are you selling those?”asked the little prince.

“Because they save a tremendous amount of time，”said the merchant.“Computations have been made by experts. With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week.”

“And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes?”

“Anything you like……”

“As for me，”said the little prince to himself，“if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water.”





Chapter 24


It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drop of my water supply.

“Ah，”I said to the little prince，“these memories of yours are very charming；but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane；I have nothing more to drink；and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water！”

“My friend the fox—”the little prince said to me.

“My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox！”

“Why not?”

“Because I am about to die of thirst……”

He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me：

“It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die. I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend……”

“He has no way of guessing the danger，”I said to myself.“He has never been either hungry or thirsty. A little sunshine is all he needs……”

But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought：

“I am thirsty, too. Let us look for a well……”

I made a gesture of weariness. It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert.But nevertheless we started walking.

When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out. Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream.The little prince's last words came reeling back into my memory.

“Then you are thirsty, too?”I demanded.

But he did not reply to my question. He merely said to me：

“Water may also be good for the heart……”

I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing. I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him.

He was tired. He sat down.I sat down beside him.And, after a little silence, he spoke again：

“The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen.”

I replied，“Yes, that is so.”And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight.

“The desert is beautiful，”the little prince added.

And that was true. I have always loved the desert.One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing.Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams……

“What makes the desert beautiful，”said the little prince，“is that somewhere it hides a well……”

I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands. When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there.To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it；perhaps no one had ever even looked for it.But it cast an enchantment over that house.My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart……

“Yes，”I said to the little prince.“The house, the stars, the desert—what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible！”

“I am glad，”he said，“that you agree with my fox.”

As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more. I felt deeply moved, and stirred.It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure.It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth.In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself：“What I see here is nothing but a shell.What is the mostimportant is invisible……”

As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again：“What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower—the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep……”And I felt him to be more fragile still. I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind……

And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak.





Chapter 25


“Men，”said the little prince，“set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for. Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round……”

And he added：

“It is not worth the trouble……”

The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara. The wells of the Sahara were mere holes dug in the sand.This one was like a well in a village.But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming……

“It is strange，”I said to the little prince.“Everything is ready for use：the pulley, the bucket, the rope……”

He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working. And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten.

“Do you hear?”said the little prince.“We have wakened the well, and it is singing……”

I did not want him to tire himself with the rope.

“Leave it to me，”I said.“It is too heavy for you.”

I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there—happy, tired as I was, over my achievement. The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water.

“I am thirsty for this water，”said the little prince.“Give me some of it to drink……”

And I understood what he had been looking for.

I raised the bucket to his lips. He drank, his eyes closed.It was as sweet as some special festival treat. This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment.Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms.It was good for the heart, like a present.When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received.



“The men where you live，”said the little prince，“raise five thousand roses in the same garden—and they do not find in it what they are looking for.”

“They do not find it，”I replied.

“And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water.”

“Yes, that is true，”I said.

And the little prince added：

“But the eyes are blind. One must look with the heart……”

I had drunk the water. I breathed easily.At sunrise the sand was the color of honey.And that honey color was making me happy, too.What brought me, then, this sense of grief?

“You must keep your promise，”said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more.

“What promise?”

“You know—a muzzle for my sheep……I am responsible for this flower……”

I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket. The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said：

“Your baobabs—they look a little like cabbages.”

“Oh！”

I had been so proud of my baobabs！

“Your fox—his ears look a little like horns；and they are too long.”

And he laughed again.

“You are not fair, little prince，”I said.“I don't know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors fromthe inside.”

“Oh, that will be all right，”he said，“children understand.”

So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle. And as I gave it to him, my heart was torn.

“You have plans that I do not know about，”I said.

But he did not answer me. He said to me, instead：

“You know—my descent to the earth……Tomorrow will be its anniversary.”

Then, after a silence, he went on：

“I came down very near here.”

And he flushed.

And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow. One question, however, occurred to me：

“Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you—a week ago—you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region?You were on the your back to the place where you landed?”

The little prince flushed again.

And I added, with some hesitancy：

“Perhaps it was because of the anniversary?”

The little prince flushed once more. He never answered questions—but when one flushes does that not mean“Yes”?

“Ah，”I said to him，“I am a little frightened—”

But he interrupted me.

“Now you must work. You must return to your engine.I will be waiting for you here.Come back tomorrow evening……”

But I was not reassured. I remembered the fox.One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed……





Chapter 26


Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall. When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little prince sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling.And I heard him say：

“Then you don't remember. This is not the exact spot.”

Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it：

“Yes, yes！It is the right day, but this is not the place.”



I continued my walk toward the wall. At no time did I see or hear anyone.The little prince, however, replied once again：

“—Exactly. You will see where my track begins, in the sand.You have nothing to do but wait for me there.I shall be there tonight.”

I was only twenty metres from the wall, and I still saw nothing.

After a silence the little prince spoke again：

“You have good poison?You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long?”

I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder；but still I did not understand.

“Now go away，”said the little prince.“I want to get down from the wall.”

I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall—and I leaped into the air. There before me, facing the little prince, was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end.Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back.But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones.

I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms；his face was white as snow.

“What does this mean?”I demanded.“Why are you talking with snakes?”

I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore. I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink.And now I did not dare ask him any more questions.He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck.I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone's rifle……

“I am glad that you have found what was the matter with your engine，”he said.“Now you can go back home—”

“How do you know about that?”

I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope.

He made no answer to my question, but he added：

“I, too, am going back home today……”

Then, sadly—

“It is much farther……it is much more difficult……”

I realised clearly that something extraordinary was happening. I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child；and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him……

His look was very serious, like some one lost far away.

“I have your sheep. And I have the sheep's box.And I have the muzzle……”

And he gave me a sad smile.

I waited a long time. I could see that he was reviving little by little.

“Dear little man，”I said to him，“you are afraid……”

He was afraid, there was no doubt about that. But he laughed lightly.

“I shall be much more afraid this evening……”

Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable. And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more.For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert.

“Little man，”I said，“I want to hear you laugh again.”

But he said to me：

“Tonight, it will be a year……my star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago……”

“Little man，”I said，“tell me that it is only a bad dream—this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star……”

But he did not answer my plea. He said to me, instead：“The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen……”

“Yes, I know……”

“It is just as it is with the flower. If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night.All the stars are abloom with flowers……”

“Yes, I know……”

“It is just as it is with the water. Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music.You remember—how good it was.”

“Yes, I know……”

“And at night you will look up at the stars. Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found.It is better, like that.My star will just be one of the stars, for you.And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens……they will all be your friends.And, besides, I am going to make you a present……”

He laughed again.

“Ah, little prince, dear little prince！I love to hear that laughter！”

“That is my present. Just that.It will be as it was when we drank the water……”

“What are you trying to say?”

“All men have the stars，”he answered，“but they are not the same things for different people. For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides.For others they are no more than little lights in the sky.For others, who are scholars, they are problems.For businessmen they are wealth.But all these stars are silent.You—you alone—will have the stars as no one else has them—”

“What are you trying to say?”

“In one of the stars I shall be living. In one of them I shall be laughing.And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night……you—only you—will have stars that can laugh！”

And he laughed again.

“And when your sorrow is comforted（time soothes all sorrows）you will be content that you have known me. You will always be my friend.You will want to laugh with me.And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure……and your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky！Then you will say to them，‘Yes, the stars always make me laugh！'And they will think you are crazy.It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you……”

And he laughed again.

“It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh……”

And he laughed again. Then he quickly became serious：

“Tonight—you know……do not come，”said the little prince.

“I shall not leave you，”I said.

“I shall look as if I were suffering. I shall look a little as if I were dying.It is like that.Do not come to see that.It is not worth the trouble……”

“I shall not leave you.”

But he was worried.

“I tell you—it is also because of the snake. He must not bite you.Snakes—they are malicious creatures.This one might bite you just for fun……”

“I shall not leave you.”

But a thought came to reassure him：

“It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite.”



That night I did not see him set out on his way. He got away from me without making a sound.When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step.He said to memerely：

“Ah！You are there……”

And he took me by the hand. But he was still worrying.

“It was wrong of you to come. You will suffer.I shall look as if I were dead；and that will not be true……”

I said nothing.

“You understand……it is too far. I cannot carry this body with me.It is too heavy.”

I said nothing.

“But it will be like an old abandoned shell. There is nothing sad about old shells……”

I said nothing.

He was a little discouraged. But he made one more effort：

“You know, it will be very nice. I, too, shall look at the stars.All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley.All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink……”



I said nothing.

“That will be so amusing！You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water……”

And he too said nothing more, becuase he was crying……

“Here it is. Let me go on by myself.”

And he sat down, because he was afraid. Then he said, again：

“You know—my flower……I am responsible for her. And she is so weak！She is so naïve！She has four thorns, of no use at all, to protect herself against all the world……”

I also sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer.

“There now—that is all……”

He still hesitated a little；then he got up. He took one step.I could not move.



There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle. He remained motionless for an instant.He did not cry out.He fell as gently as a tree falls.There was not even any sound, because of the sand.





Chapter 27


And now six years have already gone by……

I have never yet told this story. The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive.I was sad, but I told them：“I am tired.”

Now my sorrow is comforted a little. That is to say—not entirely.But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak.It was not such a heavy body……and at night I love to listen to the stars.It is like five hundred million little bells……

But there is one extraordinary thing……when I drew the muzzle for the little prince, I forgot to add the leather strap to it. He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep.So now I keep wondering：what is happening on his planet?Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower……

At one time I say to myself：“Surely not！The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully……”Then I am happy. And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars.

But at another time I say to myself：“At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough！On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night……”And then the little bells are changed to tears……

Here, then, is a great mystery. For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where, a sheep that we never saw has—yes or no?—eaten a rose……

Look up at the sky. Ask yourselves：is it yes or no?Has the sheep eaten the flower?And you will see how everything changes……

And no grown-up will ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance！

This is, to me, the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world. It is the same as that on the preceding page, but I have drawn it again to impress it on your memory.It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth, and disappeared.

Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognise it in case you travel some day to the African desert. And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on.Wait for a time, exactly under the star.Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair, and who refuses to answer questions, you will know who he is.If this should happen, please comfort me.Send me word that he has come back.
