长腿叔叔

译者序　完美的童话


直到译完这本书的结尾，我才发现原来《长腿叔叔》是一部出其不意的作品，这样令人惊喜的结局完美得像一出童话，或许，它本身就是一部成人童话吧！

这本书的作者简·韦伯斯特（1876—1916）之所以能够写出这样一本感情丰富而又诙谐有趣的书，不知道是不是部分得益于家族的遗传——她是美国知名作家马克·吐温的侄孙女，《长腿叔叔》是她最广为人知的一部作品。

简·韦伯斯特对慈善事业的参与构筑了这部小说的框架，作者在对穷苦人民的访视中，坚定了逆境中成长的孩子能成就大事业的信念，也正是这种信念激发了《长腿叔叔》的问世，也正因为亲眼看到了这样的生活，有过感同身受的体验，作者才能将孤独、骄傲、勤奋的小孤儿茱迪的各种微妙的心理刻画得淋漓尽致。

小茱迪活泼、俏皮、倔强的个性在给长腿叔叔的信中无时无刻不表现出来，她的任性、骄傲、刻苦、知足也在笔墨间随意流洒，我们在她身上读到了小女生特有的虚荣，也读到了足以克服虚荣的隐忍，然后顺其自然地随着她走进爱情，或许她的爱情和任何我们知晓的爱情一样盲目得可爱。

小茱迪和长腿叔叔似乎具有“过度幽默”的特质，这着实让死板的人们有点吃不消，让无关痛痒的人们好气又好笑。因为在这个世界上，说真话是需要天真和勇气的！所以，小茱迪这个人物才会显得鲜明生动、可爱真实，就像笑容甜美的邻家女孩，让人忍不住要去宠爱她。

小茱迪这样一个可爱的小姑娘，在这本书的字里行间都充分地展现出她的智慧和灵气。一一列举并且解释这些闪光点实在是很困难。那么就这样吧，请你们沿着我翻译时走过的同一道路走下去——先到孤儿院去看看她，感受一下孤儿院公式化的冷漠，小茱迪的零乱不安与繁忙，然后随着她睁大眼睛满怀好奇地走进校园，和她一起努力地从生活、书本中汲取知识，亲眼看着她茁壮地成长，看着她渐渐摆脱孤儿院给她带来的忧伤、自卑、压抑，乐观地面对一切挫折，成为一个善良的人吧。

忧郁星期三

杰瑞莎·艾伯特写给长腿叔叔史密斯的信

“Blue Wednesday”

The Letters of Miss Jerusha Abbott to Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith







忧郁星期三


每个月的第一个礼拜三都糟糕透顶——是满怀恐惧地等待，鼓足勇气地承受，而后再急急忙忙地忘掉的一天。每层楼的地板都得一尘不染，每把椅子都必须整洁无瑕，每张床都要铺得一丝不皱。要给九十七个四处乱爬的小孤儿梳洗干净，套上刚刚浆洗过的花格布衬衫，一个个地提醒他们注意自己的仪态，还要教他们学会不管理事什么时候问话，要回答“是的，先生”或“不，先生”。

这个时候真是令人痛苦。可怜的杰瑞莎·艾伯特作为最年长的孤儿，这一天对她来说就更倒霉了。像往常一样，这个特殊的星期三总算挨到了尾声，杰瑞莎终于从厨房逃了出来，她刚在这里为客人们做了三明治，又跑到楼上去完成她的日常任务。她负责的是第六室，那里有十一个四岁到七岁不等的小不点儿，放了十一张排成一行的小床，杰瑞莎好不容易才把他们集合起来，帮他们整理好皱巴巴的上衣，擦了擦鼻涕，让他们心甘情愿地排成整齐的队伍，而后领着他们去餐室，吃面包，喝牛奶，还有李子布丁，享受半个小时的快乐时光。

做完这些后，她跌坐在靠窗台的椅子上，将涨得生疼的太阳穴抵住冰冷的玻璃。她从早上五点钟开始就手脚不停地忙，还时不时地被神经质的女监事责骂、催促，私底下的李佩特太太可并不会一直保持她面对理事及女宾时平静、庄重的样子。杰瑞莎的目光越过一片上了冻的开阔草地，越过孤儿院高高的铁栏杆，落在远处起伏的山峦、山间散落着的农庄，以及光秃秃的树丛中露出的村庄尖屋顶上。

这一天结束了——就她所知，相当顺利。理事和巡查委员会成员照例巡视了孤儿院，读完了报告，喝完了茶，现在正急匆匆地赶回家享受令人欢欣的炉火，至少要到下个月才能想起他们照管的这些折磨人的小鬼。杰瑞莎探着身子，好奇并带着一丝憧憬地望着那成队的马车、小汽车驶出孤儿院的大门。她幻想自己跟随着一辆又一辆车，去了那些沿着山腰星罗棋布的大房子前。她看到自己穿着皮大衣，戴着插了羽毛的天鹅绒帽子，靠在椅子后背上漫不经心地对车夫说：“回家。”然而到了门槛上，家的画面便模糊不清了。

杰瑞莎喜欢幻想——李佩特太太告诉她说，幻想，要是不小心的话会惹麻烦——但是不管她的想象力有多么丰富，都无法带领她跨过门廊，走进那些她想去的屋子里。可怜的、富有冒险精神的小杰瑞莎，在她有生的十七年间，从未跨入一扇平常的家门，她根本就想象不出那些没有孤儿烦扰的人怎样生活。

杰——瑞——莎　艾——伯——特

办公室有人找

照我看

你还是快点为妙！

汤米·迪伦参加了唱诗班，从楼梯到走廊他一路都在唱歌，靠近第六室的时候，他的歌声越发嘹亮起来。杰瑞莎从窗口收回了目光，不得不再次面对生活的烦恼。

“谁找我？”她打断了汤米的歌唱，急切地问。

办公室里的李佩特太太

我想她快疯啦

阿——门！

汤米拖长了声音唱着，他的语调并没有恶意。甚至连心肠最硬的小孤儿也会对犯了错被叫到办公室的姐姐满怀同情，因为她得到办公室去面对招人讨厌的老太太。汤米还是蛮喜欢杰瑞莎的，虽然她有时使劲儿地拽着他的胳膊，或是差点要把他的鼻子给擦下来。

杰瑞莎没有再说话，走了，只是额头多了两条皱纹。她想知道哪里出问题了，是三明治不够薄吗？是果仁饼里有壳吗？还是哪位女宾发现苏茜·霍森的长袜上有个洞呢？是不是——哦，糟糕！——第六室那些天真无邪的小宝贝跟理事顶嘴了？

低矮的长廊上灯还没有亮，她下楼的时候，最后一位理事站在那儿，正准备离开，他站在通向院外的门口，杰瑞莎对他只有个一闪即逝的印象——他很高。他正朝着一辆停在弯道上的汽车挥手，车子启动开过来时，耀眼的光芒把他的影子投在了室内的墙壁上。影子奇形怪状的：拉长的四肢沿着地板奔跑，蹿上了走廊墙壁，就像人们常常说的“长腿叔叔”——那是一种摇摇晃晃的大蜘蛛。

杰瑞莎紧锁的眉头顿时松开了，发出了一阵欢快的笑声。她性格开朗，一点点小事都能把她逗乐。谁能从哪个理事的难堪之中找到点乐子，自然是意外的惊喜啦！她继续往办公室走去，这个小小的插曲让她非常开心，面对着李佩特太太时也是笑逐颜开。出乎意料的是，杰瑞莎发现李佩特太太也相当和蔼，即便她没有笑容。她的表情愉快得像在接待来访的客人。

“坐下，杰瑞莎，我有话要对你说。”

杰瑞莎坐在了离她最近的椅子上，屏住了呼吸等待着。一辆汽车从窗外闪过，李佩特太太的目光跟在它后头。

“你注意到刚刚走的这位先生了吗？”

“我看到了他的背影。”

“他是我们最富有的理事之一，给救济院捐赠了大笔的款项来支持我们。我没有权利说出他的名字，他特别要求不要说出他的名字。”

杰瑞莎的眼睛微微睁大，她不习惯被召到办公室里来和监事谈论理事们的古怪脾气。

“这位先生一直很关注我们的几个男孩子。你记得查理·本顿和亨利·弗瑞兹吧？他们两个都是——这位，呃……理事先生送去大学的，他们两个人都很用功，都以良好的成绩回报了这位先生的慷慨资助。别的回报这位先生并不想要。迄今为止，他的善心仅限于男孩子，我从来没能让他对这里的女孩子有一点点的兴趣，不管是多么值得的姑娘。我可以告诉你，他不喜欢女孩子。”

“是的。太太。”杰瑞莎讷讷地回答，因为此时，这样的回答似乎是李佩特太太希望听到的。

“今天在例会上，有人提到了你的前途问题。”

李佩特太太略微停顿了片刻，而后又慢条斯理地说了下去，这让她的听众的神经骤然紧绷了起来。

“你也知道，通常，孩子们十六岁以后就不能留在这里了，但你是个例外。你十四岁就完成我们的课程，成绩不错——但也不尽然，得说你的操行并非一向优良——我们才让你继续在村里的中学读书。如今你就要毕业了，当然，院里不能再负担你的费用。即便如此，你也比大部分孩子多读了两年书。”

李佩特太太全然不提在这两年里，杰瑞莎为了自己的食宿卖力地工作。救济院一直是第一位的，她的学习排在第二位，一旦遇到像今天这样的日子，杰瑞莎就得被留下来打扫卫生。

“我刚才说了，有人提出你的前途问题，讨论了你的表现——一场彻底的讨论。”

李佩特太太用谴责的目光望着这个“被告席上的小囚犯”，而“犯人”也配合地露出有罪的神情。因为这种表情是李佩特太太希望看到的，并不是因为她自己记起了自己有什么让人侧目的污点记录。

“自然，像你这种情况，通常安排一个工作就可以了。但是你在学校的时候有些学科学得很不错，英文甚至可以说非常优秀。普里查德小姐是我们巡查委员会的委员，也是学校理事会的成员，她曾经和你的语文老师谈过话，她说了一大通你的好话。她还大声地朗读了你写的一篇作文，叫作《忧郁星期三》。”

这下杰瑞莎可真的知罪了。

“你嘲笑这个为你做了这么多事情的救济院，这让我感觉你丝毫不知道感恩。要是你没有这么幽默的话，我怀疑会不会有人原谅你。然而，幸运的是，那位先生，刚刚走掉的那位理事先生表现出了极大的幽默感，就因为那篇无礼的作文，他决定送你去上大学。”

“上大学？”杰瑞莎瞪大了双眼。

李佩特太太点了点头。

“他留下来和我谈了条件，条件不同寻常。我觉得这位先生相当古怪。他认为你很有天分，他想把你培养成作家。”

“作家？”杰瑞莎的脑袋一下就蒙了，只能重复李佩特太太的话。

“这只是他的愿望，能否成功将来自然会知道的。他会给你提供充裕的零花钱，对一个从来没管过钱的女孩子来说，几乎是过于慷慨了。不过他把事情的细节都计划好了，我感觉似乎不能再提建议了。今年夏天你还是在这里，普里查德小姐慷慨地答应帮你添置衣服。至于你的膳食费以及学费，直接由那位先生付给校方。大学的四年里，你每个月会有三十五美元的零用钱，这足以使你和其他学生的情况相当。这位先生的私人秘书每个月会把钱寄给你，而你每个月收到钱以后要写信给他。并不是要你感谢他给的零用钱，他不在乎你提不提这个，而是让你写一封信说说你的学习进展，以及生活细节，就好像你的父母还在世，你会给他们写的信一样。收信人的名字叫约翰·史密斯，信件由他的秘书转交。这并不是他的真名，他宁愿不让人知道他的真名。对你而言，他永远就是约翰·史密斯。他让你写信，是因为他认为没什么能比写信更能培养人的文学表达能力，既然你没有家人可以通信，他希望你用给家人写信的方式来给他写信。同样地，他也希望能知道你的进展。他不会回你的信，也不会特别挑剔你的来信。他不喜欢写信，也不希望写信成为你的负担。如果有什么紧急问题，有必要回复你的话——譬如你被开除，我相信这种事是不会发生的——你可以和他的秘书格利兹先生联系。对你这一方，这些信件则是绝对的义务，这是史密斯先生对你唯一的要求。因此，你必须把信当成要按时支付的账单一样准时寄出。我希望你的语气能一直保持恭敬，这能反映出你所受到的教育。你必须牢牢记住，你的信是写给约翰·格里尔之家的一位理事。”

杰瑞莎的眼神急切地找寻门在哪里，她已经兴奋得晕头转向了，这会儿，她只希望从李佩特太太的老生常谈中逃开，而后想一想。她起身，试探着退了一步，李佩特太太用手势示意她留下来——这可是一个难得的演说机会。

“我相信，对于这从天而降的好运气你一定是心存感激吧？像你这种情况的女孩子很少有这种见世面的机会，你必须永远地记住——”

“我——是的，太太，谢谢您。我想，要是没有其他事的话，我得去补弗雷德的裤子了。”

门在她身后关上了。李佩特太太盯着门咽下了一肚子被打断的唠叨。她才刚刚说到兴头呢。





杰瑞莎·艾伯特写给长腿叔叔史密斯的信


敬爱的、好心的、送孤儿上大学的理事：

是我呀！昨天我坐了四个小时的火车。新奇的感受，不是吗？我之前还从来没有坐过火车呢。

大学这么大，是最能让人犯迷糊的地方呀——只要离开自己的房间我就会迷路。等我感觉没这么混乱的时候再给您细细描述一番，并向您汇报我的课程。不过，要等到星期一早晨才开始上课呢，这会儿是星期六的晚上。但我还是想先写信给您，彼此熟悉一下。

给一个不认识的人写信感觉很怪。实际上对我来说写信这件事就很奇怪——我这辈子到现在写过的信也没超过三四封。所以，要是不规范的话，就请忽略不计吧。

昨天上午走以前，李佩特太太和我有过一次非常严肃的谈话。她告诉我今后该如何为人处世，特别是怎么同一位对我这么仁慈的好心先生相处。我务必要对他非常恭敬。

然而，对一位名叫约翰·史密斯的人，我如何尊敬得起来呢？为什么您不选个稍微有点个性的名字？我倒不如给亲爱的拴马桩或者亲爱的衣架子写信。

整个夏天，我想了很多很多有关您的事情。这么多年，忽然有个人关心我，让我觉得好像有了个家，觉得有了归宿。这是种令人陶醉的感觉。然而我不得不说的是，当我想到您的时候，我的脑子总是空空的。我只知道三件事：

一、您是高个子。

二、您很有钱。

三、您不喜欢女孩子。

我猜我可以叫您“敬爱的不喜女孩先生”，但这有伤我的自尊；或许我可以称您“亲爱的有钱人先生”，但这似乎对您很无礼，好像您唯一值得提的就是钱。此外，富有是一种外在特征，也许您不会富有一辈子，很多聪明人都在华尔街栽了跟头呢。不过，至少您的身高是改变不了的！所以我决定叫您长腿叔叔。希望您不会介意，这只是个私人之间的昵称——咱们不要告诉李佩特太太了吧。

还有两分钟十点钟的钟声就要敲响了。我们的一天被钟声分成一段段的，我们听着钟声按时吃饭、睡觉、学习，这使我格外有活力，每时每刻都活得像个消防员。听，铃响了！该熄灯了。祝您晚安。

瞧！我多么守规矩——这得归功于格里尔孤儿院的训练。

您最最恭敬的

杰瑞莎·艾伯特

9月24日

于费格森楼215室





敬爱的长腿叔叔史密斯：

我爱大学，我爱您，因为您送我上了大学——我真的非常非常快乐，我兴奋到难以入睡，时时刻刻我都这么兴奋。您无法想象，这里和约翰·格里尔孤儿院是如此不同！我从不知道世界上还有这样的好地方。我真替那些不是女孩子和不能来这里的人感到遗憾。我深信您年轻时读的大学不会有这般美妙。

我的房间在一栋塔楼上。在新的医务室建成之前，这里曾经是间传染病房。塔楼的这一层还有另外三个女孩子：一个已经大四了，戴着眼镜，她总是叫我们安静一点；还有两个大一的女孩子，萨莉·迈克布莱德和茱莉娅·拉特利奇·彭德莱顿。萨莉一头红发，鼻头翘翘的，对人非常友好；茱莉娅出身纽约名门，她还没有注意到我呢。她们俩住在一起，我和那个大四的姑娘住单人间。一般来说，大一学生住不上单人间，因为单人间很少，而我甚至没提要求就得到了一间。我猜注册处的人认为有教养的女孩是不能与弃儿同住的。您看，这也是有好处的呀！

我的房间在西北角，有两扇窗子，窗外风景宜人。同二十个人在一间宿舍里住了十八年，如今独处一室，感觉格外轻松。这是我第一次有机会好好地认识自己——杰瑞莎·艾伯特，我想我会喜欢她的。

您觉得您会吗？

l0月1日





她们正在组建大一篮球队，我一定要争取这个机会。虽然我身材瘦小，不过我动作敏捷、身体强壮呀。她们还跳在半空中的时候，我就能从她们的脚底钻过去抢球。练球很开心——下午出来站到田径场上，和那些红的黄的树在一块儿，空气中到处都是焚烧叶子的气味，每个人都在笑啊叫啊。她们是我见过的最快乐的女孩子了——而我是她们当中最为快乐的一个！

我本来打算写一封长信告诉您我都学了些什么（李佩特太太说您想知道），但是第七节课的钟声刚刚敲过，十分钟后我就得穿着运动服到田径场上去。您希望我加入这支球队吗？

您永远的

杰瑞莎·艾伯特

星期二

又及（九点）：

萨莉·迈克布莱德刚才把头探到我的门里。

她说：“我太想家了，我快受不了啦。你呢？”

我笑笑说：“不，我想我可以克服的。”至少想家这种病我是绝不会得的，没听说过有人会想念孤儿院的，对吧？





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

您有没有听说过米开朗琪罗？

他是中世纪意大利著名的画家。修英国文学课的人好像都知道他。我以为他是个大天使，惹得全班哄堂大笑。可是这名字听起来确实很像大天使，您说对不对？这是读大学的麻烦，人人都认为你应该知道很多很多你从来就没学过的东西。有时这让人很尴尬。不过现在，每当同学们谈论那些我没听说过的东西时，我就安安静静地去查百科全书。

上学第一天我就闹了个大笑话，有人提起莫里斯·梅特林克(1)，我问人家她是不是个大一新生。这个笑话传遍了整个校园。但是不管怎样，我和班里其他人一样聪明——比其中一些人还更聪明些！

您想知道我的房间怎么布置的吗？它是一曲棕黄相间的交响乐。淡黄色的墙壁，配上我买来的黄色粗布窗帘和靠垫，还有一张三美元的二手红褐色书桌、一把藤椅、一块染着墨迹的棕色地毯，我用椅子把墨迹遮住了。

窗子很高，坐在椅子上看不到窗外。我把梳妆台的镜子拆掉，铺上桌布，然后移到窗前，坐在上面看窗外高度刚好合适。把抽屉拉开当成台阶，上来下去，真的很舒服！

这些东西都是萨莉·迈克布莱德帮我在大四学生拍卖会上挑的，她生活在正常的家庭里，懂得怎么布置。您是没法想象购物的乐趣的，付一张真正的五美元钞票，换一把零钱回来的快乐的——在一生中从来没有得到多于五分钱的硬币之时！我向您发誓，亲爱的叔叔，我真的感谢您给我的零用钱。

萨莉是全世界最好玩的人——茱莉娅是最无趣的人。

注册处把这么一对安排在一间寝室，也真是够古怪的。萨莉认为所有的事，甚至考试不及格都是有趣的；然而茱莉娅厌倦所有一切，她从来不花心思让自己变得亲切一点，她以为只要是姓彭德莱顿，就可以不用经历任何考验直接进天堂了。我和茱莉娅是天生的对头。

现在我猜您已经等得不耐烦了，想要知道我学了些什么吧？

一、拉丁文：第二次迦太基战争。汉尼拔将军和他的部队在特拉西梅诺湖的最后一夜宿营。凌晨四点战争爆发。罗马败退。

二、法语：读到《三个火枪手》第二十四页，还有不规则动词的第三种变化。

三、几何：柱体已经学完了，现在在学圆锥体。

四、英文：学习说明文。我的写作风格在简洁和清晰程度上每天都有所提高。

五、生理学：学到了消化系统，下次要学胆汁和胰腺。

您的，正在接受教育的

杰瑞莎·艾伯特

10月10日

又及：我希望您不喝酒，叔叔。因为它对您的肝会造成致命伤害。





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

我改名字了。

在学生名册里我还是杰瑞莎，不过在其他地方我都叫茱迪。把自己这辈子唯一的昵称拿出来，这算不算很糟糕呢？不过茱迪也不是我取的，是弗雷德·伯金斯咿呀学语时这么叫我的。

真希望李佩特太太给孩子们选名字的时候能多一点想象力。她是从电话号码簿上找姓氏的，艾伯特在第一页。然后再随随便便从哪里找个教名就行了。杰瑞莎这名字是她在墓碑上找到的，我很讨厌它，我更喜欢茱迪。这真是个傻乎乎的名字，这名字应该属于那种和我不一样的女孩儿——长着蓝眼睛的甜美小家伙，被家里所有人宠着惯着，能够漫不经心、蹦蹦跳跳地度过一生。这样的生活好吗？但是不管我会有什么错，都不会有人说我是被家里宠的！不过呢，假装自己就是这样的女孩也蛮有趣的。那您以后就叫我茱迪吧。

您想不想知道？我有三双小羊皮手套。以前我从圣诞树上拿到过一双连指的手套，不过我从来没有真正的五指分开的皮手套。每隔一会儿，我就把它们拿出来戴戴，好不容易才忍住没把它们戴进教室去。

晚餐的钟声响了。再见。

星期三





您知道吗，叔叔？英文导师说我的上一篇作文显示出了非凡的创造力。她真的这么说的。她就是这样说的。考虑到我过去的十八年所受到的教育，这似乎是不可能的，对吗？约翰·格里尔之家的目标（毫无疑问正如您知道而且衷心赞许的）是把九十七个孤儿培养成一模一样的九十七胞胎。

孤儿



我展现出的不同寻常的艺术天分是由小时候在木板门上画李佩特太太发展而来的。

但愿我评论自己儿时的家不会伤害您的感情？但您是占着上风的，您知道的，如果我太无礼，您可以终止付款。谈这些不是太礼貌——但您不能指望我有什么修养，孤儿院毕竟不是淑女培养学校。

您知道的，叔叔，在大学里难的并不是功课，而是玩。有一半的时间，我不知道那些女孩子在说什么，她们之间的玩笑似乎和每个人的过去都有关系，但只和我没有关系。我在这个世界上是个局外人，我不懂她们的语言，感觉很悲惨。我一直以来都有这样的感觉。高中时，女孩子们一群一群地站在那儿打量我。我是古怪的，不一样的，每个人都知道。我能感觉到“约翰·格里尔之家”就写在我的脸上。个别好心的会挑个时候过来，礼貌地说上几句话。我讨厌她们所有人——最讨厌这些好心人。

这里没有人知道我是孤儿院长大的。我告诉萨莉我的父母去世了，一位好心的老先生送我上的大学——这全都是真的。我不想让您认为我懦弱，但是，我想和其他女孩子一样，而那个孤儿院令人不快的阴影笼罩了我的童年，这是我们之间最大的不同。假如我可以转过身去，关闭所有的记忆，我觉得我会像其他女孩子一样讨人喜欢。我不相信我和她们会有什么真正的区别，您说呢？

不管怎么样，萨莉·迈克布莱德喜欢我！

您永远的

茱迪·艾伯特（原名杰瑞莎）

星期五





我刚刚把这封信又读了一遍，它似乎有点令人低沉。不过，您知道吗？下星期一上午我得交一个专题，还要复习一下几何，而且我还感冒了，不停地打喷嚏。

星期六早晨

昨天我忘记寄信了，所以我要再加几句牢骚话。今天早上我们见到了一个主教，您猜猜他说了什么？

“我们从《圣经》中最受益的警句是这一句：‘因为常有穷人和你们同在。’(2)他们所以在此，就是为了让我们永远怀有慈悲之心。”

请注意，穷人是有用的家养牲口。要是我不像今天这么有教养，我就会在礼拜之后走上去，告诉他我的想法。

星期天





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

我进了篮球队，您真该看看我左肩的瘀伤啊。青一块紫一块，还夹着一小条一小条橘色的划痕。茱莉娅也申请加入篮球队，但是没能成功。万岁！

茱迪在打篮球



您看，我真是心胸狭窄呀。

大学生活一天比一天更好。我喜欢姑娘们、老师、班级、校园，还有吃的东西。我们每个星期吃两次冰淇淋，从来没吃过玉米糊糊。

您是不是只愿意我一个月写一封信？而我每隔几天就写信来烦您！不过，这些全新的经历让我太兴奋了，我一定得找个人说说，而您是我唯一认识的人。请原谅我精力充沛，我会很快安静下来的。如果我的信打扰了您，您可以随时把它扔进废纸篓。我发誓到十一月中旬之前我不再写信了。

您话最多的

茱迪·艾伯特

10月25日





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

听听我今天都学了些什么：

一个平截头正棱锥体的表面积等于底边周长和梯形一边高度乘积的一半。

听起来不像真的，但这是真的，我可以证明！

您还从来没有听我聊聊我的衣服吧，叔叔？我有六件衣服，全都是新的，很漂亮，都是专门为我买的——不是哪个大孩子穿小了才给我的。也许您没法想象，这在一个孤儿的生命中意味着什么。这些都是您送给我的，我非常、非常、非常感激。接受教育是件好事——然而没有什么比拥有六件新衣服更让人幸福。感谢上帝！这些衣服是巡查委员会的普里查德小姐替我挑的，不是李佩特太太。一件粉红色的薄丝绸晚装（我穿着很漂亮）、一件蓝色礼拜服、一件东方花边的红色细纱晚宴服（让我看上去像个吉卜赛人），还有一件玫瑰色便装，另外一套灰色的是上街穿的，还有一件平时上课穿。对茱莉娅来说，也许这不算什么，但是对杰瑞莎·艾伯特——天哪，我的！

我估计您现在想的是，她是个多么轻佻、浅薄的女孩子啊，送她上大学真浪费钱。

不过，叔叔，要是您一辈子都穿着别人穿过的横格棉布衫，您就能体会我的感受了。再说了，上高中以后，我穿的还不如横格棉布衫呢。

那糟糕的济困盒。

您不会知道我是多么害怕穿着那些可怜的施舍盒子里的衣服去学校。我担心邻座的女孩就是衣服之前的主人，她会咯咯发笑，小声地告诉别人这件事。一想到自己穿着的衣服可能是自己讨厌的人扔掉的，更让人难过。即使余生天天穿长筒丝袜，也不能弥补我的心理创伤。

最新战报！

来自现场的报道

11月13日星期四凌晨四点，汉尼拔击退罗马的先遣部队，领导迦太基部队翻越山脉进入了卡西列侬平原。轻装的努米比亚部队与奎因图斯·费比乌斯·马克西姆斯的部队交战。有两场战斗以及小规模冲突。罗马一方损失惨重。

很荣幸能为您播报。

您来自前线的特别通讯员

茱迪·艾伯特

又及：我知道我不该期待任何的回音，也有人警告过我，别用任何问题去打扰您。不过，叔叔，就这一次，请您告诉我——您是很老很老了呢，还是只是有一点点老？您是全秃了呢，还是只有一丁点秃？抽象地想象您的样子太难，就跟学几何定理一样难。

一个有钱的高个子男人，他讨厌女孩子，但是他对一个非常无礼的女孩子却那么宽宏大量，他能长什么样呢？

盼回复。

11月15日





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

您没有回答我的问题，但是这个问题非常重要。

您秃不秃？

我已经想好了您的模样，相当令人满意。直到我想象到您的头顶，然后我就开始困惑了，我没法决定您的头发是白的还是黑的，也可能是斑驳灰发。也或者，都错了？

这个是您的肖像。



然而问题是，我是不是该加点头发呢？

您想知道自己的眼睛是什么颜色的吗？灰色的，眉毛往外突，像廊檐一样（悬浮式，小说里会这么写），您的嘴巴呈一条直线，嘴角向下。哦，您看看，我知道了！您是个坏脾气的爽快老头。

（礼拜钟响了！）

12月19日

晚上九点四十五分

我给自己订了一条雷打不动的规则：永远永远不在晚上学习，无论第二天的早上有多少书面测试。我要读些简单的书——我必须这么做，您知道的，我过去的十八年是一片空白。您没法相信，叔叔，我是多么无知，我也是刚意识到自己的肤浅。那些有完整家庭、房屋、朋友和图书馆的女孩子知道的，我都从来没有听说过。比如：

我从没有读过《鹅妈妈》《大卫·科波菲尔》《伊凡诺沃》《灰姑娘》《蓝胡子》《鲁滨孙漂流记》《简·爱》《爱丽丝漫游仙境》，卢亚迪·吉卜林的作品我一个字也没读过。我不知道亨利八世结过不止一次婚，我不知道雪莱原来是个诗人，我不知道人类最初是猴子，也不知道伊甸园是个美妙的神话故事。我不知道R. L. S.是罗伯特·路易斯·史蒂文森(3)的缩写，我不知道乔治·艾略特(4)原来是位女士，我连《蒙娜丽莎》这幅画也没见过，还有（您不会相信的，但这是真的）我从来没有听说过夏洛克·福尔摩斯。

现在，这些我都知道了，还有另外的一些，您能明白我多么需要赶功课了吧。噢，真有意思！我整天都盼着快快到夜晚，而后我就可以把“正忙勿扰”的牌子往门上一挂，穿着舒服的红睡袍，套上毛茸茸的拖鞋，把所有的垫子放在沙发上靠着坐下来，点亮肘边的黄铜灯，读书，读书，读书。一本不够，我同时读四本。现在，我正在读丁尼生的诗集、《名利场》、吉卜林的《平凡故事》，还有——不要笑我——《小妇人》。我发现在学校里我是唯一没有受《小妇人》影响的女孩子，我没告诉任何人（这会给我贴上古怪的标签），我只能静静地走开，从上个月的零花钱里拿出一美元十二美分买了这本书，下次有人再说酸柠檬的时候，我就知道她在说什么了！

（十点的钟声响了。这封信中断好几次了。）





先生：

我很荣幸地向您报告几何课方面的新收获。星期五我们终于结束了平行六面体的功课，开始学习截棱锥体。学习的道路真是艰难而曲折。

星期六

下个星期圣诞节就要到了，圣诞树已经立好了，走廊乱成一团，走过去都很困难。每个人都兴高采烈，功课都被抛到了九霄云外。假期我会有一段美好的日子，还有一个大一学生打算留下来，她是得克萨斯人。我们打算到郊区徒步，如果结冰了，就学着溜冰。图书馆整个假期都开放，有三个星期的时间可以待在里面看书！

再见，叔叔，我希望您和我一样高兴。

您永远的

茱迪

又及：别忘记回答我的问题。如果您觉得写字很麻烦，就叫您的秘书拍电报吧。他可以只说：

史密斯先生很秃，

或者

史密斯先生不秃，

或者

史密斯先生白发。

二十五美分的电报费您就从我的零花钱里扣掉好了。一月再见——圣诞节快乐！

星期天





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

您住的地方下雪了吗？从我的塔楼看出去，满世界都飘着白色，雪花有爆米花那么大。现在已经快晚上了——冷黄色的太阳落在更冷的紫罗兰色的山麓后头，我坐在窗前，借着最后的一线光芒给您写信。

您的五个金币真是意外的惊喜！我以前从没收到过圣诞礼物呢！您已经给了我这么多东西——我所有的一切，您明白吗，我真的觉得我不该收额外的礼物，但我还是很喜欢。您想知道我把钱都花在什么了地方吗？

一、一块有皮革盒子包装的银表，表正戴在我的手腕上，提醒我准时背书。

二、马修·阿诺德诗集。

三、一个热水瓶。

四、一条围毯（我的塔楼很冷）。

五、五百张黄色稿纸（我很快就要开始当作家了）。

六、一本同义词字典（用以扩大作家的词汇量）。

七、（我不大愿意告诉您这最后一项，但是我还是得告诉您）一双丝袜。

瞧，长腿叔叔，永远不要说我对您有所保留！

如果您非要明白丝袜是怎么回事，那么我就告诉您吧。这出于一种非常浅薄的动机。茱莉娅·彭德莱顿每天晚上来我的房间做几何作业，她跷着腿坐在沙发上，穿着丝袜。等着瞧，她度假回来后，我就穿着丝袜去她的房间，坐在她的沙发上。您瞧，叔叔，您一定认为我有点儿坏，但，至少我很诚实，您知道我在孤儿院的记录，我并不完美，对不对？

扼要地说（这是英语老师每次说话的开场白），我非常感激您的七件礼物。我骗自己它们是从我加利福尼亚的家里送过来的。手表是爸爸送的，围毯是妈妈送的，热水瓶是祖母送的——她老是担心这种天气我会着凉。黄色的稿纸呢，是我的小弟弟哈里送的，妹妹伊索贝尔送了我丝袜，苏珊姑妈送的是马修·阿诺德诗集，哈里叔叔（小哈里的名字就来自他的名字）送了我字典。他本来想送给我巧克力的，但是我坚持要同义词字典。

您不反对扮演全部这些家庭成员吧？

现在呢，是不是该跟您讲讲我的假期了？或者，您只对我的教育本身感兴趣？希望您能欣赏“本身”这个词义的细微差别，这是我新掌握的词汇。

得克萨斯的女孩叫莉奥诺拉·芬顿。（几乎和杰瑞莎一样的滑稽，是不是？）我喜欢她，但不如喜欢萨莉那样。我真的不可能喜欢谁会到喜欢萨莉那种地步——除了您，我总是最爱您的，因为您是我全家的化身。莉奥诺拉、我，还有两个大二学生，每逢好天气就在乡间穿行，我们穿着短裙和针织夹克，戴着便帽，带着一根曲棍球棍来敲敲打打，探索周围所有的地方。有一次我们走进了城，走了大约有四英里吧，去了一家女大学生吃饭的餐馆，要了烤虾（三十五美分）、甜点、荞麦蛋糕、槭糖浆（十五美分），真是既营养又便宜。

太好玩了！特别是对我来说，因为它和孤儿院那么的不一样。每次离开校园的时候，我都感觉自己像个离开牢笼的犯人。我没仔细想一想就开始跟别人讲自己的经历，等收住话题，秘密都已经快泄露啦。我这个人天生容易相信别人，不把自己知道的事情说出来简直太困难了。要是没有您可以说说话，我会爆炸的。

上个星期五的晚上，另一幢宿舍楼费格森楼左侧宿舍的舍监给我们一个拉糖蜜的机会。我们二十二个学生，大一的、大二的、大三的、大四的，都友好相处。那里的厨房非常大，铜锅、水壶在石头墙上挂成一排一排的——最小的炖锅也有洗衣锅那么大。有四百个女孩住在费格森楼呢。厨师戴着白帽子，系着白围裙，给我们拿出来二十二顶白帽子和二十二条围裙——简直不能想象，他从哪里弄来的这么多东西——然后我们就一起拉糖蜜了。

尽管我见过更好的糖，但还是觉得很好玩。最后做完的时候，我们自己、厨房、门把手全都变得黏糊糊的了。我们穿着那一身衣服，每个人拿着把大叉子，或者是汤勺，或者是平底盘，排着队伍穿过空荡荡的走廊，去了教职员工休息室，在那儿有好几个教授、导师本打算度过一个平静的夜晚，而我们唱着校园歌曲为他们送上糖蜜，他们很礼貌地收下了我们的糖蜜，但一脸的狐疑。我们静静地离开休息室，让他们吃那些大块大块的、黏黏的蜜糖。



所以你看，叔叔，我在进步呢！

但是您不认为我应该当个艺术家，而不是作家吗？

再有两天假期就要结束了。能够再见到那些女孩子，我会很开心的。我的塔楼有点寂寞，九个人占据了一幢能容纳四百人的大房子时，的确有点空荡。

十一页，可怜的叔叔，您肯定烦了！我本来只打算写一封简短的便函致谢的，但一写就收不住了。

再见。并且，还要谢谢您能想着我——我一切都好，除了在地平线的地方有一小朵越来越近的乌云以外。二月份就要考试了。

爱您的

茱迪

写于圣诞假期尾声

（不知道确切日期）

又及：说爱您是不是不太合适？如果不合适的话，请千万不要介意。我一定得爱一个人，但我只有您和李佩特太太可选择，您不得不忍受一下。亲爱的叔叔，因为我实在没办法爱她。





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

您应该来看看这学校学习起来的架势！我们已经忘了假期，四天之内，我背了五十七个不规则动词，我真希望到考试的时候我还记得它们。

有些女孩子课本用完了就卖了，不过我想要留着它们。毕业以后，我可以把自己学过的知识在书架上排成一行，每当我要用某一细节时，都能毫不犹豫地找出来，这比留在脑子里容易，并且也准确多了。

茱莉娅·彭德莱顿今天晚上顺道过来礼节性拜访，待了整整一个小时，她谈起了家庭，我没法逃避，她想知道我妈妈结婚前的姓氏是什么——竟然问一个孤儿院的孩子这么粗鲁的问题，您大概从没听说过吧？我没有勇气告诉她我不知道，所以我只能痛苦地说出了第一个浮出脑海的名字——蒙哥马利。而后她又问是马萨诸塞州的蒙哥马利家，还是维吉尼亚州的蒙哥马利家。

她妈妈姓拉瑟福德，这个家族可以上溯到方舟时代，曾经和亨利八世联过姻。她爸爸那边，可以回溯到比亚当还遥远的年代。她家的谱系图最早的一支是一只优美的猴子，长着丝绸一样质地的柔顺毛发，还有奇长的尾巴。

其实，我想给你写一封优雅的、开心的、好玩的信，但我困了——还受了惊吓。大一学生命运真苦啊。

您考试前夕的

茱迪·艾伯特





最亲爱的长腿叔叔：

我要告诉您一个很糟、很糟、很糟的消息，但我不打算开始就说，我要先让您高兴一下。

杰瑞莎·艾伯特是个作家了。我有一首名叫《来自塔楼》的诗发表在二月《月刊》上——首页，对一个大一学生来说，这是一种极大的荣耀。昨天晚上，导师在从小礼堂出来的路上拦住我，说除了第六行以外，这是首很不错的作品，第六行的韵脚太多了。要是您想看一看的话，我给您寄一份去。

让我想想，是否还有其他高兴的事——噢，是的！我在学溜冰，我可以非常自在地一个人滑了。我学会了怎么从体育馆顶上的斜坡滑下来，我还能跳过三英尺六英寸高的障碍物——我希望我很快就能跳过四英尺的。

今天上午，我们听了亚拉巴马州主教的一场非常鼓舞人心的布道。他说：“你们不要评判人，免得自己被评判。”也就是说，要原谅别人的错误，不要用苛刻的批评让别人泄气。我真希望您也听了。

在这个最为晴朗、最为炫目的冬日下午，杉树上垂挂着冰凌，在雪的压力之下，整个世界都弯曲了——除了我，我是在悲伤的力量下弯曲的。

现在，到坏消息了——鼓起勇气，茱迪！——你必须说出来。

您确定现在的心情还好吗？我的数学和拉丁散文不及格。我正在上补习课，准备参加下个月的补考。如果您失望了，我会很难过的。不过，从另一方面说，要不是因为您的话，我一点儿也不在乎，因为我学到了那么多课本里没有的东西。我读了十七本小说和大量的诗歌——小说都是必须要读的，像《名利场》《理查·费福罗》《爱丽丝漫游仙境》，爱默生的《散文集》、洛克哈特的《瓦尔特·斯各特爵士回忆录》、吉本·爱德华的《罗马帝国兴亡史》第一卷，还有看了一半《贝温尤托·切利尼生平》——这个人是不是很有意思？他习惯于清晨四处闲逛，随便杀个人之后再回来吃早餐。

一月新闻



您瞧，叔叔，要是我只是死啃拉丁文，现在不会懂得这么多的。如果我向您保证，我再也不会不及格了，您能不能原谅我一回呢？

您忏悔的

茱迪

星期天





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

这是本月中一封额外的信，因为今天晚上我有点孤独，外面是暴风雪，雪花拍打着我的塔楼。学校的灯全熄了，但我喝了黑咖啡，睡不着。

今天晚上我和萨莉、茱莉娅、莉奥诺拉·芬顿一起吃饭，我们吃的是沙丁鱼、烤松饼、沙拉、奶油软糖，还有咖啡。茱莉娅说她玩得很高兴，而萨莉留在这里帮我洗盘子。

我今天晚上应该认真地学习拉丁文，不过不用说了，我是个懒散的拉丁文学生。我们已经学完了李维(5)和《论老年》(6)，现在正学习《论友谊》（读着像该死的伊里西亚）(7)。

您介不介意假装是我奶奶，就一会儿？萨莉有奶奶，茱莉娅、莉奥诺拉则是外婆、奶奶都在。她们今天晚上相互比来着。我想象不出我要是有奶奶的话该是什么样子。那是一种多么可敬的关系啊。所以，要是您真的不反对的话——昨天我进城的时候，看见一顶非常漂亮的帽子，紫色缎带镶的克鲁尼花边，我准备在您八十三岁生日的时候把它当礼物送给您。

小礼拜堂的钟敲响了十二点，我困得不行了。

晚安，“奶奶”。我爱您。

茱迪





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

我正在学习拉丁语散文写作。我一直在学。我应该学。我应该开始不断学习了。下个星期四的第七节课我就要补考了，要是不能及格就全砸了。所以，也许您可以从下次我写的信中听到我完整、快乐、没什么补考的消息，或者我已经成了一堆碎片。

等考试结束，我会写一封恭恭敬敬的信。今天晚上我要学拉丁语的夺格独立词。

您匆匆而就的

茱迪

3月15日





长腿叔叔史密斯先生：

先生，您从没回答我的任何问题，您从没对我的事情表现出一丁点儿的兴趣。您也许是那群可怕的理事中最为可怕的那一个，您资助我受教育，并不是因为您有一丝一毫关心我，只是责任感罢了。

我不知道您的任何事情，我甚至不知道您的名字，给一样东西写信令人一点儿精神都提不起来。我毫不怀疑您会随手把信扔进垃圾箱，读也不读。从今以后，我只写学习的事。

拉丁文和几何补考上个星期考过了，都通过了，再也没什么补考了。

您真诚的

杰瑞莎·艾伯特

3月26日





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

我是个浑蛋。

请忘掉上个礼拜我给您的那封可恶的信吧——那天晚上写信的时候，我感到可怕的孤独、悲凉，我的喉咙很痛。当时我不知道自己得了扁桃腺炎和流行性感冒，还有各种混杂的毛病。现在我在医务室，我在这里已经六天了。这是医护人员第一次同意我坐起来，给了我纸和笔。护士长非常凶。但如果您不原谅我，我的病怎么都不会好了，每时每刻我都在想这件事。

这儿有一幅画，画的是我现在的样子，纱布绕着脑袋包了一圈，扎出一双兔子耳朵。



这幅画有没有激起您的同情心？我的舌下腺肿大。学了一年生理学，我竟然没有听说过舌下腺。教育真是无用的啊！

我不能再写了，坐时间太长我会发抖。请原谅我的粗鲁和忘恩负义。我这个人缺少教养。

爱您的

茱迪·艾伯特

4月2日





最亲爱的长腿叔叔：

昨天傍晚天色渐黑，我坐在床上看外面的雨，正觉得待在医院极为无聊，护士拿着一个写着我名字的白色长盒子进来了，盒子里面放满了最可爱的粉红色玫瑰花骨朵。然而更棒的是，盒子里有张卡片，用好玩的上斜反手字体写了有礼貌的留言（它透露了许多的个人特征）。谢谢您，叔叔，谢您一千次。这一生中我真正、真实地收到的第一份礼物就是您的花儿。您想知道我有多么的孩子气吗？我躺下来哭了，因为我实在太高兴了！

现在我能肯定您看过我的信了，我会把信写得更有趣的，这样的话，我的信就值得扎上红带子保存在保险箱里了——只是，请您把那封讨厌的信拿出来烧掉吧。我不想让您再读那封信了。

谢谢您，您让一个脾气暴躁、病歪歪的、可怜的大一学生很开心。也许您有亲爱的家人和朋友，并不知道寂寞的滋味是怎么样的。可是我知道。

再见——我发誓再也不招人讨厌了。因为我现在知道您是一个真实存在的人了。还有，我发誓再也不会用任何问题打扰您了。

您还讨厌女孩子吗？

您永远的

茱迪

4月4日

写于医务室





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

希望您不是那位曾经一下子坐到癞蛤蟆身上的理事！当时发出——我听说的——一声巨响，所以想来他是一位更胖的理事吧。

您记得约翰·格里尔之家洗衣房窗户边的那些被栅栏盖住的小洞吧。每年的春天，蟾蜍季来临的时候，我们都去捉蟾蜍，而后就把它们养在那些窗户洞里。有时候它们会跑进洗衣房，于是洗衣服的那天就会引发一阵阵快活的骚乱。为此我们受到严厉的惩罚，然而尽管如此，我们还是会去捉蟾蜍。

有一天——好吧，我不用这么琐屑的小事烦您了——不知道为什么，一只最胖、最大、最有劲儿的蟾蜍跑到了理事房，待在一把大皮椅子上，而那天下午是理事会议……但是我敢说，那天您肯定在的，您还记得后来的事情吗？

隔了一段时间冷静地回头看，我受到的惩罚是应得的——而且，要是我记得没错的话——也算得上恰如其分。

我不知道自己为什么会沉浸在回忆的情绪之中，要不然就是因为春天来了，再一次出现的蟾蜍唤起了以往熟悉的本能。而唯一的问题是，这里没有谁禁止捕捉蟾蜍，我也就不想去抓了。

星期一早上八点





您猜猜我最喜欢的书是什么？我就指现在这会儿。我最近的兴趣三天一变。现在我最喜欢《呼啸山庄》。艾米莉·勃朗特写这本书的时候还非常年轻，从没有出过霍沃思教区。她的一生又不认识哪个男人，她怎么会想得出来希思克利夫那种男人呢？

我是做不到的，我也很年轻，也没有走出过约翰·格里尔孤儿院——我具备了成功的条件和机会。有时候，一种致命的恐惧会笼罩我，我害怕自己根本就不是个天才。那样的话，叔叔，若我不能成为一位了不起的作家，您会不会很失望？春天里，万物如此美好，新绿萌发、苞芽初生，我觉得我应该放下功课，逃出去和大自然做游戏。在田野里，有那么多那么多可以玩的！读书比写书有趣多了！

啊！！！

我一声尖叫，把萨莉、茱莉娅还有（真倒霉）那个大四学生引了过来，因为我看到一条这样子的蜈蚣：



还有更糟的。我刚写完上一句，正思考下一句的时候——砰！——它从房顶掉了下来，降落在我的身边。为了逃跑，我碰翻了茶几上的两只茶杯，萨莉用我的梳子背狠狠砸它——这把梳子我以后再也不用啦——杀了它的前半截，而后面的将近五十只脚又蹿到桌子底下逃走了。

这宿舍年代久远，墙面爬满了常青藤，楼里到处是蜈蚣。它们真是种极为可怕的生灵，我宁可在床底下发现一只老虎。

星期四，礼拜之后





麻烦事接二连三！今天早晨我没听见起床铃，匆匆忙忙穿戴的时候拽断了鞋带，还把领子的扣子系在了脖子下面。吃早饭迟到，一小时的复习也去晚了。而且一张吸墨纸也没带，自来水钢笔还漏水了。三角学课上，我和教授在对数问题上意见不同，然而检查过后发现她是对的。午餐是炖羊肉和大黄，吃起来味道跟孤儿院没两样，我哪个也不爱吃。我的信里除了账单什么也没有（尽管以前我也从未收到过什么，我家里人都不爱写信）。今天下午的英语课，没想到是写作。以下就是(8)：

我不要别的东西——

别的东西——都未予拒绝——

为了它——我献出了生命——

大商人却出言戏谑——

巴西？他旋转一粒纽扣——




对我不屑一顾——

但是——小姐——难道再没别的

我们能在今天展示的——什物？

这是首诗。我不知道是谁写的，又到底是什么意思。我们进教室的时候，就写在黑板上，而且要求我们评论。读第一节时，我有了个念头——商人是个神，他为了回报善行而分配祝福——但读到第二节的时候，发现他转着一颗扣子，似乎是个不敬神的形象，我又匆忙地改变了主意。班里其他同学也一样困惑。我们在那儿坐了四十五分钟，拿着张白纸，头脑一片空白。接受教育真是个可怕的磨炼过程！

然而这并没有结束，更糟糕的还没来呢。

下雨了，我们没法打高尔夫，只能去体育馆。我旁边的一个女生用体操棍狠狠地撞在了我的胳膊肘上。回宿舍以后，我看到新的蓝色春装装在盒子里送来了，但裙子太紧了，坐都坐不下去。星期五是大扫除的时间，清洁员把我桌子上的纸全弄乱了。我们今天的甜点叫“墓碑”，是一种牛奶香草味的果冻。我们在礼拜堂比平时多待了二十分钟，听一场关于女性的演讲。我刚刚松了口气，开始看《贵妇人的肖像》时，一个叫阿克莉的女孩——她长着面团脸，没活力，还笨手笨脚的——又来问我星期一的课是从第六十九还是第七十小节开始。上拉丁课时，她就坐我旁边，因为她的姓和我一样也是A开头（真希望李佩特太太给我的是个Z开头的姓，比如扎布里斯基）。她待了有一个小时，刚刚才走。

您有没有听说过这么一连串的倒霉事？生活中，并不只是在大难临头时，才需要表现出品格。任何人都需要勇气面对能把人压垮的悲剧和危机，然而笑对日常生活中的小麻烦——我真觉得这是需要一种精神力量的。

这就是一种我想要培养的品格。我要视生活为一场游戏，我要努力玩得熟练而又漂亮。若是我失败了，就耸耸肩，笑一下——要是赢了，也一样。

不管怎么样，我要成长为一个输得起的人。亲爱的叔叔，您再也不会听到我因为茱莉娅穿着丝袜，或者蜈蚣从墙上掉下来而抱怨了。

请速速回信。

您永远的

茱迪

星期五，晚九点半





亲爱的长腿叔叔先生：

亲爱的先生，我收到一封李佩特太太的信。她希望我在学校的表现不错，因为这个夏天我可能无处可去，她愿意让我回孤儿院，食宿以工作折算，直到大学开学。

我恨约翰·格里尔之家。

我宁可死也不回去。

您最真诚的

杰瑞莎·艾伯特

5月27日





亲爱的长腿叔叔(9)：

您真是个好心人！

我很高兴去农场，我还从来没去过农场呢。我讨厌回到约翰·格里尔去洗一个夏天的盘子。要是我回去的话，可能会发生糟糕的事。我已经不像以前那么恭敬了，我怕我会把那些茶杯和碟子都给砸碎了。

请原谅我得匆匆停笔不再谈最近的事了，因为我正在上法语课，我担心老师很快会叫到我。

果然，他叫我了。

再见，我爱您。

茱迪





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

您见过我们的校园吗？（这个疑问句只是用来修辞的，您不必在意。）五月的校园就像天堂，灌木丛开始萌芽，树木生出最可爱的新绿——甚至老松树看上去也鲜嫩而新生。几百个穿着蓝色、白色、粉色衣服的女孩子和黄色的蒲公英点缀着草地。因为假期临近，大家都是那么开心无忧，真希望没有考试这回事啊。

这是不是让人心情舒畅的氛围呢？哦，叔叔！所有人中最快乐的是我！因为我不用继续待在孤儿院了，我再不是谁的女仆、打字员或者图书管理员（要不是您的话，您知道的，我就会是）。

我为过去做错的事感到抱歉。

我很抱歉我以前对李佩特太太那么无礼。

我很抱歉我曾打了弗雷德·伯金斯几巴掌。

我很抱歉我把盐搁在糖碗里。

我很抱歉我在理事身后做鬼脸。

我会变好的，对每个人都亲切友好，因为我如此快乐。这个夏天，我要写、写、写，要开始当一个伟大的作家。这是不是很尊贵的一个职业呢？噢，我正在培养一种美丽的气质呢！在寒冷和冰霜中会凋零一点点，但在阳光的照耀下，它成长得很快。

人人都是这样。我不同意这样的理论：逆境、悲伤、失望能培养道德力量。快乐的人浑身洋溢着亲切和善，我对厌世者没有信心（好词！我刚学的）。您不是个厌世者，对吧，叔叔？

我要开始和你讲讲校园了。我希望您能来参观一小会儿，让我陪着您走走看看，告诉您：

“这里是图书馆。这个是煤气站。亲爱的叔叔，您左边的哥特式建筑是体育馆，它旁边的都铎王朝罗马式建筑是新的医务室。”

哦，我很擅长带人参观游览。在孤儿院里我总是带人参观，真的，不骗您，今天我还带人走了一天呢。



也是一个男人！

这是种奇妙体验。我之前从没有和男人讲过话，除非偶尔和理事说话，他们不能算。请原谅，叔叔，当我责怪理事的时候，并不想伤您的心。我没有认为您真的是他们中的一个。您不过是凑巧给绊了一跤，跌进了委员会。那些个理事肥头大耳、自命不凡，一脸乐善好施的模样，会轻轻地拍拍人家的脑袋，戴着条金表链。

看上去像只绿花金龟。这就是理事的形象。除了您以外。

好吧，言归正传：

我和一个男人散步、聊天、喝茶了呢。他是一个特别优秀的男人——茱莉娅家的杰维斯·彭德莱顿先生，是她的叔叔，简短地说（也许我应该说，细致地说。他有您那么高），他进城里办事，而后决定来看看学校和他的侄女。他是茱莉娅爸爸最小的弟弟。但是茱莉娅和他并不亲密。好像在茱莉娅还是小婴儿的时候他只看了她一眼，就决定不喜欢她了似的，从此以后他再也没有注意过她。

不管怎么样吧，当时他很有礼貌地坐在接待室里，帽子、手杖、手套放在一边。茱莉娅和萨莉的第七节课是朗诵课，不能缺席，所以茱莉娅冲进我的房间，求我陪他逛逛校园，等她的课结束再把他送回去。出于礼貌，我说可以，愿意帮忙但是又不怎么热情，因为我根本就不喜欢她家人。

不过他是个温和的年轻人。他是个有血有肉的人——不像彭德莱顿家的人。我们一起很愉快，从那之后我就希望自己也有个叔叔。您愿意假装我叔叔吗？我相信当叔叔总比当“奶奶”好。

彭德莱顿先生有点让我想起了您的模样。叔叔，您二十年前的样子。您瞧，尽管我们没见过面，但是我对您非常熟悉。

他高挑瘦削，脸色深而线条分明，还总藏着特别好玩的笑容，不过他从不纵情地笑，只会弯一弯嘴角。他那么友善，让人一见如故。

我们走遍了校园，从方形的中庭到运动场都走了一遍，而后他说他有点累了，想喝茶，他提议我们去学校酒店——只要穿过一条松间走道就到了。我说我们应该回去找茱莉娅和萨莉，但他说他不喜欢让他的侄女们喝太多茶，她们会变得神经兮兮的。于是我们就溜掉了，坐在外面阳台上一张小巧的桌子前喝茶，吃松饼和果酱，还有冰淇淋和蛋糕。酒店里空荡荡的，因为已经是月底了，大家都没有什么生活费了。

我们一起度过了最快乐的时光！但是他得赶火车回去，走的时候他只看了茱莉娅一眼，茱莉娅很生气我把他给拐跑了。看来他是个特别富有并且非常讨人喜欢的叔叔。不过，发现他很有钱我的心里就安慰了许多，因为那些茶和甜点每样都花掉了六十美分。

今天早上（星期一），快递寄来三盒巧克力，分别给我和萨莉、茱莉娅。您怎么想呢？一个男人送糖果给我！

我现在觉得自己是个女孩子，不再是个弃儿啦。

希望有一天您会来，喝喝茶，让我看看我是不是喜欢您。不过，如果我不喜欢您，那岂不是很可怕？不管怎么样吧，我知道我会喜欢您的。

好了，祝安康！

想念您的

茱迪

5月30日

又及：今天早上我照镜子的时候发现了一个新酒窝，我以前从来没有见过。我很好奇。您觉得它是从哪里来的？





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

今天真高兴！我刚刚结束了最后一科生理学的考试。接下来呢：

去农场待三个月！

不知道农场是什么样子的。我以前从没去过，甚至都没见过呢（除了透过车窗看到以外），不过我知道我会爱上它的，我会爱上自由自在的感觉。

我不经常出约翰·格里尔之家的大门。每次有这种念头的时候，一阵微微的战栗就会悄然升起，又沿着我的后背落下去。我必须得跑快点，再快一点，不停地回头望，确定李佩特太太没有跟在我后头伸出手来抓我回去。

这个暑假，我不需要在乎谁，对吗？

我一点也不害怕您名义上的权威，您太远了，根本伤害不到我。李佩特太太永远地死了，我不用在乎她了，森普尔一家也不负责监管我的道德修养吧？不可能的，我肯定这是不会发生的。我已经完全地长大了，这真是太好了！

我现在就去收拾旅行箱，还有三个箱子装茶壶、盘子、沙发垫和书。

您永远的

茱迪

6月9日

又及：还有，您认为您会通过生理学考试吗？





最亲爱的长腿叔叔：

我刚刚到，还没有把行李打开，但是我等不及了，我要告诉您我有多喜欢农场。这是个天堂一般、天堂一般、天堂一般的地方。宅子是方的，像这样：



很古老，差不多有一百年了，边上的游廊我画不出来，前头还有漂亮的门廊。画得不好，没能描绘出原本的模样——那些看上去像鸡毛掸子的是枫树，在车道边上长刺的是沙沙作响的松树和铁杉。这个农场坐落在山顶，放眼望去，宽阔的草地绵延了好几英里，一直到与另外几个山坡相接的地方。



康涅狄格州就是这样的，像一串串烫发的波浪；罗克维罗农场在其中一个波浪的顶端。谷仓以前在路的另一头，会遮挡视线，也许是从天而降的一束闪电将它们夷为了平地。

住在这里的有森普尔先生和太太，还雇了一个女孩子，以及两个男人帮工。帮工在厨房吃饭，森普尔一家和茱迪在饭厅里吃。我们吃了火腿、鸡蛋、饼干、蜂蜜、果冻蛋糕、馅饼、腌渍食品，晚饭还有奶酪和茶，我们说了很多很多的话。我这辈子从来没有受到如此热情的款待过，我讲的每一句话都似乎很好笑，我估计这是因为我从来没到过乡下的缘故。我的问题都十分蠢。

图中标着X的房间不是执行死刑的地方，而是我住的房间。它很大很宽敞很空，摆的都是可爱的老式家具，还有用棍子撑着的老式窗户，镶着金边的绿色百叶窗一碰就落下来了。以及一张红木的大方桌。我准备摊开胳膊在这张桌子上度过暑假——写一部小说。

噢，叔叔，我真是太兴奋了！等天亮我要去四处转转，我都迫不及待了。这会儿是八点半，我得熄灭蜡烛睡觉了，我们五点钟要起床。您曾有过这样的快乐吗？我都不能相信这是茱迪了。您和仁慈的主给我的，远远超过我应得的。为了报答您，我一定要成为非常非常非常好的人。我会成为这样的人的，您会看到这一天。

晚安。

茱迪

星期六晚

于罗克维罗农场

及：您真该听听蛙鸣，还有小猪的尖叫声。您也该看看那轮新月！我看到它就在我的右肩上空。





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

您的秘书是怎么知道罗克维罗的？（这不是客套话，我实在是很好奇。）听听这个吧，这家农场原本属于杰维斯·彭德莱顿先生，不过现在他把农场给森普尔太太了。她以前是他的老保姆。您之前听说过这么好玩的巧合吗？她还是叫他杰维少爷，说他以前是个很可爱的小男孩。她还有一束他小时候的鬈发，就放在盒子里，是红色的——至少是浅红色的！

当她知道我认识杰维斯先生的时候，我的地位在她的眼里立刻提高了许多。在罗克维罗农场，认识彭德莱顿家的人是最好的引见了。杰维少爷是这一家人的骄傲，我很高兴茱莉娅属于另一脉相对低劣的分支。

农场越来越好玩了。昨天我坐了拉干草的马车。我们有三头大猪，还有九头小猪崽！您真该看看它们吃东西的样子！它们确实是猪！我们有成群的小鸡、小鸭、小火鸡、小珍珠鸡。要是你能住在农场却偏偏要住在城里，那可真是发疯呢。

我的日常工作就是到处去捡鸡蛋。昨天，我想爬到一只黑鸡偷偷躲起来的地方，结果从谷仓阁楼的横梁上掉了下来。我拖着刮伤的膝盖走进屋时，森普尔太太一边用金丝梅酊剂给我包扎，一边还喃喃地说：“天哪，天哪！杰维少爷也从那根横梁上跌下来过，刮伤的也是这个膝盖，这事好像就发生在昨天一样！”

附近的风景真是美极了。山谷、河流、大片树木繁茂的山坡、远方的小路、高高的蓝色山脉鲜嫩得像是能入口即化一样。

我们每个星期要拌两次奶油，然后就把奶油放在冷藏室。冷藏室是石头砌的，屋子底下有一条奔流的小溪。附近的农民都用脱脂器，但我们不喜欢这种新鲜时髦的玩意儿。锅拌奶油需要照看，可能有点儿烦人，然而回报是值得的。还有六头小牛犊，我替它们取了名字：

一、西尔维娅，因为她是在树林中出生的(10)。

二、丽斯比雅，根据卡塔路斯的丽斯比雅取的名字。

三、萨莉。

四、茱莉娅——一头有斑点、没有什么特点的牛。

五、茱迪，我的名字。

六、长腿叔叔。您不会介意吧，叔叔？这是头纯种泽西乳牛，性情温顺。它长这个样子——您明白这名字有多么合适了。



我一直没时间动手写我那不朽的小说呢，农场让我忙得不亦乐乎。

您永远的

茱迪

7月12日

于罗克维罗

及：

一、我学会做油炸圈圈了。

二、要是您想养鸡的话，我建议养奥尔平顿鸡，它们腿上不长幼毛。

三、我想送给您一块上好的新鲜奶油，是我昨天做的。我是个优秀的挤奶女工哦！

四、一张杰瑞莎·艾伯特小姐的画，未来的伟大作家正在赶牛回家。

我不会赶牛！





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

好玩吧？昨天下午我就开始给您写信了，但是只写了头一句“亲爱的长腿叔叔”，就想起来我许诺为晚餐采黑莓，然后就出去了，把信纸摆在桌子上。今天回来继续写的时候，您猜我在信纸中间发现了什么？一只真正的“长腿叔叔”！



我非常轻柔地拎起它的一条腿，把它扔到了窗外。我不会伤害它们的，它们总让我想到您。

我们今天早上套了一辆马车，然后驾车去了城中心的教堂。那是座很美的白色框架小教堂，尖顶，前面有三根多利安式圆柱（或许爱奥尼亚式的吧，我总是把这两种弄混了）。

一场温和而令人犯困的布道，每个人都拿着棕榈叶当扇子昏昏欲睡，唯一的声音就来自牧师，外面树上的蝉在嗡嗡鸣叫着。我一直打着瞌睡，直到站起来唱赞美诗。我真的非常抱歉我没听布道。我真想知道选了这样一首赞美诗的男人是什么心理。您看：

来吧，放弃你的竞技和世俗玩具

来到我天堂的欢乐之中

否则，亲爱的朋友，你我就此永别

由你落进地狱

我发现和森普尔一家谈论宗教不妥当。他们的上帝（他们是从遥远的清教徒祖先那儿原封不动地继承下来的）是个心胸狭隘、毫无理性、远失公平、性情卑劣、心怀仇恨、顽固不化的人。感谢天主，我没从任何人那里继承个上帝！我可以随心所欲地建构他。他善良、富有同情心和想象力，宽容并且体谅人——有幽默感。

我很喜欢森普尔一家。他们的实践远远超过了理论，他们自己比他们的上帝强多了。我就是这么告诉他们的，他们被我的话弄得很不安，认为我这是在亵渎神明——我认为他们才是！从此我们不再讨论神学内容了。

这会儿是星期天下午了。

阿马塞（男雇工）打着紫领带，戴着明亮的黄色鹿皮手套，红光满面，还刮了胡子，刚刚驾着马车和凯莉（女雇工）出去又回来了。凯莉戴着一顶缀着红玫瑰的大帽子，穿了一条蓝色的细布裙，头发紧紧地盘着。阿马塞擦洗了一个早上的马车，凯莉从教堂回来就假装在准备晚饭，其实是在烫她那条细布裙子。

两分多钟以后，这封信写完了，我准备看一本在阳台上发现的叫《在小路上》的书，一个小男孩乱七八糟的笔迹在扉页上写着：

杰维斯·彭德莱顿，

要是这本书四处乱跑，

请扭着它的耳朵把它送回家。

他生病之后在这里过了一个暑假，那时候他大约十一岁，《在小路上》被留在了这里。看上去他很仔细地读过这本书——污糟糟的小手留下的痕迹到处都是！阳台角落里还有水车、风车和一些弓箭。森普尔太太总把他挂在嘴边，所以我开始觉得他不像是戴着丝绸帽子、拄着手杖的成年男人，而是一个可爱、邋遢、头发乱七八糟的男孩子，总是咔嗒咔嗒上楼梯，拿着个大球拍，纱门也不关，总想要饼干吃（我知道他会得逞的，我了解森普尔太太）。他似乎有一个喜爱冒险的灵魂，勇敢而且诚实。我一想起来他是彭德莱顿家的人就觉得遗憾，他比他们好多了。

我们准备明天开始给麦子脱粒，备好了一台蒸汽机，还有另外三个工人。

告诉你下面这个消息我很难过，芭特卡普（一只角上满是斑点的奶牛，丽斯比雅的妈妈）做了件很丢人的事情。星期五晚上它跑到了果园里，在树底下吃苹果，它吃呀吃呀，结果整整两天它都是醉得晕晕的。我讲的是真事，你有没有听过这种丢脸的事情？

先生，我依然是挚爱您的孤儿

茱迪·艾伯特

又及：书中第一章讲印第安人，第二章讲拦路抢劫的强盗。我屏住了呼吸，第三章会是什么呢？卷首上写着：“红鹰跃起二十英尺，重重落在地上。”茱迪和杰维能不被逗乐吗？





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

我昨天在街角的百货店的面粉秤上称了称体重。我胖了九磅！我推荐大家来罗克维罗休养！

您永远的

茱迪

9月15日





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

拥抱我吧——我大二了！我是上个星期五回来的，真不想离开罗克维罗啊，但是还是很高兴能再见到校园，回到熟悉的环境感觉真好。因为熟悉了情况，我开始感觉学校像是我的家了。实际上我开始觉得这个世界像个家园了——虽然我本来就属于它，并不是偷偷摸摸溜进来的。

我不认为您真的理解我想说的话，一个贵为理事的人，是不会理解卑微的弃儿的。

现在，叔叔，来听听这个。您猜我和谁一起住？萨莉·迈克布莱德，还有茱莉娅·彭德莱顿。真的。我们有一间书房，还有三间小卧室——瞧！



去年的春天，我和萨莉就觉得我们应该住在一起，而茱莉娅也决心要和萨莉在一起——我真不明白为什么，她们根本就没有共同之处，彭德莱顿家的人生来保守而且不友善（真是好词）！无论如何吧，我们这样住了。想想吧，杰瑞莎·艾伯特，之前是约翰·格里尔之家的孤儿，现在和彭德莱顿家的人住在一间屋子里。这真是个民主的国家呀。

萨莉正在竞选班长，所有的迹象都表明她一定会当选。这种充满诡计的氛围——您真该看看，我们都成政治家了！哦，我告诉您，叔叔，当我们女性得到属于自己的权利时，你们男人就得留神保住你们的权利。下个星期六就选举了，不管谁当选，我们晚上都要举行火炬游行的。

我开始学化学了，这门学科不同寻常，我以前从没见过这样的学科。现在正在学分子和原子，下个月我能更详细地跟您谈论这些问题了。

我也在学辩论和逻辑学。

还有世界历史。

还有莎士比亚戏剧。

还有法语。

如果能多学几年，我会变得非常聪明的。

其实相对于选修法语，我更愿意选经济学，不过我不敢，我担心要是我再不选修法语，教授可能不让我通过——会的，六月的考试我就是勉强通过的，不过得说是我高中的基础没打好。

班上有个女孩，她说起法语来叽叽喳喳的，跟说英语一样的流利。她小时候和父母一起出国了，在教会学校待了三年。您可以想象的，相比其他女孩子她有多聪明——不规则动词对她来说就像玩一样。真希望我的父母在我小的时候，也把我丢在法国修道院，而不是孤儿院啊。噢，不，那我也不愿意。因为如果那样的话，也许我就不会认识您了。我宁可不会说法语也要认识您。

再见，叔叔。我现在要去找哈里特·马丁，我们要讨论化学课，顺便聊聊下届班长的事。

您正在玩政治的

茱迪·艾伯特

9月25日





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

假设体育馆游泳池里全是柠檬汁，一个人在里面游泳的话，他会沉下去还是浮在水面上？

提出这个问题时，我们正在喝柠檬汁。我们激烈地讨论了半个小时，但还是没能想出答案来。萨莉觉得她可以在里面游泳，但我百分之百肯定就算是世界上最好的游泳运动员也会沉下去。在柠檬汁里淹死是不是很好玩？

我们还讨论了另外两个问题。

第一，一座八角形的房子，里面的房间会是什么形状？有些女孩坚持说是方的，但是我觉得它们会是馅饼的形状。您觉得是不是呢？

第二，假设您坐在一个由镜子做成的空心球体里面，哪个位置是照到后背而照不到脸的呢？越想这个问题，人就越糊涂。您这下就能明白了，我们课余时间关心的哲学问题有多么深刻！



选举的事我告诉过您吗？三个星期前选过了，日子过得这么快，三个星期都已经变成古老的历史了。萨莉当选，我们举行了一场火炬游行，我们举着“萨莉万岁”的横幅，还有一支由十四样东西（三把口琴和十一把梳子）组成的乐队。

现在我们都是258室的重要人物啦，茱莉娅和我因此得到了极大的荣耀。不过，和班长住在一起也是一种很大的社会压力呢。

晚安，亲爱的叔叔。

请接受我的敬意。

尊敬您的

茱迪

亲爱的长腿叔叔：

在昨天的篮球比赛中，我们打败了大一的新生。我们当然是很开心的喽——不过，要是我们能打败大三学生的话就更好了！要真是那样的话，身上又青又紫，敷着金丝缕梅酊剂，在床上待一个礼拜我也愿意。

萨莉邀请我和她一起过圣诞节。她住在马萨诸塞州的伍斯特。她友好吧？我会很高兴去的。我还从来没去过别人家呢，只去过罗克维罗，不过森普尔夫妇是一对老夫妇，不能算。迈克这一家有一屋子的孩子（两个或者三个），还有爸爸、妈妈、奶奶，以及一只安哥拉猫。这是一个完美的家庭！收拾行李、远走高飞比留在这里有意思多了。这美妙的前景让我兴奋极了。

第七节课，我得赶紧去排练。我要参加感恩节的演出，我演一个住在塔里的王子，一头金黄色的卷发，穿着天鹅绒束腰外衣，有意思吧？

您的

茱迪·艾伯特

11月12日

您想知道我长什么样儿吗？这是我们三个人的照片，莱昂纳多·芬顿拍的。

那个笑得很明亮的是萨莉，个子高一点、鼻子冲着天的是茱莉娅，头发被吹到脸上的小个头是茱迪——其实她比照片漂亮，不过太阳晃得她睁不开眼睛。

星期六





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

本来我想早点给您写信，顺便感谢您的圣诞节支票，但是迈克布莱德的家庭生活处处都那么吸引人，我简直没办法在桌子前头稳稳坐上两分钟。

我新买了一件长外套，并不是因为必需，只是因为我想要。今年的圣诞礼物是长腿叔叔送的，家人只表达了爱意。

我在萨莉家度过了一个最美好的假期。她的家是一幢老式的砖房子，沿街那一面贴着白边——正是我在约翰·格里尔之家的时候好奇地打量过的那种房子。我一直想知道里面的样子，但从来没想到能够亲眼看见——现在我已经在里头了！一切都是那么舒服、恬静，就像在家里一样，我从一个房间走到另一个房间，仔细地欣赏屋内的陈设。

对孩子来说，这是一栋最完美的房子了，有可以捉迷藏的被阴影覆盖的隐秘地方，也有敞开的火炉可以爆米花，雨天可以在阳台上蹦蹦跳跳，在光滑的楼梯扶栏底下有个很舒服的扁平把手，厨房宽敞、阳光充裕，还有一个手艺精湛、性格开朗的胖厨娘，她在这个家里已经十三年了，总是会留一块面团让孩子们烘烤。光是看到这房子，你就会想再回到童年。

我从来没有想到过，原来家有这么美好。萨莉有爸爸、妈妈、奶奶，还有个满头鬈发的三岁的小妹妹，可爱极了。她还有个中等个头的弟弟，他老忘记把鞋子擦干净。另外有个大个头的哥哥叫杰米，是普林斯顿大学三年级的学生。

我们最快乐的时光是在饭桌上——每个人都在笑，大家开着玩笑，不必饭前祷告。不用每吃一口饭都要谢谢谁真是让人放松。我敢说自己一定在亵渎神灵，但是如果您像我一样，之前不得不说了那么多千恩万谢的话，你就会有和我一样的感受了。

我们做了很多事——我就不提这些了。迈克布莱德先生开了一家工厂，圣诞节他给雇员的孩子们准备了一棵树，树就搁在长长的打包间里，房间装饰着常青藤和冬青树，杰米打扮成圣诞老人，我和萨莉帮忙分发礼物。

天哪，叔叔，这种感受多有意思！觉得自己是施舍的人，正如约翰·格里尔的理事们做的那样。我吻了一个甜美的、黏糊糊的小男孩——但是我没拍他们任何一个的脑袋！

圣诞节两天之后，他们在家里为我开了一场舞会。

这是我第一次参加真正的舞会——大学里是和女孩子跳舞，不算。我有一件白色的新晚礼服（是您的圣诞节礼物——万分感谢），有白色长手套、白色缎子鞋。我沉浸在极度完美和幸福之中，唯一的美中不足就是李佩特太太不在场，没能看到我和杰米领着大家跳交谊舞。拜托您下次去约翰·格里尔之家的时候告诉她吧。

您永远的

茱迪·艾伯特

马萨诸塞州，伍斯特，“石门”

及：要是我没能成为一个伟大作家，只是一个普普通通的女孩，您会不会大失所望呢？





亲爱的叔叔：

我们今天动身往城里走，然而天可怜见，我们遇上了倾盆大雨。我喜欢冬天下雪，不喜欢下雨。

今天下午茱莉娅那个人见人爱的叔叔又来了，带了一盒五磅的巧克力。你看，和茱莉娅住在一起多好啊。

我们天真的叽叽喳喳好像把他逗乐了，他是为了留在书房里喝杯茶而误了火车。我们费了很大劲儿才得到校方同意。在宿舍招待爸爸、爷爷都很困难，叔叔就更难了，至于兄弟、堂兄弟丝毫可能也没有了。茱莉娅只好在公证员的面前发誓，还得附上家乡官员的公证书来证明他们之间的关系。（我是不是懂很多法律？）即便如此，我也怀疑，要是我们的系主任看见杰维斯叔叔这么年轻，而且还很好看，我们就不能一起喝茶了。

无论如何吧，我们还是喝到了茶，吃了黑面包、瑞士奶酪三明治，是他帮我们做的，还一口气吃了四块。我告诉他暑假我是在罗克维罗过的，我们很开心地聊了森普尔一家，还有马、牛、鸡。他之前知道的马都已经死了，只有格罗弗还在，他最后一趟去的时候它还只是头小马驹呢——可怜的格罗弗现在都那么老了，它只能在牧草地上四处一瘸一拐地走。

他问我森普尔他们的油炸圈是不是还放在黄色的罐子里，用蓝色的盘子盖住，搁在餐具橱的最底层——真的，就是这样的！他还问我晚上的时候，牧场的石头堆底下有没有土拨鼠洞——有的！阿马塞今年夏天抓到了一只胖胖大大的灰色土拨鼠，是杰维少爷小时候抓到的那只的第二十五代子孙。

我当面叫他“杰维少爷”，他没生气。茱莉娅说，她从来没有见过他这么和蔼可亲，他平常是相当不可亲近的。不过，茱莉娅太不机敏了，而男人要求别人很机敏，要是你顺毛摸，他们就会喵喵叫，否则，他们就会吐口水。（这个比喻并不恰当，我只是象征性比喻一下。）

我们正在读玛丽亚·巴西柯塞夫(11)的日记。很有意思吧？您听听这段：“昨天晚上，一阵绝望抓住了我，我开始是不断地发牢骚，而后就把饭厅的钟扔进了大海。”

我真希望我不是天才，有这些人在身边真是种折磨——他们对家具具有破坏性。

上帝保佑！雨下得像是瓢泼下来的一样。我们今天要游泳去教堂了。



您永远的

茱迪

星期六6时30分





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

您是不是有过一个甜美的小女儿，小的时候被人从摇篮里偷走了？

可能就是我！如果是小说，这就是结尾，对吗？

这真是种古怪的感觉，不知道自己是谁——让人觉得兴奋又浪漫，有太多的可能，也许我根本不是美国人，很多人都不是呢。也许我是古罗马人的后裔，也许我是维京海盗的女儿，也可能是俄罗斯流放犯的孩子，他们被西伯利亚监狱管着，或许我是个吉卜赛人——我认为可能真的是这样，我喜欢流浪，尽管我还没有机会发扬这样的精神。

您知道不知道？我的经历中有一个很大的污点——从孤儿院逃跑。因为我偷饼干他们处罚了我。这事就记在楼下的一个本子里，每个理事都可以自行查阅。事情是真的，叔叔，但是这怎么能怪我呢？把一个饿着肚子的九岁小女孩放在餐具室里洗餐刀，饼干筒就放在她的眼前，人都走了，只剩她一个人在那里。然后他们突然跳了进来，难道还指望着不在她身上发现饼干屑？狠狠地拽住她的胳膊，扭着她的耳朵，大家都在吃布丁却让她离开饭桌，还告诉其他的孩子，这都因为她是小偷。您不认为她该逃跑吗？

我只跑了四英里。他们就抓住了我，把我带了回去。整整一个星期我都被拴着，像只调皮的小狗，别的孩子休息玩耍，而我就在后院里像树桩一样竖着。

噢，老天！做礼拜的钟声响了，做完礼拜我要去参加学生会议。对不起，我本来想的是给你写一封非常有趣的信的。

再见

亲爱的叔叔

平安。

茱迪

1月20日

及：不过有一点我非常肯定。我不是中国人。





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

杰米送给我一面普林斯顿大学的校旗，有我房间的一面墙那么大。我真的很感激他能记得我，不过我不知道用它来做什么。萨莉和茱莉娅不会让我挂在房间里的，今年我们的房间布置成红色的，你可以想象要是再加橘色和黑色会是什么效果。不过旗子真的不错，温暖、质地优良，我讨厌浪费，把它做成浴袍是不是不太合适？我以前的那件已经洗缩水了。



最近我忘记告诉您我的学习情况了。尽管您从我的信里看不出来，但我的时间还是被学习占满的，要同时学五门课把我弄昏了头。

“真正的学者，”化学教授说，“对细节问题都不会放过。”

“你们的眼睛不要只盯着细节。”历史教授说，“站得远一些才能看清全局。”

您看，我们只能在化学与历史间见风使舵了。我比较喜欢历史学方法。要是我说威廉一世1492年征服了英国，哥伦布在1100年或1066年或者随便什么时候发现了美洲，这都是教授会忽略掉的微小细节，这样背起历史来，就有一种安全又放松的感觉，而化学课完全不行。

第六节课的钟响了——我必须去实验室研究酸、盐、碱啦。化学课的围裙前摆让我烧出了一个盘子大的洞，是盐酸烧的。如果理论真的有用，我应该能用氨水把这个洞给中和了，对不对？

下个星期考试，谁怕呢？

您永远的

茱迪

2月4日





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

三月的风吹起来了，天空中满是重重的黑色云团。松树间的乌鸦叫个不停。那声音让人陶醉，像一声声的召唤撩拨着我的心弦。我真想合上书本，走出门，去山上和风儿赛跑。

上个星期六，我们在五英里内的泥泞乡间玩撒纸追踪的游戏，狐狸（三个女孩扮的，她们带了差不多一蒲式耳的五彩纸屑）比二十七个猎人提前出发半个小时。我是二十七猎手之一，结果我们半路上丢了八个人，只剩了十九个猎手。纸屑引着我们翻过了一座山，穿过了玉米地，到了沼泽，在那里我们只好从一块高地跳到另一块高地上去。自然一半的人都被沼泽里的水弄湿了脚踝。我们又失去了她们的踪迹，在沼泽里浪费了二十五分钟，然后我们过了树林，爬上了一座小山，看到了一扇谷仓窗户！谷仓的门都上了锁，窗户很高很小。她们可真狡猾，您说是不是？

不过我们没进去，而是绕过谷仓，纸屑穿过一个低矮的棚子，到了一处篱笆顶上。“狐狸先生”们以为把我们难住了，不过没有。又走了两英里连绵起伏的草地，路更难找了，彩屑太分散了，本来游戏规则是纸屑的最大间距是六英尺，但我还是第一次见这么长的六英尺呢。后来，经过两个钟头的艰苦跋涉，我们终于在“水晶春天”的厨房里找到了“狐狸先生”们（水晶春天是一座农场，女孩子们坐雪橇或拉干草的马车来享受晚餐，这里吃鸡和华夫饼）。我们发现这三位“狐狸先生”正静静地喝蜂蜜牛奶，吃着点心。她们压根儿没想到我们会走这么远，以为我们还在谷仓的窗口盯着呢。

双方都坚持是自己赢了。我觉得是我们赢了，您怎么看呢？因为我们回学校之前就抓到她们了呀。不管怎么样，我们十九个人坐下来就跟知了一样吵着要吃蜂蜜。因为蜂蜜不够那么多人分，“水晶春天太太”（这是我们给她的昵称，她姓约翰逊）又拿来一罐草莓酱、一罐槭糖浆——上个星期刚做的——还拿了三条黑面包。

我们六点半才回到学校，晚饭时间已经过了半小时。我们没换衣服就跑去了餐厅，胃口丝毫没受影响！而后大家晚上的礼拜都没去，理由很充足，我们的靴子沾满了泥巴。

考试的事情我还没有告诉您呢，我很轻松地通过了所有考试——明白了其中的奥秘，我以后再也不会挂科了，尽管我不大可能以优异的成绩毕业，因为大一时讨厌的拉丁文和几何没及格。不过我不在乎。心存喜乐，无以为忧。（这是引用的，我最近在读英国古典文学。）

讲到古典文学，您有没有读过《哈姆雷特》？如果没有的话，那么现在就读吧，真是美极了。我总是听人说莎士比亚，然而从来不知道他写得有这么好呢。我还以为他是徒有虚名呢。

很久很久以前，当我刚学着阅读的时候，我发明了一种美妙的游戏，睡觉的时候想象着自己是正在读的那本书里最重要的人物。

现在我是奥菲莉娅——多么明智的奥菲莉娅！我逗哈姆雷特开心，宠爱他，责备他，在他感冒的时候为他披上围巾，我完全治好了他的抑郁症。国王和王后都死了——海难事故就用不着葬礼了——我和哈姆雷特没有任何麻烦，顺利地统治着丹麦。这片土地我们管理得很好。他管理国事，而我则主持慈善事业。我刚刚建了些一流的孤儿院。如果您和哪个理事想去看看，我会很高兴带你们转转的。我想你们一定会发现有很多对你们也有用的举措。

先生，我仍是您最优雅的

丹麦王后 奥菲莉娅

亲爱的长腿叔叔：

我想我是上不了天堂的——在这里我已经得到了这么多的好东西，再上天堂就不公平了。听听都有什么事吧。

杰瑞莎·艾伯特在《月刊》杂志年度短篇小说竞赛中获奖（奖金25美元）！而她只是个大二学生！大部分参赛者都是大四学生。当我看见自己的名字被贴出来的时候，简直不敢相信这是真的。我以后可能真的会是个作家。我真希望李佩特太太给我取的名字没这么傻——一听就像个女作家，对吗？

还有，我入选参加春季的戏剧节——演《皆大欢喜》(12)中的西莉娅，罗斯兰的表妹。

最后，茱莉娅、萨莉和我，下个星期五要去纽约待一个晚上，去买春季的衣服。第二天的早上和杰维少爷一起看戏。是他邀请了我们。茱莉娅回家住，萨莉和我住在马撒·华盛顿酒店。您听过这么令人开心的事吗？我以前从没住过酒店，也没去过戏院，除了有一次天主教堂举办活动请孤儿们参加。但那根本不是真正的戏剧，不能算。

您猜猜我们要看什么戏？《哈姆雷特》。真好啊！我们学了四个星期《哈姆雷特》，我已经把整个剧本背下来了。

所有这些都让我兴奋得难以入睡。

再见，叔叔。

这真是个非常友爱的世界。

您永远的

茱迪

3月24日或25日

及：我刚看了一下日历，今天是28号。




又及：我今天见到一名电车售票员，一只眼睛是棕色的，另一只眼睛是蓝色的。他合适演侦探故事里的恶棍，对吗？





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

天哪！纽约太大了呀！相比之下，伍斯特简直微不足道。您真的住在这么一个混乱的地方？我只住了两天，但要花好几个月才能从那种头晕目眩的感觉中恢复过来。我不知道怎么跟您讲那些令人吃惊的事情，不过我猜您是知道的，因为您就在纽约住。

那些街道很有意思，还有人和商店。我之前从没见过橱窗里会有这么多可爱的东西。这会让你把一生都花在穿戴上。

萨莉、茱莉娅和我星期六早上一起去购物了。茱莉娅进的一家店——是我所见过的最豪华的店。白色和金色的墙、蓝色的地毯，还有蓝色的丝绸帘子，椅子是镀金的。一位漂亮的金发女士穿了一件长长的黑色曳尾丝绸长袍微笑着欢迎我们。我差点以为是社交活动，要握握手呢，但是我们只是来买顶帽子罢了——至少茱莉娅买了。她坐在镜子前试了一打，一顶比一顶美，然后她买了最可爱的两顶。

坐到镜子前，不需要考虑价钱就把你自己喜欢的帽子买下来，我想不出还有比这更快乐的事了！我深深地相信，叔叔，纽约很快就会摧毁约翰·格里尔之家一片苦心培养出来的清心寡欲的信念。

买完东西，我们在雪莉饭店见到了杰维少爷。我想那里您也去过的吧。想想那里的样子，再想想约翰·格里尔之家的餐厅——盖着油布的桌子、打不碎的白色器皿、木把手的刀叉，我是什么感觉您就可想而知了吧！

吃鱼的时候，我用错了叉子，好心的侍者又给了我一把，所以没有人注意到。

吃完午餐我们去了戏院——眼花缭乱、不可思议、难以置信——我每天都梦见它。

莎士比亚是不是很伟大？

舞台上的《哈姆雷特》比我们在课堂上分析得精彩多了，我以前就很喜欢它，但是现在，我的天哪！

我想，要是您不介意的话，我会更愿意当女演员而不是作家呢，您愿意我离开学校到戏剧学院读书吗？我所有的演出都会送您包厢，我会在舞台上冲您微笑。请您只要在衣服扣眼上别一枝红玫瑰，这样我就肯定不会认错人了。认错了人，太难为情了。

我们是星期六晚上回来的，在火车上吃的晚饭，小桌子上都亮着粉红色的灯，还有黑人侍者。我以前从没听说火车上还有晚餐，而且我不小心把这个给说出来了。

“你到底在哪里长大的？”茱莉娅当时就问我了。

“一个村庄。”我镇定地对她说。

“但你没旅行过吗？”她又说。

“上大学前没有。再说只有一百六十英里，我们用不着吃饭。”我对她说。

她由此对我产生了极大的好奇和兴趣，因为我的话很滑稽。我努力不让自己这样，但一惊奇话就冒出来了——而让我感到惊奇的新鲜事又太多。叔叔，在约翰·格里尔之家度过了十八年，而后突然被扔在世界上，真让人晕头转向。

但是我正在适应环境。我再也没犯过以前那么可笑的错误了，我和别人在一起时也不会觉得不舒服了。以前别人看我时，我总是不安地乱动，我总觉得她们会透过我的新衣服看到里面的花格布，但是现在，我再也不会因为花格布而忧虑了。不要再为了昨天而烦忧。

忘记告诉您我的花儿了。杰维少爷送给我们每人一大束紫罗兰和野百合。他是不是太好了？我以前从来不关心男人——因为对理事们的印象——但是，现在，我改变想法了。

十一页了！这封信太长！不要害怕，我现在就停笔。

您永远的

茱迪

4月7日





亲爱的大富翁先生：

随信附上您的五十美元支票。非常感谢您。但是我觉得我不能接受，我的零用钱已经足够我买需要的帽子了。我真是抱歉我写了那些关于帽子店的傻话给您，我只是因为以前没见过。

不管怎么样，我不是在乞讨！我不能再接受更多额外的恩泽了。

您忠诚的

杰瑞莎·艾伯特

最亲爱的叔叔：

您能够原谅我昨天的信吗？寄了以后我就后悔了，想把它拿回来，但是那个粗鲁的邮递员不肯还给我。

这会儿已经是半夜了，好几个钟头我都很清醒，我觉得自己真是条虫子——一条千足虫——这是我能说的最糟糕的话了。我轻轻地关上通向书房的门，怕惊醒了茱莉娅和萨莉，从历史笔记本上撕下一页纸坐在床上给您写信。

我只是想告诉您我很抱歉，对您的那张支票我表现得很没礼貌。我知道您是好心好意，我想您为了一顶帽子这种小事这么费心，我本应该心存感激地把它还给您。

但是，不管怎么样，我都是应该还给您的。我和其他女孩子的态度不一样，她们可以理所当然地接受别人给的东西，她们有爸爸、兄弟、姑姑、叔叔，然而我和任何人都没关系。我可以想象您属于我，但这不过是和自己玩的游戏罢了。当然，我知道这不是真的。我一个人，真的，一个人面对这个世界——想到这里，就有点心惊！但我不放在心上，一直在假装着假装着。不过，您明白的，我不能接受额外的钱，对吗？因为总有一天，我是要还这些钱的，就算成了作家那样了不起的人，我也没法还清这笔十分庞大的债务。

我喜欢那些漂亮的帽子和物件，但我不能用自己的未来做抵押。

您能谅解我的，是吗，虽然我这么粗鲁？我有个很糟糕的习惯，我想到什么就冲动地写下来，未经三思就寄出去了。有时候我考虑不周，很失态，但我并不是有意的。我心里会永远地感激您，因为我的生命、自由和独立都是您赐予的。我的童年只是一段漫长的、阴沉的反抗之路，而现在我每天每时每刻都这么开心，都不敢相信它是真的，我感觉自己就像是书中虚构的女主角呢。

现在已经是两点一刻了，我打算踮着脚尖去邮箱那儿，把信寄出去。您收到那封信之后就会收到这封，这样您就不会很长时间都想着我的不好了。

晚安，叔叔。

永远爱您的

茱迪

亲爱的长腿叔叔：

上周六举行运动会，场面很壮观。先是所有的班级绕场游行，大家都穿着白色亚麻上衣，大四的学生打着蓝色、金色相间的日本伞，大三学生扛着白黄横幅。我们班的同学牵着红气球——相当迷人，特别是她们手一松气球就飞走的时候。大一学生戴着绿色的棉纸帽，帽子上还有长长的飘带。另外，我们还有乐队，她们穿的是从城里租来的蓝色制服。还有十二个专门逗乐的人，就像马戏团的小丑那样在比赛间隙给人们逗逗乐。

茱莉娅化装成一个乡下胖子，穿着亚麻防尘服，粘着络腮胡子，拿了一把松垮垮的伞。帕特丝·玛丽蒂（实际上是帕特里夏，你听过这种名字吗？就连李佩特太太也做不到这种地步），高高瘦瘦的，扮成茱莉娅的太太，用可笑的绿色女帽盖住她一只耳朵。她们走到哪里都是笑声一片。茱莉娅的表演得相当出色。我做梦也没有想到彭德莱顿家的人还有喜剧细胞——求杰维少爷原谅我吧，我从来没把他当成彭德莱顿家的人，就像也没把您当作真正的理事一样。

萨莉和我没有参加游行，因为我们要参加比赛。您猜怎么样？我们都赢啦！至少有的项目赢了。我们参加了跳远，输了；不过，萨莉的撑竿跳（七英尺三英寸）赢了，我赢的是五十米短跑（八秒）。

跑到最后我气喘吁吁的，但是全班同学都摇着气球欢呼尖叫，很好玩呢。我听见她们喊：

“茱迪·艾伯特怎么样？”

“她很棒。”

“谁很棒？”

“茱迪·艾伯特。”

茱迪赢了五十米短跑



叔叔，这是真正的荣耀。之后我冲进了换衣服的帐篷，她们用酒精帮我擦身子，我拿只柠檬吮吸着。你瞧我们做得多么专业。能为班级赢得一项比赛太好了。赢得最多的班级可以得到年度体育奖杯。今年是大三赢了，她们一共赢了七场比赛。体委在体育馆里宴请了所有获胜的选手。我们吃了烤软壳蟹、篮球形状的巧克力冰淇淋。

昨天，我坐了半夜读《简·爱》。叔叔，您还没老到能回忆六十年前的事吧？如果您记得的话，那时候是这么说话的吗？

傲慢的布兰奇小姐对男仆说：“停止你的闲聊，无赖，按我的吩咐做。”罗切斯特先生说到天空时，措辞是“金属般的苍穹”。那个疯女人笑起来像土狼，她把床帘点着了，撕碎了婚纱，撕咬——这是最纯粹的情节剧了，尽管是这样，你还是会继续看下去。我不明白怎么会有个姑娘写出这样的书来，特别是教区长大的姑娘。勃朗特一家真让我着迷。她们的书、她们的生活，还有她们的精神气质，她们从哪儿得到的？当我看到小小的简在慈善学校的麻烦时，我真的是太生气了，只好出去散步。我明白她的感受，认识了李佩特太太，我就等于认识了布罗克霍斯特先生。

不要生气，叔叔，我不是矫情地说约翰·格里尔之家和罗沃德兹学校一样，我们够吃、够穿，水也够洗用，地下室里还有炉子。但有一点是完全相像的：生活单调、一成不变。没什么能让人兴奋的事，除了星期天有冰淇淋，即使这个也只是成规而已。十八年我都在那里，只经历了一回惊险——木棚被烧掉了。那天，我们不得不深更半夜起床，穿上衣服准备好，担心房子会被烧掉。不过没有，我们又上床睡觉了。

每个人都喜欢有点惊喜。这是很自然的。但是我从来没有过，直到李佩特太太把我叫去办公室，告诉我约翰·史密斯先生要送我上大学。她慢吞吞地告诉我这个消息，所以我只是惊呆了。

你知道吗，叔叔，我认为每个人最需要的素质就是有想象力，它能让人设身处地为他人着想，让人们变得和气、有同情心、能善解人意。这些都应该从小培养，然而只要我们冒出一点想象力的火花，约翰·格里尔之家就立刻将其踩灭。他们注重责任感，但我不认为孩子应该了解这个词，这个词让人讨厌，孩子们做所有的事都应该从爱出发。

等您看我当了孤儿院的头儿，您就明白了。这是我晚上睡觉前最爱玩的游戏。我事无巨细都有计划，吃饭、穿衣、学习、娱乐和处罚——即便像我这样最优秀的孤儿，也会有些不好的。

不过，无论如何，他们会快乐的。我认为每个人，不管他长大以后会有多少麻烦，都应该有个幸福的童年值得回望。要是我自己有孩子的话，不管我自己多么不开心，我都要让他们无忧无虑地长大。

（礼拜堂的钟声又响了——下次我再写完这封信吧。）

今天下午从试验室回来，发现有只松鼠坐在茶几上吃杏仁。我们很欢迎它们来访，天气暖和了，窗户都开着——



星期四

昨天是星期五，今天没有课，所以您大概以为我会抱着用奖学金买的那套史蒂文森度过一个祥和、安静的读书之夜？但如果是这样，您真是从没有读过女校。亲爱的叔叔，六个女孩子跑过来做软糖，其中一个把糖滴在了最好的地毯上——那时糖还是液体——正好是中央的位置。我们没有办法把它洗干净了。

我后来再没提过任何一门课程了，但是，实际上我们每天都要上课。从学习中逃开，和您聊聊生活算是一种放松。可惜我们的谈话都是单方面的，这是您自己的错。您任何时候给我写信我都是欢迎的。

这封信我写写停停地有三天了，我现在担心您都烦死啦。

再见，耐心的绅士先生。

茱迪

亲爱的长腿叔叔：

叔叔，你肯定猜不出来，我有个好消息。

迈克布莱德一家邀请我这个夏天去他们阿迪朗达克的营地玩！他们是一家湖边俱乐部的成员，那个俱乐部位于树林间的湖边。俱乐部成员的小木屋散布在树林间，他们在湖心划船，或者徒步走过长长的小路去其他营地玩。俱乐部每个星期都有一次舞会——杰米有个大学同学会去那里度过一段夏日时光，所以，我们有足够的男舞伴啦。

迈克布莱德夫人邀请了我，这是不是很美好？看样子我在她那里过圣诞时，她还是挺喜欢我的。

请原谅我吧，这不能算是一封信，太短了，只是为了告诉您我这个夏天的去向。

您的，有一颗知足的心的

茱迪

6月2日





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

您的秘书刚刚给我写信，说史密斯先生希望我不要接受迈克布莱德夫人的邀请，而是像去年夏天一样去罗克维罗。

为什么，为什么，为什么呢，叔叔？

您不知道，迈克布莱德夫人是真的想让我去，她很真诚。在那幢屋子里，我一点点也算不上麻烦，我能当个助手呢。他们家没有太多仆人，萨莉和我能做很多有用的事。对我而言，这也是个学习持家的好机会。本来每个女人都应该学习的。但是我只会做一些孤儿院里的杂务。

夏令营并没有多少我这年纪的姑娘，迈克布莱德夫人想让我去和萨莉做伴。我们计划一起读好多好多的书，我们要读能为明年的英语和社会学打基础的所有书。教授说要是我们这个夏天读完这些书，会有很大帮助；要是我们能一起读书，一起讨论，会更容易记住的。

单是和萨莉的妈妈住在一个屋檐下，就是种教育。她是这世界上最好玩、最好客、最友善、最可爱的人，她什么都懂。想想呢，我和李佩特太太一起度过了那么多个夏天，对完全不一样的人是多么的心存感激。您不用担心拥挤，他们的房子是橡胶做的，人多的时候，只要在林间撑开帐篷，把男孩子赶过去就行了。夏天在户外活动大有好处，于身心健康有益。杰米·迈克布莱德要教我骑马、划船、射击，还有——噢，很多很多我应该会的东西。这段时间我会很快乐的，无忧无虑，这是我之前从没有过的经历，我以为每个女孩一生都该有一回！当然了，我会听您的话，但是叔叔，请让我去吧。我从来没有如此渴望呢。

这不是杰瑞莎·艾伯特——未来的伟大作家——在给您写信，这是茱迪在给您写信，她只是一个女孩子。

6月5日





约翰·史密斯先生：

先生，您7日的便条已收悉。按照您的秘书转达的指示，我将于周五启程前往罗克维罗农场度假。

我希望仍是您的

杰瑞莎·艾伯特（小姐）

6月9日





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

距上次给您写信已有近两个月了，是我不好，我知道。但这个夏天我不是很爱您——您知道我很直率！

您不知道让我放弃同迈克布莱德一家野营的机会我有多失望。当然我知道您是我的监护人，所有的事情我都应该尊重您的意见，不过我找不出理由。很清楚，这本来是可以发生在我身上的最好的事情。如果我是叔叔您，您是茱迪的话，我就会说：“祝福你，我的孩子，去吧，好好玩，认识很多很多新朋友，学习很多很多新事物，到户外走一走，变得强壮一些，经过了一年的艰苦学习，好好休息一下吧。”

但根本不是这样！您的秘书草草而就一行字，命令我去罗克维罗！

是您毫无人情味的命令伤害了我的感情。哪怕您有一点点像我为您着想一样为我着想，您都会偶尔给我送张便条——您亲手写的，而不是那些没人情味儿的打字机打出来的秘书便条。假如有些许迹象证明您关心我，我可以做任何事情来讨您的欢喜。

我知道，我应该写礼貌的长信、一些很详尽的信，而不奢求您的答复，您遵守了您的承诺——送我上大学——我想您会觉得我没有遵守我的诺言！

但是，叔叔，这个条件太难了。真的。我很孤独。您是我唯一必须在乎的人，却藏在阴影之下。您只是我想象中虚构的一个男人——可能真实的您和我想象的您没有丝毫相同之处。但是，您曾那样做过，当我在医务室生病的时候，您写了一张短条子给我，而现在，每当我觉得自己被完全遗忘的时候，就会再把卡片拿出来读上一遍。

我想我具体的想法并没有说清楚，其实是这样的：

虽然我的感情受到了伤害。被专制、绝断、无理、全能、看不见的天意选中并且支配，这是一件非常丢脸的事。不过，一个像您一样善良、慷慨、思虑周到地对待我的男人，我猜想您是有权力做专制、绝断、无理、全能、看不见的天意，只要您愿意这么选择。因此，我可以谅解您，再一次快乐起来。不过，当我收到萨莉那些描述他们在营地的快乐时光的来信时，仍然很难过。

不管怎么样——我们不提这个了，重新开始吧。

这个夏天，我不停地写啊写啊，我已经完成了四个短篇故事，并且寄往四家不同的杂志社。这样您就知道我是努力地尝试当作家了。我在阳台的角落有一个固定的工作间，杰维少爷曾经把这里当雨天玩耍的地方。角落有些冷，透风，开了两扇天窗，窗口有棵枫树，树上有个洞，里面住了一窝红松鼠。

过几天我会写一封礼貌的信告诉您农场的消息。

我们需要雨水。

您永远的

茱迪

8月3日

于罗克维罗





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

先生，我坐在农场池塘边的柳树的第二个分杈上给您写信。脚底蛙鸣不断，头顶上蝉在歌唱。树干上两只虫子上上下下地来回飞奔。我在这里待了有一个小时了，这个树杈很舒服，特别是还垫了两个沙发垫。我带上来一支钢笔和一叠便笺，希望能写出个不朽的短篇来。然而我和我的女主人公度过了一段极为糟糕的时光——我没法依照我的构思来指挥她的行为，现在我放弃了她，决定给您写信。（这也并不轻松，我也没法按照我的构思来指挥您的行为。）

如果您住在那个可怕的纽约，我希望我可以把这儿微风习习、阳光灿烂的美好景色送给您。落了一星期的雨，乡下美得像天堂。

讲到天堂，您还记得凯罗格先生吗？我去年夏天告诉过您的——街角的那座白色小教堂的牧师。可怜的老人家去世了——去年的冬天死于肺炎。我听过他的六场布道，对他的神学理论非常熟悉。他坚信结束等同于开始。我觉得，像他这样能四十七年始终坚守自己的信念，连一丝念头都没改变过的人，可以当作奇人陈列在橱柜里。我真希望他现在怀抱竖琴，头顶金冠——这些东西他肯定都能找得到！接替他的是个傲慢的年轻人，教徒们人心惶惶，特别是执事卡明斯那一派。看上去教堂将会有一场可怕的分裂，这儿的人不愿意进行宗教改革。

下雨的这个星期，我在阳台上尽情地读书——大部分时间读史蒂文森的书。他自己这个人比他书里的任何角色都有意思，我敢说他要是把自己写进小说，一定很不错。他拿父亲留下来的一万美元买了一艘游艇畅游南洋，您不认为这是个很棒的主意吗？他实现了他冒险的愿望。要是我爸爸留给我一万美元，我也这么做，去瓦利马的想法令我着迷呢。我想到热带地区去看一看，我想看看世界，有一天我会去的——我会的，真的，叔叔，等我成了一个大作家，或者艺术家，或者女演员，或者剧作家——不管我最终成了什么了不起的人物吧，我都强烈渴望去流浪，一看见地图我就想戴上帽子拿上伞立即出发。“在我的有生之年，一定要看看南洋的寺庙和棕榈树。”

8月10日





从这封信里很难看到有什么新鲜事的！茱迪最近变得如此哲学，喜欢谈论世界大事，而不是日常生活的琐碎小事。不过，倘若您一定要知道一点新鲜事儿，这就是了：

上个星期二，我们的九头小猪涉过小溪跑掉了，只回来了八头。我们不想冤枉谁，但我们还是觉得道顿寡妇那里多了头小猪。



维沃先生把他的谷仓以及两个筒仓漆成了明亮的南瓜黄——非常难看，但他说这颜色耐脏。

这个星期布鲁尔夫妇来了客人——布鲁尔太太的姐姐和两个侄子，从俄亥俄州来了。

一只罗得岛红鸡下了十五个蛋，只孵出来三只小鸡。不知道问题出在哪里。我一直觉得这鸡种不太好，我更喜欢奥尔平顿鸡。



邦尼里格十字街角邮局的新职员把库存的牙买加姜汁喝到一滴不剩——价值七美元——而后才被发现。

老艾拉·哈彻得了风湿，再也不能工作了，他能赚很多钱的时候从来没有存过钱，所以他现在只好靠政府救济生活。

下个星期六晚上，学校的教学楼有一场冰淇淋晚会，请带着您的家人一起来吧。

我在邮局用二十五美分买了一顶新帽子。这是我最近的肖像，我正要去耙干草。



天已经黑得看不见了。反正所有的消息也都说完了。

晚安

茱迪

星期四黄昏，坐在门前的台阶上





早上好！有消息来啦！您觉得会是什么事？您永远不会、不会、不会猜到是谁要来罗克维罗。彭德莱顿先生给森普尔太太写了一封信，说他驾车经过伯克郡，现在他累了，想到一个小小的、安静的农场休息——要是某天夜晚他爬到她的门前，森普尔太太会不会为他准备好房间呢？他也许会待一个星期左右，或者两个星期，也可能三个星期，这得等他来了之后视情况而定。

我们都非常兴奋！整座房子被打扫得干干净净，所有的窗帘都洗了。今天上午我赶车去了十字街角，因为进门的地方需要新油布，大厅和后楼梯需要两罐棕色的地板漆。道顿太太明天要来擦窗户（在这种紧要关头，我们放弃了对小猪事件的疑心）。您可能会想，从我们的行为来看，这房子以前不太干净，是不是？但我敢向您保证，它太干净了！森普尔太太学问不大，但是是一个好管家！

他是不是很像个真正的男人，叔叔？他没有给我们一点点提示说他哪天来，今天还是要过两个星期，我们只能屏住呼吸等，直到他来——要是他不快点来，我们可能得再大扫除一次。

阿马塞在楼下等着我呢，有一辆四轮马车，还有格罗弗。我自己赶车——不过，您若是见过老格罗弗，就不会担心我的安全了。

老格罗弗安全得很



我的手按在心口——再见。

茱迪

星期五

及：这是不是个很好的结尾？我从史蒂文森的信里学来的。





再一次道早安！昨天我没能赶在邮递员来之前把信封起来，今天就再加一点内容吧。邮递员每天十二点来，对农民们来说农村邮件的传递就像福音一样！我们的邮递员不仅仅送信，还帮我们在镇子上办事，每一件差事五美分。昨天他帮我带了一些鞋带，还有一瓶面霜（买新帽子以前，我鼻子上的皮肤都被太阳晒脱皮了），另外他还带了一条蓝色的温莎领带、一瓶黑色的鞋油。手续费十美分，这是很少有的折扣，因为我买的东西多。

他还会告诉我们外面的世界里发生的事情。沿路有几家人订了日报，他在路上看看报纸，然后跟那些没有订报的人说说。要是美国和日本之间爆发了战争，或者总统被暗杀，或者洛克菲勒先生留给约翰·格里尔之家一百万美元，您不需要写信告诉我，我会听说的。

到现在还不见杰维少爷的影踪。不过您真该看看我们的房子多么干净，每回进屋之前，我们都使劲地把鞋子擦干净。

我希望他快一点来，我盼着有人能说说话呢。说实话吧，森普尔太太有点无趣。她说起话来滔滔不绝，但一点想法也没有。这里的人们非常有意思，他们的天地只是这山顶，与外面的世界没什么联系，您能明白我的意思吧，就跟约翰·格里尔之家一样。那个时候，我们的想法也都被四面的铁栅栏挡住了，当时我并不放在心上，因为我还小，而且也忙得要死。等我铺好床，把娃娃们的脸洗好去学校上课，放学回去再洗洗他们的脸，补补袜子以及弗雷德·帕金斯的裤子（他每天都把裤子撕坏）。一旦有空，就得准备自己的功课——上床的时候根本就不会注意到自己缺乏社会交流。但两年的大学生活下来，我真的很想和人交往，也真的很高兴有人能来和我聊天。

我想我该停笔了，叔叔，目前为止没事了，下次我试着写长一点。

您永远的

茱迪

星期六

及：今年莴苣长得不好，前些日子太旱了。





啊，亲爱的叔叔，杰维少爷终于来了。我们相处得很开心！至少我这么觉得，我想他也一样吧——他在这里已经有十天了，还没有任何要走的迹象。森普尔太太把这个男人惯坏了，要是他小时候她就这么惯着他，我真弄不明白他为什么会出落得这么优秀了。

他和我在边廊的一张小桌子上吃饭，有的时候是在树底下，要是下雨或者天气太冷的话，就在最好的客厅里吃饭。他随意挑选他吃饭的地方，凯莉跟在他后面收拾桌子。如果很麻烦的话，或者需要她把盘子端得很远，她就会在糖罐底下发现一美元。

他是个很好的伴儿，尽管第一次见面的时候很难让人相信。一眼看上去，他就是个彭德莱顿家的人，然而实际上他一点也不像。他纯朴自然，相当讨人喜欢——这样形容一个男人是不是很可笑？不过这是真的。他和这一带的农民关系都特别好，碰到他们的时候，他就以真诚的姿态和他们相处，立刻就能打消他们的疑虑。一开始的时候，他们不相信他，看不惯他的穿着。我得说，他的衣服真让人吃惊。他穿灯笼裤、打褶夹克衫、白色法兰绒上衣，还有就是骑马装和肥大的裤子。不管什么时候，只要他穿着新衣服下楼来，森普尔太太总是会眉飞色舞充满骄傲地围着他打转，从每个角度欣赏他，提醒他坐下来时小心一点，生怕他碰到一点点的灰尘。他觉得很烦恼，他总是会对她说：

“走开吧，丽莎，去做你自己的事情。我已经长大了，你不能再管着我了。”

想起来真是太可笑了。这个长腿的大男人（他的腿几乎跟您的一样长，叔叔）曾经坐在森普尔太太的膝上，让她给他洗脸。要是您看到她的膝盖就太有趣了，如今的她一条腿有两个膝盖那么粗，还长了三个下巴。不过他说她以前很瘦，结实灵活，跑得比他还快。



我们在一起有很多很多好玩的新鲜事。我们游历了几英里范围的乡间，我学会了用羽毛做苍蝇钩钓鱼，还学会了用来复枪、左轮手枪射击，以及骑马——老格罗弗的生命力惊人。我们连着三天用燕麦喂它，结果它看到小牛的时候惊得连连倒退，差点就带着我跑掉了。

8月25日





星期一下午我们爬了斯盖山，就在附近，不是很高，也许——山顶上没有雪——但是爬到顶的时候还是会喘不上气来。低处的斜坡覆盖着树林，山顶上却是石头一堆，还有一片开阔的沼泽地。我们等到太阳落山的时候点火做饭。杰维少爷烧饭，他说他比我强——是的，他的确比我强，因为他早已经习惯野营生活了。而后我们借着月光下山，走进了一片漆黑的树林，只有他口袋里的手电筒的一点光可以借亮。真好玩呀！他一路笑呀开玩笑呀，说了一些很有趣的事，我读过的书他全都读过，除此以外，他还知道许多许多别的事。他懂得这么多东西，真让人惊讶。

今天上午我们步行了很远很远，结果碰到暴雨，到家之前衣服湿透了——但我们的精力没有被浇灭。您真该看看我们滴着水进厨房时森普尔太太的表情。

“哦，杰维少爷，茱迪小姐！你们被淋得湿透了。我的天！亲爱的！怎么办？好好的新衣服全给毁掉了。”

她真的很滑稽，感觉我们只有十岁大，而她是被惹恼的妈妈。有一会儿，我还真的担心喝茶时她不给我们果酱吃了呢。

星期三





老早老早就开始写这封信了，但是我竟然找不到一秒钟的空闲时间来结尾。

史蒂文森的看法不是很好吗？——

世界充满了众多的事情，

我确信我们应该像国王一样快乐。

真的是这样的，您知道的，如果不奢求的话，只想得到那些属于自己的，这个世界就会充满了欢乐。奥秘就是顺应。特别是乡间，有许多许多有趣的东西，我可以走过别人的土地，欣赏别家的风景，在别人的溪流中涉水而过，就好像一切都是自己的一样享受它们——而且还不用交税！




现在已经是星期天的晚上了，大概是十一点，我本该美梦正酣，不过因为晚餐的时候喝了黑咖啡，所以睡不着了！

今天早上，森普尔太太坚决地对彭德莱顿先生说：“我们必须十点一刻出发，十一点钟就可以到教堂了。”

“非常好，丽莎，”杰维少爷说，“你备好马车，要是到时候我还没穿好衣服，你就先去吧。”

“我们等你。”她回答说。

“你愿意等的话就等，”他说，“不过也别让马站得太久。”

等到她穿衣服的时候，他让凯莉把午饭打包，叫我穿上便服，我们从后门的小路溜走钓鱼去了。

他把家务事的安排全给打乱了，因为罗克维罗星期天吃饭的时间是两点，但他定在了七点——他总是高兴什么时候吃就什么时候吃，好像在餐馆似的——这样凯莉和阿马塞就不能赶车出门了。他说这样正好，没人看着让他们赶车出去也不合适，他正好还需要马教我怎么驾车呢。您有没有听过这么好笑的事？

可怜的森普尔太太相信，星期天去钓鱼的人将来会下地狱！她非常烦恼，后悔在他幼小无助的时候没能把他管教好。再说，她本来是打算带他到教堂去出一出风头的。

不管怎么样，我们去钓鱼了（他钓了四条小鱼），在火上烤熟了当午饭。鱼老是从我们穿着的木棍上掉进火堆里，所以吃起来有灰味，不过我们还是吃下去了。四点钟我们回家，五点钟又去驾车，七点钟吃饭，十点钟上床睡觉——现在呢，给您写信。

我有点困了。




晚安

附一幅我的画，画的是我钓的“鱼”。





喂，长腿船长：

且慢！把船停下！哟，嗬，嗬，来瓶朗姆酒。猜猜我在看的是什么书？过去这两天我们谈的都是航海和海盗。《金银岛》很有意思，您有没有读过？您小的时候有这本书了吗？史蒂文森这套书版权只卖了三十英镑——我没法相信这是付给伟大作家的稿酬。我想我还是教书好了。

请原谅我一再提到史蒂文森，现在我的心里全是他。罗克维罗图书馆只有他的书。

我这封信写了两个星期，我觉得太久啦。叔叔，不要怪我没写什么详细的内容，我真的希望您也在这里，这么快乐的时光我们一起度过。我喜欢我的朋友们彼此相识。我想问问彭德莱顿先生在纽约是不是认识您——我想他是认识您的，你们本来就在同一个社会阶层里，你们都对改革之类的事情感兴趣——不过我没法问，我连您的真名都不知道呢。

不知道您的真名，这可真好笑。李佩特太太警告我说您这人很古怪。我是应该这样想！

挚爱您的

茱迪

及：又看了一遍这信，我发现信里不光提了史蒂文森，也简略地提到了杰维少爷。

星期六





亲爱的叔叔：

他走了，我们大家都很想念他！当你习惯了某个人、某个地方，或者是某种生活方式的时候，上天又把这一切一下子抢走，剩下的就会是可怕的空虚在撕咬着你的情感。我觉得森普尔太太的谈话更没意思了。

还有两个星期学校就要开学了，我很高兴又要开始上课了，尽管这个夏天我已经学了很多——我写了六个短故事，还有七首诗。那些寄给杂志的文章都被注上最有礼貌的评语退了回来，但我不介意，这是种很好的锻炼。杰维少爷看过这些文章——信是他拿进屋来的，我没法不让他知道，他说我的作品很糟糕，看不出我到底想说些什么。（杰维少爷说话直来直去的。）不过最后有一篇写大学生活的，他说不坏。他用打字机把它打出来了，我寄给了一家杂志社。已经两个星期过去了，大概他们也该考虑完了吧。

您真该看看这会儿的天色，大地笼罩着非常非常奇怪的橘黄色光芒。要下暴雨了。




刚刚开始下雨了，雨点有二十五美分的硬币那么大，敲得百叶窗砰砰作响。我只好跑去关窗户，凯莉飞一样地蹿去了阳台，抱着一摞牛奶桶放到屋子漏水的地方。我重新拿起笔写信，忽然想起我把垫子、毯子、帽子还有马修·阿诺德的诗集放在花园的树底下了，我冲出去拿它们，但是它们已经全湿透了，诗集封面的红色渗进了书里头，《多佛海岸》(13)快被粉红色的波浪淹没了。

暴雨在乡下是很要命的，你得记得有那么多东西在门外，雨水会毁了它们的。

9月10日





叔叔！叔叔！您猜怎么了？邮递员刚送来了两封信！

第一封——我的小说被采用了。五十美元。

乌拉！我是个作家了。

第二封——从学校秘书处来的，我能拿到两年的奖学金了，包括膳食费和学费。这是一个女校友设立的，“用以奖励英文成绩优秀，其他学科也能达到良好水平的学生”。我得到了！我离校之前申请的，但是从来没想过真的能拿到。因为大一的时候我的拉丁文和数学很糟糕，看来这个缺陷我已经弥补啦。我真的很高兴，叔叔，因为现在我对您来说不是那么大的负担了。每个月给我零花钱就足够了，而且可能我会用写作、家教，或者其他办法赚到零花钱的。

我发疯地想回去上学呢。

您永远的

杰瑞莎·艾伯特

星期四

《大二学生赢了》的作者，刊载此文的杂志所有报摊上有售，售价十美分。





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

我已经回学校了，升了一年级，今年我们的书房比以前的好多了——正对着南面，有两扇大窗户——哦！布置得这么好。茱莉娅带着花不完的零用钱早来了两天，忙着布置房间。

我们有了新墙纸、东方地毯、桃花心木椅子——不是那种漆成桃花心木的椅子。那样的椅子去年我们就有了，为此还着实很开心过。不过这次是真货，非常豪华。不过，我对它没有安全感，它令我神经质，老担心墨水会滴上去。

还有，叔叔，我发现您的信在等着我——请原谅——我的意思是您秘书的信。

您可以好心地转告我一个可理解的理由，告诉我为什么不应该接受那笔奖学金吗？我的确一点儿也不明白您反对的原因。不过，不管怎么样啦，反对也没用了，因为我已经接受了——而且不会改变的！听起来很没礼貌，但我本来不想这样的。

我猜想，您觉得是您开始供我学习的，所以您想独立地完成这项工作，一个人把我供到最后拿到学位。

但是，请您从我的角度来看这件事。我所接受的教育归功于您，这和由您全部承担是一样的，但我就不必背负那么巨大的债务了。我当然知道的，您没打算让我还钱，不过，无论如何，只要有可能，我还是想这么做，而且能拿到奖学金就好办多了。本来我得用一生的时间来还债，但现在我只需要一半时间就可以了。

我希望您可以明白我的处境，不要再反对了。我还是会十分感激地接受您的零用钱。因为和茱莉娅，还有她的家具住在一起是需要零用钱的。我真希望她朴素一点，或者她干脆不是我室友。

这不是一封长信，我本来想写很多的——不过我得给四条窗帘缝边，还有三个门帘（我很高兴您看不见针脚有多么长）。另外，还要用牙粉给铜桌子上光（非常艰难的工作），用指甲刀绞掉照片框的金属丝，打开四箱子书，收拾两行李箱的衣服。（杰瑞莎·艾伯特能有两箱子衣服，难以置信，但这是真的！）在此期间，还要迎接五十个亲爱的朋友返校！

开学这天是高兴的一天！

晚安，亲爱的叔叔，不要因为您保护的小鸡想独立就不开心。她会长成一只精力充沛的小母鸡——大声地咯咯叫，长着漂亮的羽毛（而这一切都归功于您）。

挚爱您的

茱迪

9月26日





亲爱的叔叔：

您仍然为了奖学金喋喋不休？我从来没见过像您这么倔、死板、不讲理、顽固到不能站在别人立场上思考的男人。

您希望我不要接受陌生人的好处。

陌生人！——您又是谁？发发慈悲吧！

这世界上还有什么人比您让我了解得更少呢？在街上遇见您我都不可能认出您来。现在，您看看，如果您神志清楚、通情达理，像个父亲那样给小茱迪写过表达关切的信，偶尔过来看看她，拍拍她的脑袋告诉她您很高兴她是这么好的一个姑娘——那么，也许在您年纪这么大的时候，她就不会不尊重您了，她会尊重您每一个最微小的愿望，当一个孝顺的女儿。

真正的陌生人！史密斯先生，您自己才是呢。

另外，这也不是什么好处，这是奖励——这是我努力学习得到的。如果没有出色的英文成绩，委员会不会给奖学金，他们有好几年没发过了。再说——不过，和男人争辩有用吗？史密斯先生，你们男人没有逻辑可言。让男人讲道理只有两个办法：一个是耐心地哄，另一个就是惹他们生厌。我不想为了自己的心愿去哄男人，那么，我就让您生厌吧。

我拒绝，先生，我拒绝放弃奖学金，如果您仍然小题大做，我也不要您每个月的零用钱了，我可以给那些笨蛋般的大一学生当家教，一直到累趴下。

这是我的最后通牒！

听着——我有个进一步的想法。既然您这么担心我拿到奖学金会剥夺其他学生的教育机会，我知道有个办法可以解决的。您可以把原本打算花在我身上的钱用于支持约翰·格里尔之家另一个女孩受教育，这是不是个好主意？但是，叔叔，您可以去支持别的女孩受教育，但请不要更喜欢她，好不好？

我相信您的秘书不会因为我漠视他来信的建议而受到伤害，不过，如果他要这样我也没办法。他就像个被惯坏的孩子，叔叔，在此之前，我一直温顺地忍让他的突发奇想，但这一回我很坚定。

您的，心意已决、永不改变、未来会补偿您的

杰瑞莎·艾伯特

亲爱的长腿叔叔：

我今天进城去买了一盒鞋油、几个衣领、一块上衣料子、一瓶紫罗兰护肤霜、一块橄榄皂——这些都非常必要，没有它们，我的日子就快乐不起来。不过我准备付车票钱的时候，突然发现钱包丢在另一件衣服的口袋里了。我只好下车，然后坐下一班车，这样体育课就迟到了。

没记性却有两件外套实在太讨厌了！

茱莉娅邀请我去她家过圣诞节。这个消息刺激到您了吗，史密斯先生？约翰·格里尔之家那个爱幻想的杰瑞莎·艾伯特，居然与富人们同座。我也不知道为什么茱莉娅会邀请我——她最近似乎很喜欢和我黏在一起。说句实话，我更想去萨莉家，但因为是茱莉娅先邀请了我，所以要是会去哪里的话，第一个得是纽约而不是伍斯特。将要面对一群彭德莱顿让我现在就满怀敬畏，还得去添置新衣服。所以，亲爱的叔叔，如果您写信说您希望我乖乖地待在学校，我会像以往一样顺您的心的。

我现在迷上了《赫胥黎生平与书信》，感觉很好，一有空就拿起来读一段，很轻松。您知道什么是始祖鸟吗？是一种鸟，还是恐龙？我自己也不太肯定呢，是一种绝种的动物吧，好像是长了牙齿的鸟，或者是长了翅膀的蜥蜴。不是，都不对，我刚刚查过书，它是一种中生代的哺乳动物。

这是仅存的一幅始祖鸟的画像



今年我选修了经济学——非常具有启发性的学科。学完之后，我就去选修慈善事业与革新。然后，理事先生，我就知道如何管理孤儿院了。您不觉得，要是我有选举权的话，我会是一个值得赞赏的选民吗？上个星期我满二十一岁了。这个国家真是非常浪费，不要我这样一个诚实、有教养、尽责任而且聪明的选民！

您永远的

茱迪

亲爱的长腿叔叔：

谢谢您同意我去茱莉娅家。我把您的沉默视为同意。

现在我们的社交活动接连不断！上个星期是学校创始人舞会，今年是头一次任何人都能参加，以前这个舞会只让高年级学生参加。

我邀请了杰米·迈克布莱德，萨莉则邀请了杰米在普林斯顿大学的室友，去年夏天的野营他也去了，是一个很好的红头发男人。茱莉娅从纽约请了个男人来，不是很有意思的那种人，不过社交上无可挑剔。他和德拉马特·奇彻斯特家有关系。也许您是知道的？这个名字对我没有一点意义。

不管怎样，星期五的下午，我们的客人准时去了高年级学姐的走廊喝茶，然后又去酒店吃晚餐。酒店挤得满满的，以至于他们说要在台球桌上排成一排睡觉。杰米·迈克布莱德说下回来这个学校参加社交活动的话，他得带一个阿迪朗达克帐篷，可以在校园里扎营。

七点半的时候，他们回来参加了主席的招待舞会。我们的舞会很早就开始了！我们事先都把客人的名牌做好了，每跳完一支舞，他们就依照姓名首字母的顺序站在名牌底下，方便下一轮舞伴找到他们。比如杰米·迈克布莱德，就得耐心地在M的位置等着，等有人邀请他（至少，他本应该耐心等着的，而事实上，他总是到处乱跑，老和R、S字母开头的人弄混）。我发现他真是个难侍候的客人，因为我只和他跳了三支舞，他就生闷气了。他说他不好意思和陌生女孩子跳舞！

第二天上午，我们去听了一场非常开心的俱乐部音乐会——您知道是谁为这场音乐会写了首滑稽的歌吗？是的，就是我。我告诉您吧，叔叔，您的小孤儿现在挺有名的了！

无论如何，这两天相当尽兴。我想男客们也这么觉得吧，有些人刚开始面对上千个女孩子时很不安，但很快也就适应了。普林斯顿大学的两个男生这段日子过得真是开心——至少他们有礼貌地这么说，并且邀请我们明年春天到他们那里去参加舞会，我们同意了。就是这样了，亲爱的叔叔，不要反对。

茱莉娅、萨莉，还有我都有了新衣服。您想不想听听？茱莉娅的那件是流水一样的缎子衣服，金黄色的绣花，还戴了一朵紫色的兰花。这件来自巴黎的衣服价值一百万美元，梦一般美妙。

萨莉是一件波斯绣镶边的淡蓝色衣服，配她的红头发很漂亮。她这件没花一百万美元，但是和茱莉娅的一样美。

我的那件是淡粉色的中国绉绸，镶着米色的花边、玫瑰色缎带，戴着杰米送给我的绯红玫瑰花（萨莉告诉他买这种颜色的）。我们全穿着缎子软鞋、丝袜，配着纱围巾。

您肯定对这样女性化的描述印象很深刻吧！

我忍不住会想，叔叔，男人的生活肯定一点色彩也没有，他们对尼龙绸、威尼斯针绣花边、手工刺绣、爱尔兰钩针编织的概念一片空白。而女人呢，不管她的兴趣是孩子、微生物、丈夫、诗歌、仆人，还是平行四边形、花园、柏拉图、桥牌——最根本的是她永远会对衣服感兴趣。

这是天性，世人所共有的天性。（这不是原创，我从莎士比亚戏剧里看到的。）

不管怎么样，继续往下说，您想不想听我告诉您我最近发现的秘密？您要发誓不会觉得我很虚荣啊。那么，就听听吧：

我长得很漂亮。

我真的很漂亮。要是面对屋里的三面镜子我还是不知道的话，那我就是个白痴了。

一个朋友

及：小说里您见过这种恶作剧匿名信的。





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

我只有很短的时间，因为有两堂课我必须要上，然后收拾一个大箱子和一个手提箱，赶四点钟的火车，但我不能一个字也不写就走，我得让您知道我有多么喜欢您送的圣诞礼物。

我喜欢皮衣、项链、利伯蒂围巾、手套、手绢、书，还有钱包——但我最爱的还是您！不过叔叔，您没有义务这么宠我。我只是个普普通通的人，一个女孩子而已。您用世间繁华来分散我的注意力，我怎么能勤奋地专注于自己的学业呢？

我现在猜到之前约翰·格里尔之家的圣诞树和星期天的冰淇淋，究竟是哪一位理事送的了。他没留名字，不过通过他的行为，我知道他是谁了！因为您所做的一切好事，您应该拥有幸福。

再见，并祝您圣诞节非常非常开心。

您永远的

茱迪

12月20日

及：我也送您一枚小纪念币。您要是认识她的话，会不会喜欢她呢？





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

我本来是打算在城里的时候就给您写信的，叔叔，然而纽约是个引人入胜的地方。

我过了一段好玩又很有启发的时光。但我还是庆幸我不是那家庭的成员！我真的宁可在约翰·格里尔之家长大。无论我的成长有多么大的缺陷，至少不算虚伪。现在我明白了人们说“钱烧晕了”是什么意思了。在那房子里，物质的氛围压倒了一切，直到坐上回来的直达列车，我都没有深呼吸的机会。所有的家具都是精雕细琢过的，装了垫子，非常豪华；碰到的人都衣着光鲜，声音压得低低的，受过良好的教育。然而，叔叔，从我到达一直到我离开，我就没听过一句真心话，这是真的。我不认为会有什么新观念能进入那扇大门。

彭德莱顿太太除了珠宝、裁缝、社交以外什么都不想，她和迈克布莱德太太完全是两种类型的妈妈！如果我也结婚了，有一个家庭，我就要尽力让所有的人和迈克布莱德家的人一样快乐。我不会让我的孩子变成彭德莱顿家人那样的，在这个世界上只有钱可言。批评邀请我的人，也许很不礼貌吧，要是的话，那就请您原谅我。这是个秘密，你我之间的秘密。

我只见过杰维少爷一次。有一天喝茶的时候他来拜访，但我根本没有机会和他单独讲话，在我们共同度过了那么美好的一个夏天之后，这有点让人失望。我并不认为他真的在乎他的亲戚，我也很肯定他们同样并不在乎他。茱莉娅的妈妈说他不正常，是个社会主义者。感谢上帝呢，他没留长头发，也没系红领带。她没法想象他那些古怪的念头都是从哪里来的，这个家庭几代人都信英国国教，而他却把自己的钱全都扔在了各种各样的疯狂改革之中，而没有明智地花在游艇、汽车、马球上。不过，他也会花钱买糖！圣诞节，他送给我和茱莉娅一人一盒糖。

您知道吗，我想我可能也会是一个社会主义者，您不会介意吧？叔叔，这和无政府主义者不一样，他们不主张个人的过分膨胀。可能我就是这样的人，属于无产阶级。我还没想好是哪一种社会主义者呢，星期天的时候我考虑一下这个问题，下次再宣布我的主张。

我看到很多很多的戏院、酒店、漂亮房屋。我的脑子里塞满了乱七八糟的玛瑙、镀金、嵌花地板和棕榈树，我都有些窒息了。不过，我很高兴回到学校、回到书本中——我相信我真的是个学生，学校的气氛比纽约更能鼓舞我。校园生活让我感觉满足，书本、学习、规律的班级生活使精神能够保持活力。感觉疲劳的时候，就去体育馆或者室外活动活动，总会碰见一些性情相投的朋友和你有同样的想法。有时候，我们一个晚上什么也不干，只是聊天、聊天、聊天，到了上床睡觉的时间精神还是很高昂，就像我们永远地解决了几件压迫全人类的世界大事似的。尽管都是些废话，还穿插一些傻乎乎的小玩笑，但我们心满意足，我们很欣赏自己妙语连珠！

算起来，这还不是最快乐的事！从很多很多琐碎的小事中都能找到很大很大的快乐——我发现了快乐的真谛，叔叔，那就是活在当下。永远不要活在对过去的悔恨中，也不要总在盼望未来，而是努力从现有的这一刻中得到更多快乐。这就像耕田一样，可以广耕，也可以精耕。好吧，从此以后，我会精细地生活，享受每一秒钟，享受的时候我知道这是种享受。大部分人并不是在生活，而是在赛跑。他们想到达一些远离地平线的目标。在路上，他们气喘吁吁、呼吸困难，失去了欣赏路上美好、宁静乡村的机会。然后，等他们老了累了，他们懂的第一件事就是目标达不达到已经不重要了。而我呢，则决定在路边坐下来，堆积起所有微小的快乐，即便我永远不能成为一个伟大作家。您之前认不认识像茱迪一样的女哲学家呢？

您永远的

茱迪

1月11日

及：今天晚上雨下得很大，两只小狗崽还有一只小猫刚刚爬到窗台上来了。





亲爱的同志：

万岁！我现在是个费边主义者了。

这是一种愿意耐心等待的社会主义者，我们不会盼望明天一早就发生一场社会革命——那可太让人恐慌了。我们希望它能缓慢地发生在遥远的未来，那时候我们应该已经做好了准备，可以承受这样的震荡了。

同时，我们必须要做好准备，进行工业、教育、孤儿院的改革。

您致以兄弟般的问候的

茱迪

星期一，三点





亲爱的长腿：

不要因为我的缩写觉得被冒犯，好吗？这不算是一封信，只是一行字，要告诉您考试结束以后我会很快写信给您。我不仅要通过考试，还得考得优秀。我要靠奖学金生活啊。

您勤奋的

茱迪

2月11日





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

库勒校长今天晚上就“轻率肤浅的年轻一代”这个话题发表了一番演讲。他说我们正在失去勤奋执着的品质，不再抱有成为真正学者的理想，尤其是我们中很多人对权威明显缺乏尊重，对长者没有适当的尊崇。

离开礼拜堂的时候我变得非常清醒。

是不是我太自来熟了，叔叔？我是不是应该对您更庄重一些，保持一些距离？是的，我想应该如此，让我们重新开始吧。





我亲爱的史密斯先生：

听说我成功通过期中考试您一定很高兴吧！现在已经开始了新学期的学习。我不学化学了——已经学完了定性分析——刚刚开始生物学课程的学习。我对修这科有一点犹豫，因为需要解剖蚯蚓和青蛙。

上个星期在小礼拜堂我们听了一场非常有意思而且颇具价值的演讲，主题是关于法国南部的罗马遗迹。就这一主题，我以前从来没听过如此有启发性的内容。

英国文学课上，我们正在学习华兹华斯的《丁登寺旁》，这真是一部精致的作品，巧妙地表达了他泛神论的观点！以雪莱、拜伦、济慈和华兹华斯的作品为代表的十九世纪初的浪漫主义运动，比在此之前的古典时期作品更能吸引我。讲到诗歌，您有没有读过丁尼生那首被称为《洛克斯利田庄》的精彩短诗？

我最近的体育课很规律，学校现在实行学监系统管理，违反规定会导致很多麻烦。体育馆有一个水泥和大理石砌成的游泳池，非常漂亮，是以前的毕业生捐赠的。我的室友迈克布莱德小姐把她的游泳衣送给了我（因为缩水，她穿不下了），我计划开始学游泳。

昨天晚上，我们的甜点是美味的粉色冰淇淋。无论是从卫生还是美学角度讲，学校都反对使用色素，所以只用植物色素给食物染色。

过去几天的天气非常好——阳光明亮偶尔有几场大家都很欢迎的大雪降临。我和同伴喜欢步行往返于教室和宿舍之间——特别是从教室散步回来。

我亲爱的史密斯先生，祝您身体健康，一如往昔。

我依旧是您最诚挚的

杰瑞莎·艾伯特

3月5日





亲爱的叔叔：

春天再次来临！您真该看看校园有多么可爱，我想您会亲自来看看的吧，上个星期五杰维少爷又来拜访了——他来的时机不对，茱莉娅、萨莉和我赶火车去了。您猜我们去了哪里？去普林斯顿大学参加舞会和棒球赛。我事先没有问您让不让我去，因为我觉得您的秘书会说不行。但这是很平常的事，我们从学校请假出来，迈克布莱德太太陪我们一起去。真是一段非常美好的时光，不过我还是不一一细述了，太多也太复杂了。

4月24日





天亮以前就起床了！巡夜的叫醒了我们六个。我们用暖锅煮了咖啡。（您绝对没见过这么多咖啡渣！）然后步行两英里到一座名叫“一棵树”的山的山顶去看日出，最后的一道斜坡我们是爬着上去的！差一点就没赶上日出！回来吃早餐的时候大家吃得狼吞虎咽！



亲爱的叔叔，今天我好像很感慨，这页纸上落满了感叹号。

我本来打算写很多东西的，写写刚刚发芽的树、田径场上那条新铺的煤渣跑道、明天那堂可怕的生物课，还有湖面上那些崭新的小船，凯瑟琳·普丽蒂丝得了肺炎。院长那只安哥拉小猫从家里跑出来，在费格森楼住了两个星期，直到服务员发现了它。还有我有三件新衣服——白色、粉色、蓝色的圆点上衣，还配了一顶帽子——但是我太困了。我总在找借口，对不对？不过女子大学太忙了，每天结束时我们都觉得很累！特别是清晨天还没亮就得起床的时候。

这就是院长那只小猫，看它的毛多长！



挚爱您的

茱迪

星期六





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

坐在车里，只是直直往前看，不看任何人，这是不是礼貌呢？

今天有一个非常漂亮的年轻姑娘，穿着非常漂亮的紫罗兰色衣服上了车，面无表情地盯着吊袜带广告，看了足足有十五分钟之久。无视别人存在似乎不太好呢，好像你自己最重要。不管怎么说，那会错过很多东西。在她专心地看着那张傻瓜广告时，我正在研究满车子有意思的人呢。

随信附上一幅画。看上去像蛛丝尽头上挂着一只蜘蛛，实际上不是，那是我在体育馆学游泳呢。



教练用一根绳子系在我的腰环后面，绳子是从天花板上的一个滑轮穿过来的。要是对教练的正直品质非常有信心的话，那么这个办法还是很不错的。然而，我还是害怕，怕她把绳子弄松了，所以我一直很焦虑，一只眼睛盯着她，另外一只眼睛游泳用。如果不是这样的话，我游泳应该会有进步的。

最近我们这里的天气变化无常，刚刚开始写信的时候还在下雨，而这会儿呢，阳光灿烂。萨莉和我要出去打网球，这样的话就不用去体育馆了。

5月15日





这封信早就该写完了，但我还没写完。要是我不经常这样的话，您不会介意，对吧，叔叔？我真的很喜欢给您写信，这给我一种有家的感觉。您愿意我告诉您一件事吗？您不是我唯一通信的男人，还有另外两个！今年冬天，杰维少爷给我写了一封长信，信写得很漂亮（信封上的字是打字机打的，这样茱莉娅就认不出字迹来了）。多让人吃惊！还有，差不多每个星期都会有一封非常潦草的信从普林斯顿大学寄过来，常常用的是黄色便笺。我就像回商务信件一样迅速回复这些信件。所以您明白了吧，叔叔，我和别的女孩子一样，我也会收到信件。

我有没有告诉过您，我被选进高年级戏剧俱乐部了？这个组织很难加入，一千个人里面才选七十五个。作为一名始终不渝的社会主义者，您认为我应该加入吗？

您猜我最近对什么社会学话题感兴趣？我在写（请您想象一下！）一篇有关关注孩子独立性的论文。教授随便拟了一些题目，又把题目随机分给我们，这个题目就落到我身上了。好玩吧？

晚饭钟声响了，路过信箱的时候我会把信寄出去。

挚爱您的

茱迪

一周后





亲爱的叔叔：

真是非常忙的一段时间——十天后有毕业典礼，明天要考试，要背一大堆的东西，还得收拾东西，外面的世界如此可爱，待在屋里真是种伤害。

不过没关系，假期就快到啦。茱莉娅今年夏天出国——这已经是第四次了。叔叔，毫无疑问，贫富不均。萨莉和以往一样到阿迪朗达克消夏。您猜猜我呢？三次机会。罗克维罗？错。和萨莉一起去阿迪朗达克？错。（我再也不想了，去年我很沮丧。）您能不能猜点别的？您真是没有想象力。叔叔，如果您保证不竭力反对的话，我就告诉您。我要提前警告您的秘书，这回我已经下定了决心。

我要到海边同查尔斯·帕特森太太消夏，同时辅导她今年秋天上大学的女儿。我是通过迈克布莱德一家认识她的，她是个非常有魅力的女人。我也教她的小女儿英文和拉丁文，不过我会给自己留点时间的。一个月五十美元！您是不是觉得这价格太高了？是她这么提的，让我自己开口的话，多于二十五美元都会让我脸红了。

我在马格诺利亚待到9月1号（她住在那儿），之后剩余的三个星期可能会在罗克维罗——我会很高兴见到森普尔一家以及那些友好的动物的。

我的计划让您吃惊了吗，叔叔？您看，我现在变得很独立了，是您使我站起来，而如今，我想我几乎可以自己走路啦。

我们的考试和普林斯顿的毕业典礼相冲突，这真是突如其来的打击。萨莉和我都很想参加，但很明显，这根本不可能。

再见，叔叔。好好地过个夏天，秋天回来好好休息，准备下一年的功课（这些原本是您应该写给我的话），我不知道您夏天都会做些什么，您怎么娱乐呢，我也看不见您身处的环境。您玩高尔夫、打猎、骑马，还是只坐在太阳下沉思？

无论如何，不管怎么过，都要好好享受，不要忘了茱迪。

6月4日





亲爱的叔叔：

这是我写得最为艰难的一封信，但是我想我必须要写，没有任何回旋余地。您真是太好、太慷慨了，竟然想今年夏天送我去欧洲——我一时间真的为这个提议陶醉了，然而静下来一想，我还是得说不。我拒绝您出钱送我上大学，转而用您的钱玩乐，这太不合逻辑！您不能让我太过习惯于奢侈的享受。一个人是永远也不会想念自己从来不曾拥有的东西的，但一旦认定这些东西生来就是他（她）的，以后没有这些东西继续生活就会变得很困难。和萨莉、茱莉娅住在一起，对我的斯多葛哲学(14)已经很有压力了。从婴儿时她们就拥有很多，她们把幸福视为理所当然。她们觉得但凡她们想要的，世界都该给她们，或许是世界的确欠她们吧——不管怎么样，世界认可这些债务，而且也打算偿还。但对我来说，世界不欠我任何东西，一开始就已经明明白白地告诉了我。我没有权利负债，总会有一天，世界会拒绝我的要求。

我似乎是在笨拙地做比喻——但是我希望您能明白我的意思。总之，我有种强烈的感觉，对我而言，唯一可靠的事情就是这个夏天去做家教，开始自己养活自己。

6月10日





我有很多事要写——您猜猜发生了什么？服务员送来了杰维少爷的卡片。今年夏天他也要出国，孤身一人，不是和茱莉娅以及她家人。我告诉他您请我和一位女士一起出国，这位女士还要带一大堆女孩。他知道您的，叔叔，就是说他知道我父母双亡，有位绅士送我读大学。我就是没有勇气告诉他约翰·格里尔之家和其他事。他以为您是我的监护人，我们家族的一个正经朋友。我从来没有说过我根本不认识您，这听起来太离奇了！

总之，他还是坚持让我去欧洲。他说这是我教育中必需的一部分，我不应该有任何拒绝的想法。还有，他那段时间也在巴黎，有机会我们可以从陪伴人的身边溜走，去一些很不错的、有趣的异域餐馆共进晚餐。

好吧，叔叔，那的确很吸引我！我几乎动摇，如果他不是这么专制，我就已经完全动摇了。我可以被一步步地诱惑，但是没有人可以强迫我。他说我很傻、很蠢、没有理性，是堂吉诃德式的狂想家、白痴一样顽固的小孩子（这只是他辱骂的形容词中很少的一部分，其他的我都不记得了）。我不知道怎么办才好，应该有个年长的人帮我拿主意。我们几乎吵了起来——我不敢肯定，但我们真的有过争执。

无论如何，我很快就收拾好行李到了这里。我想，在我写完这封信之前，我最好能看见身后的桥，也就是我的退路着火了，到了这会儿，已然化为灰烬。现在，我已经到“悬崖顶”（帕特顿太太的农庄的名字）了，我随身带的东西已经收拾好了，弗罗伦丝（那个年纪小一点的孩子）已经在绞尽脑汁地学习第一变格法了，可能真是场苦战！她是个被惯坏的小孩，我应该教她的第一件事就是怎么学习。她这辈子从来没有把精神集中在比冰淇淋、苏打水更难的事情上过。

我们把崖上一个安静的角落当教室，帕特森太太希望我在户外教她们，我得说这个样子很难不让我把注意力集中到眼前的蓝色的海洋、路过的船只上。我想象着自己身在其中某条船上，往国外驶去——但是我不会让自己去想除了拉丁语法之外的事。

前置词a或者ab，absque，coram，cum，de，e，或者ex，prae，pro，sinetenus，in，subter，sub，还有super引导夺格。

您看，叔叔，我已经坚定地拒绝了诱惑，让自己投入到工作中去。不要责备我，求求您了，不要觉得我不领情，因为我永远永远地感激您。我能回报给您的，只有让自己成为一个有用的公民。（女公民？我觉得妇女不算公民。）不管怎么样，当一个有用的人吧。在您面对我的时候，您可以说：“我交给世界一个有用的人。”

听起来很不错，是不是，叔叔？但我不愿意误导您，我常常觉得自己一点都不出色。计划将来的事业很有趣，但我很有可能变成一个与其他任何普通人没有分毫不同的人，也许最终嫁给了一个殡仪员，给他的工作以灵感。

您永远的

茱迪

四日后于蒙格诺利亚





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

从我的窗户望出去，是一片可爱到极致的美景——海景——水和岩石以外，再也没别的了。

夏天过去了。我每天上午的时间都花在拉丁文、英文、代数和那两个笨女孩身上。我真不明白怎么玛丽恩也能上大学，或者说怎么上了大学也能待得下去。而弗罗伦丝呢，她真是无可救药——但是，哦！她真是个小美人，我想她们蠢不蠢也不重要，只要漂亮就可以了。不会思考的女人会让丈夫厌倦，除非幸运地嫁了个同样蠢的丈夫。我想这是极有可能的，这个世界上挤满了愚蠢的男人，这个夏天我就碰见了不少。

下午的时候我们在悬崖上散步，或者去游泳，如果潮水平稳的话。我可以轻松地在海水里游泳了——您看，我受到的教育已经发挥了用处。

杰维少爷在巴黎给我写了封信，很短很简练。他还没有原谅我拒绝他的建议。但他要是能及时回来，开学前他会来罗克维罗看我，若是我乖巧、甜蜜、顺从，我应该（这是我推断的）能重新得到他的喜爱。

萨莉也给我写了封信，她想让我九月份和她们一起野营，两个星期的时间。我是不是该得到您的许可，或许我还没到高兴做什么就做什么的地步吧？是的，我确定我可以了——我是大四学生了，您知道这一点。工作了一整个夏天，现在我想做一些有益健康的消遣，我想去阿迪朗达克，我想看看萨莉，我想看看萨莉的哥哥——他会教我划船——并且（现在谈到了我的主要动机，它就是）我想等杰维少爷到达罗克维罗的时候发现我不在那里了。

我必须要让他知道，他不能指挥我。除了您以外，没有人可以指挥我，叔叔——您也不能永远指挥我！我要出发去树林了。

茱迪

8月19日





亲爱的叔叔：

您的信没有准时到达（我很高兴这样）。要是您希望我遵从您的指示，您应该让您的秘书至少在两个星期前拍电报。如您所知，我已经在这里了，都待了五天了。

这里的林子很好，营地很好，天气很好，迈克布莱德一家也很好，整个世界都很好。我真是太高兴了！

杰米叫我去划船——再见，对不起，没有执行您的指示，但是您干吗坚持不让我玩呢？我工作了一个夏天，该得到两个星期的时间。您真坏，自己不玩也不许我玩！

不过，叔叔，尽管您有这些缺点，我还是爱您。

茱迪

9月16日

于迈克布莱德宿营地





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

回到学校，我已经是个大四学生了，还当上了《月刊》编辑，听起来不像真的，对吗？如今这么成熟的一个人，四年之前还只是约翰·格里尔之家的一员呢！美国变化太快了！

您有什么想法？杰维少爷寄给罗克维罗的一张便条转到了这里，他很抱歉他不能来了，他受到邀请和几个朋友一起去乘游艇旅游。他祝我过个美好的夏天，享受在乡间的日子。

他知道我和迈克布莱德家人在一起了，是茱莉娅告诉他的！男人应该给女人留下点秘密，不要提起一丁点儿！茱莉娅买了一大箱漂亮的新衣服，有一件利伯蒂纱的晚礼服，像是给天堂里的天使穿的。而且我觉得我今年的衣服简直空前的（这样说对吗？）漂亮。在一个收费低廉的裁缝的帮助下，我复制了帕特森太太的许多衣服，尽管看起来并不完全像原件，之前我也很高兴。但是，等茱莉娅一打开衣箱，我就盼着有一天能去看看巴黎了！

亲爱的叔叔，您是不是很高兴您不是个女孩子？我猜您会认为我们对衣服大惊小怪够傻的。是的，毫无疑问，但这全是你们男人的错。

您有没有听说过渊博的赫尔教授？他对所有不必要的装饰都抱有藐视态度，更愿意女人穿知性、实用的衣服。他的妻子乐于助人，接受了他的“服装革新”。您猜他做了什么？他跟一个合唱团的女郎私奔了。

您永远的

茱迪

10月3日

及：在我们这层楼打扫房间的女服务员总穿蓝色花格棉布的围裙，我想让她换件灰的，把蓝色的扔到湖底去。每次看见它们，我都会想起冰冷的往事。





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

我的文学生涯遭到了如此沉重的打击。我不知道该不该告诉您，但是我需要一点同情——无声的同情，求求您。下封信不要提这事，不要把伤口再一次撕裂。

我一直在写一本书，去年整个冬天我每天晚上都写，整个夏天不用教那两个笨孩子拉丁语的时候也在写。开学前我刚写完，然后寄给了一个出版商。他拿了我的稿子两个月，我以为他一定会出版，但是昨天上午，我收到一件特快包裹（三十美分到付），出版商把稿子退了出来，还有一封信附在稿子后头，一封非常友善、父亲般慈爱的信——但是，坦率地说吧！他说从地址上看出来我还在读书，要是我愿意听听他的忠告，他希望我把所有的精力都放在学习上，等毕业以后再写作。他还附了读后感，是这样的：

“情节不现实。人物描述夸张。对话不自然。成堆的幽默，但品味不高。告诉她继续尝试吧，早晚能写出一本真正的书。”

一点点恭维也没有，对吗，叔叔？而我本来以为我会给美国文学添了很重要的一笔呢。我真是这么想的。我想毕业以前出一本小说，给您一个惊喜。去年圣诞节在茱莉娅家的时候，我就在收集素材了。不过我想编辑是对的，可能只用两个星期去观察一座大城市的社交礼仪、风俗习惯根本就不够。

昨天下午我带着书稿去散步，当我走到煤气房，我进去问工程师能不能借用他的炉子。他很有礼貌地打开了门，我亲手把稿子扔进了火炉。感觉就像亲手火化自己唯一的孩子！

昨天晚上上床的时候，我很沮丧。我觉得自己什么也做不了，您的钱都白扔了。不过，您怎么想呢？今天早上起来的时候，我的脑子里又有了一幅美丽蓝图。一整天我都在勾画我书中的人物，我很开心。没有人能因为我的乐观而责备我！要是有一天我的丈夫和十二个孩子在地震中被埋到了地底下，第二天我就会微笑着打起精神，开始找寻另外的生活。

挚爱您的

茱迪

11月17日





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

昨天晚上我做了一个特别好玩的梦。我梦见自己进了一家书店，书店的工作人员给我看一本书，名叫《茱迪·艾伯特的生平与书信》。我很清楚地看到了这本书——红色的书壳，封面有一张约翰·格里尔之家的照片，卷首扉页是我的照片，照片下面写着“您真诚的，茱迪·艾伯特”，但是我翻到最后去读我的墓志铭时，我醒来了。真讨厌！我差一点就知道自己嫁给了谁以及什么时候死掉了！

如果真的读到一个坦诚的作者为您的一生写下的真实传记，您想是不是很有意思？假如要求你读过了之后永远不会忘记将发生的一切，并经历这一切，事先准确地知道将会发生什么事，也能预见你死去的时间，您想会有多少人有勇气看完呢？或者说有多少人能够压制自己的好奇心不看呢？这种阅读的代价就是生命中不再会有希望，也没有惊喜了！

生命其实够单调了，就是吃吃睡睡而已。想一想就知道，要是两顿饭之间并没有什么意料之外的事情发生，生活是有多么恐怖单调呀！糟糕！叔叔，滴了一滴墨迹，不过已经第三页了，我不想重写啦。

今年我还是继续选修生物——这门课很有意思，我们现在正在学的是消化系统，您真该来看看在显微镜底下，猫的十二指肠横切面有多可爱！

我们还在学哲学——有意思，但是趣味很快就消失了。我更喜欢生物课，可以把要学的东西钉在黑板上。又滴！又滴！这钢笔哭起来没完没了，请原谅它的泪水吧！

您相信自由意志吗？我相信——毫无保留地相信。我一点也不同意那些哲学家认为“每个行为都出于必然，都是不相干的原因综合作用下自动产生的结果”的观点。这是我听说过的最不道德的教条了——这样谁都不用为任何事情负责。要是有人相信宿命论，那么他可以自然地坐下来，然后说：“上帝会安排的。”就这么坐到倒下死掉为止。

我绝对相信自己的自由意志，自己的力量能够让我达到目标——这是一种可以移山的信念，您会看到我成为一个伟大作家！我的新书已经完成四章了，另外的五章拟了草稿。

这封信玄而又玄——您头疼了吧，叔叔？现在咱们就说再见吧。我要做奶油软糖去了。真抱歉我没法给您寄一颗去，真是太棒了呢！我们要用真正的奶油和三团黄油球做呢。

您真挚的

及：我们在体育馆上课的时候学跳舞了。您能看到我随信附的画，看看我们多么像真正的芭蕾舞演员。最后一个优雅地单脚尖旋转的就是我。





我亲爱的、亲爱的长腿叔叔：

您还有没有理智？您不知道不应该送给一个女孩十七件圣诞礼物吗？请记住，我是个社会主义者啊，您不会想把我变成一个财阀吧？

想想我们曾有过的争执多尴尬！我应该雇一辆搬家车把礼物还给您。



真是不好意思，送给您的是一条歪歪斜斜的领带，那是我自己用双手织的（您可能已经看出来了吧）。您可以在天气冷的时候戴上，把衣服扣紧了遮住它。

谢谢您，叔叔，一千次的感谢。我认为您是这世界上最贴心的男人——还是最傻的。

茱迪

12月26日

及：这儿有一枚从迈克布莱德宿营地摘来的四片叶子的三叶草，在新的一年里它会给您带来好运。





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

您想做点好事给自己永久的救赎吗，叔叔？有一家人陷入了绝望的困境。父母两个人以及四个还在家的孩子——两个年龄大些的男孩失踪了，他们去闯世界赚钱，还没寄回一分钱。爸爸以前在玻璃厂工作，得了痨病——那是一份对健康非常有害的工作——现在他住院了，花去了他们所有的积蓄。生活的重担落在了大女儿身上，她今年二十四岁，每天做衣服赚一块五美元，这是有活儿的时候，晚上就绣一些装饰品。她妈妈身体不好，根本就不能工作，是个很虔诚的人，总是双手合十地坐着，一脸的耐心和顺从。她的女儿则被过度劳作、责任和焦虑消耗着，她不知道一家人怎样才能度过这个冬天——其实我也不知道。一百美元就够给这家人买一些煤，给三个孩子各买一双鞋让他们去上学，还能给她留点钱，让她不至于因为自己哪天没活干就担心得要死。

我认识的最富有的人就是您了，您愿意施舍一百块钱吗？这个女孩比我更值得帮助，要不是因为她，我不会向您请求什么的。我不太关心那个妈妈——她是个懦夫。

我不喜欢这种人。这种人的眼神总是跟着上天起起浮浮，他们说：“也许这一切都是最好的安排。”其实他们自己心里都十分明白，根本不是这样。这简直让我发火。仁慈、顺从或者随便叫什么吧，其实就是没有力量的懒惰！我支持更有进取心的宗教！

我们现在正在学的是哲学中最可怕的内容——明天全是关于叔本华。教授好像根本没意识到我们也选修了其他学科，他是只古怪的老鸭子，总是不切实际，偶尔脚踏实地一次，就会晕头转向。他想用偶尔的俏皮话来活跃气氛——我们就尽可能地笑。但我向您发誓，他的笑话一点也不好笑。他所有的时间都花在思考事物是否真的存在，还是只是他认为它存在。

我敢肯定缝衣服的女孩一点也不怀疑事物的存在！

您猜猜我的小说现在在哪里？废纸篓里。我自己知道它不怎么样，要是严谨的作者都能意识到这一点，那么，挑剔的读者又会有什么评价呢？




及：我躺在床上忍着痛给您写信，我因为扁桃体发炎，已经躺在床上两天了，只能喝喝热牛奶。“为什么你小的时候父母不给你切除扁桃体？”医生问。我不知道，我怀疑他们有没有想起过我。

您的

茱迪

稍后几天

在封口之前我又读了一遍。不知道为什么我这么忧伤。我要赶紧向您保证，我年轻、快乐、精力充沛，相信您也是如此。青春和年龄无关，只和精神活力有关，就算您的头发已经灰白，叔叔，您还可以是个男孩子。

挚爱您的

茱迪

翌晨





亲爱的慈善家：

您给那家人的支票昨天已经收到。太感谢您了！我午饭后逃了体育课，直接把支票带给他们了。您真应该看看那个女孩子的脸，她那么惊讶、那么高兴、那么如释重负，看起来年轻了许多。其实她也只有二十四岁。真可怜。

不管怎么样，她现在的感觉就是好事一起来了，她现在有了一份能维持两个月的稳定工作——因为有人结婚，要做嫁妆。

“感谢仁慈的上帝！”当那位妈妈弄清楚那张小纸片是100美元时，她叫了起来。

“根本和上帝没关系，”我说，“是长腿叔叔。”（我说的是史密斯先生。）

“是仁慈的上帝让他这么做的。”她回答。

“根本不是！是我让他这么做的。”我说。

但是，总而言之，叔叔，我相信仁慈的上帝会赐福给您，您可以免受万年炼狱之苦。

您心怀感激的

茱迪·艾伯特

最最尊贵的阁下：

是日清晨吾用餐为冷火鸡派、鹅肉，另饮一杯从不曾品尝的中国茶。

别紧张，叔叔，我没有发疯呢。我只是在引用塞缪尔·皮普斯，最近英国历史课我们在读他的东西，原始资料。萨莉、茱莉娅和我现在喜欢用1660年的语言谈话。听听这个：

“吾赴查令十字街，观处哈里森市长以绞刑，取内脏分肢体，其面不改色。”再看看这个：“与夫人共餐，神色悲怆，盖因其弟昨日死于斑疹伤寒。”

好像现在开始逗笑早了一点，是不是？皮普斯的朋友出了个馊主意，让国王把腐坏的食物卖给穷人以筹资还款。您是一位革新人士，这事您怎么看？我不相信今天的我们像报纸上说的那么糟糕。

塞缪尔对衣服就像个姑娘那么在意，他在衣服上花去的时间有他太太的五倍之多——那是个丈夫们的黄金时代。是不是太有趣了？他真是诚实啊。“今日金钮羽纱披风送抵，价格不菲，求上帝赐福清偿。”

原谅我一再地提皮普斯，我正在写一篇关于他的论文。

叔叔，学会自治协会废除了晚上十点钟熄灯的规定，您怎么想？要是我们愿意，可以整晚都亮着灯，唯一的要求就是不要打扰别人——不许我们大规模地招待客人。这种改变是对人性最漂亮的注解。现在可以高兴几点睡就几点睡，我们反而不熬夜了。九点钟就开始点头打瞌睡，九点半笔就从无力的手中掉了下来。这会儿已经九点半了。晚安。

2月15日

刚从教堂里回来——今天的传教士是从佐治亚州来。他说，我们必须小心，不要牺牲情感天性去培养智能。然以吾之见，此乃穷极无聊、枯燥无味之布道（又是皮普斯）。不管他们是从加拿大还是美国哪里来的，我们总是在听一模一样的布道。为什么他们不去男校布道，督促他们不要让自己的天性被过多的智力活动扑灭？

这真是美好的一天——冰天雪地、清爽宜人。刚吃完晚饭，萨莉、茱莉娅、马蒂·基恩、埃莉诺·普拉特（我的朋友，但是您不认识她们）和我就打算穿上短裙，穿过乡间小路，去水晶春天庄园吃炸鸡和华夫饼干，水晶春天先生赶着四轮马车送我们回来，本来应该是七点钟左右返校，但我们打算耽搁一点，八点钟才回来。

再会，好心的先生。

我很荣幸地签上自己的名字。

您最最忠诚的、有责任感的、可信的、顺从的仆人

茱迪·艾伯特

星期日





亲爱的理事先生：

明天是这个月的第一个星期三——要是还在约翰·格里尔之家的话，这就是个讨厌的日子。一到五点钟，您拍拍他们的脑袋就走了，大家都是多么如释重负啊！您有没有单独拍过我的脑袋？我相信是没有的——我的记忆当中似乎只有一些肥胖的理事。

请将我的爱转达约翰·格里尔之家——我真挚的爱。经过四年模糊的岁月再回头望望，对这个家我充满了温柔的情感。刚上大学的时候我满怀怨恨，因为我被剥夺了正常的童年，而其他女孩子都有。而现在，我丝毫没有这样的感觉了。我把它视为一段非同寻常的经历，它给了我一种有利的视角，我得以茁壮地成长，站在一旁观察人生，对世界保有特别的看法。而那些在富裕环境长大的人完全不会有这样的视角。

我认识许多许多女孩子（譬如茱莉娅），她们从来都不知道自己是快乐的。她们太习惯幸福了，以至于感受能力被削弱了。但是我不一样，我非常肯定我生命里的每一刻都快乐，而且要继续这么快乐下去，不管发生了什么不快乐的事，我都会拿它当有趣的经历（哪怕是牙疼），而且会很高兴体验与感受。“不管我头顶是什么样的天空，我的心已经准备好迎接任何命运的挑战。”

不过，叔叔，不要把我对约翰·格里尔之家的新情感看得太认真了。即使我也像卢梭一样有五个孩子，我也不会像他一样，为了让他们得到朴素的教育就把他们放到孤儿院门口的台阶上。

向李佩特太太带去我最友好的问候（我想这是真诚的，要是说爱的话，就过分了点），不要忘记告诉她，我已经长成了一个品行端正的人。

挚爱您的

茱迪

3月5日





亲爱的叔叔：

您注意到邮戳了吗？复活节的时候，萨莉和我到了罗克维罗。十天的假期，我们觉得能做的最好的事就是找一处安静的地方。我们的神经已经到临界点了，再也没法忍受费格森楼哪怕只是一顿饭了。当你感到疲劳的时候，和四百个女孩子在一个房间吃饭太可怕了。那么多噪音，你都听不清对面的人在讲什么，除非手里塞一个麦克风大喊大叫。这是真的。

我们爬山、读书、写作，过了一段悠闲的美好时光。今天一大早，我们爬到了斯盖山的山顶，在这里我和杰维少爷曾做过一回晚餐——简直不敢相信，已经是两年前的事情了。我还能清楚地看见石头被烟火熏黑的痕迹。有些地方和有些人紧密联系在一起，很有意思。没有他我真的很孤独——有两分钟是这样的。

您对我最近的活动有什么看法，叔叔？您认为我无可救药吗——我在写书，三个星期以前开始写的，速度非常快。我找到了写作的奥秘，杰维少爷和那个编辑是对的，写熟悉的事情才有说服力。这次我就写了自己熟悉的事情——用尽全力来写。猜猜主题是什么？约翰·格里尔之家！这篇很不错的，叔叔，我真的相信它的确好——只是些每天都在发生的琐碎小事。我如今是个现实主义者，我放弃了浪漫主义。不过，将来等我自己开创了具有冒险精神的未来之时，我会回归浪漫的。

这本新书就快写完了——会出版的！要是你非常非常渴望一件事，只要不停地尝试，最终一定会实现的。我试了四年了，盼望能收到您的信——到现在，我仍然没有放弃希望。

再见，叔叔亲爱的。

（我喜欢叫您叔叔亲爱的 (15)，这个称呼正好押头韵。）

挚爱您的

茱迪

4月4日于罗克维罗

及：我忘记告诉您农场的消息了，但只有沮丧的消息。如果您不想感觉焦虑的话，就跳过不看吧。

可怜的老格罗弗死了，它老得无力再咀嚼，所以他们不得不开枪把它打死了。

上个星期九只鸡死了，被黄鼠狼或者臭鼬、老鼠咬死的。

一头牛病了，我们不得不从邦尼里格十字街角找了个兽医来。阿马塞整夜没睡喂它亚麻籽油、威士忌。但我们怀疑这头可怜的病牛喝到的只有亚麻籽油。

多愁善感的汤米（那只花斑的猫）不见了，我们担心它可能掉进哪个陷阱去了。

世上不幸的事可真是多啊！





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

这封信非常短，因为看到笔我的肩膀就疼。白天都在做课堂笔记，晚上则在写不朽的小说，写东西写太多了。

三个星期之后的礼拜三是毕业典礼，您会来充当我的亲朋好友吗——如果您不来，我会恨您的！茱莉娅请了杰维少爷，他是她的家人；萨莉叫了杰米·迈克布莱德，他是她的家人。但我该请谁呢？只有您和李佩特太太，但我不想叫她。求您了。

爱您的，写到手疼的

茱迪

5月17日





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

我毕业了！桌子最底下的抽屉里放着我的毕业证书和两件最好的衣服。毕业典礼如往常一样，到了关键时刻就下阵雨。谢谢您的玫瑰花，非常可爱。杰维少爷和杰米少爷也都送了我玫瑰花，我把他们送的放在浴缸里，而后捧着您送的参加了典礼。

现在，我在罗克维罗度夏——也可能永远在这里吧。这里的食宿便宜，环境也清静，有益于文学创作。一个正在苦苦奋斗的作家还能希望些什么呢？我已经快为自己的书发疯了，醒着的时候每分每秒都在想它，睡着了梦里也在想着它。我只希望能清静，还希望有很多很多工作时间（间隙要有营养丰富的饭菜）。

八月份杰维少爷会来待一个星期左右。杰米·迈克布莱德也会在夏天的什么时候来。他在一家投资银行上班，全国各地跑，向银行兜售债券。他可能会和街角那儿的国家农民银行合作，来的时候顺便看看我。

您瞧，罗克维罗也不是完全与社会脱节的。我盼望您也能来看看——只是我现在知道了，毫无希望，您都没有来参加我的毕业典礼。我已经把您从我的心上抹掉，永远地埋葬了。

茱迪·艾伯特

6月19日于罗克维罗





最最亲爱的长腿叔叔：

工作真有意思——您工作过吗？特别是您的工作正是您最想做的事情时，就更加有意思了。这个夏天，我写作的速度就是钢笔能承受的最高速度了，我对生活唯一的不满就是日子不够长，不能把想到的所有漂亮的、有价值的、有趣的想法都记下来。

我已经完成了我的书的第二遍草稿，明天早上七点半以后我要开始写第三遍。它会是你所看过的最为美妙的书——是真的。除了书，我什么也不想，每天早上我迫不及待地穿好衣服吃点东西，然后就写啊写啊写啊，直到累得精疲力尽，而后和科林出去走走（一只新来的牧羊犬），在田野上嬉戏玩耍，为第二天补充新想法。它将是您所见过的最漂亮的一本书——噢，请原谅——我前面说过了。

您认为我是在空想，对吗？亲爱的叔叔？

不，是真的。只因为我现在处于热情满满的状态，可能不久之后我的热情会冷却，然后变得挑剔而且嗤之以鼻。哦，不会！我保证不会这样！这一次我写的是一本真正的书。等着吧，您会看到的。

我试着拿一分钟来谈点别的事吧。我还没有告诉您吧？阿马塞和凯莉去年五月结婚了。他们还在这里工作，我觉得他们两个都毁了。以前每次他沾了一脚泥，或是把烟灰弄到地板上她就笑。但现在，您真该听听她是怎么责骂人的！而且，她再也不卷头发了。阿马塞，他以前那么热衷于拍干净地毯、扛木头，现在若是你求他干这些事，他还咕咕哝哝、牢骚满腹呢。还有，他以前都戴非常整洁的领带，而现在鲜红、紫色的领带变成了黑色和棕色的。我决定不结婚了，显而易见，婚姻真是一个令人堕落的过程！

农场没有太多消息了。动物们的健康状况都很好，猪不同寻常的肥，牛儿们似乎也过得心满意足，鸡蛋产量也不错。您对家禽有兴趣吗？如果有的话，让我推荐您一部非常有价值的小作品——《每只母鸡年产两百鸡蛋》。我正在考虑明年春天开始用孵卵器，还打算饲养肉用仔鸡。您看，我准备在罗克维罗永远地居住，住到我像安东尼·特罗洛普(16)的妈妈那样写出114本小说。到那时我一生的工作也就结束了，可以退休旅游了。

上个星期天杰米和我们在一起，晚上我们吃了冰淇淋和炸鸡，这两样东西他都很喜欢。我很高兴再见到他，他提醒我外面有更大的世界。杰米的债券很不好卖，日子也难过。尽管他们公司愿付百分之六到七的利息，街角的国家农民银行还是不肯跟他们合作。我想他最后会回伍斯特的家中，在他父亲的工厂里找一份工作。他的性格过于开朗，过于信任别人，也过于热心了，很难成为一名成功的金融家。不过，去一家繁荣兴旺的工装裤厂当经理，是很多人都梦寐以求的工作。您以为呢？虽然现在他表示出对工装裤的蔑视，但最后他会回去的。

我希望您能高兴：这一封长信是由一位因为写字过多而手部痉挛的作家写给您的。我仍然爱您，叔叔亲爱的，我很幸福。周围景色宜人，有很多东西吃，有一张舒服的四柱床、一大堆纸、一品脱墨水——人活在世界上，还想要些什么呢？

您永远的

茱迪

7月24日

及：邮递员带来了新消息。杰维少爷星期五就要到了，会待一个星期。太让人高兴了——我只担心我可怜的书要吃苦头了。杰维少爷是个要求严格的人。





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

您到底在哪里，我是真的想知道。

我从来都不知道您在世界的哪一个角落，不过我希望在这样的季节里，您不在纽约，我希望您在一个山顶（不是瑞士的山顶，在近点的地方）看看雪，想想我。请想想我吧，我真的很孤独，希望有人会惦记我。哦，叔叔，我真希望我能认识您！那样我们不高兴的时候就能互相鼓励了。

我想我是再也受不了罗克维罗了。我想搬走。明年冬天萨莉就要去波士顿做结算工作，您觉得我和她一起去好吗？我们可以共用一个工作室。她工作的时候我写作，晚上我们会在一起。当只有森普尔夫妇、凯莉和阿马塞可以说说话的时候，夜晚显得格外漫长。我知道您不会喜欢这个主意的，现在我就知道您的秘书会怎么来信：

杰瑞莎·艾伯特小姐：




亲爱的女士：

史密斯先生希望您留在罗克维罗。

您真诚的

埃尔默·H. 格里格斯

我恨您的秘书。我可以肯定，一个名字叫埃尔默·H. 格里格斯的男人肯定很讨厌。说真的，叔叔，我认为我应该去波士顿。我不能继续留在这里了。如果短时间里没有点新鲜事，我会在万分绝望之中跳进筒仓里。

上帝啊！这里太热了，小草都烤焦了，小溪也干涸了，道路上灰土飞扬，已经有很多个星期没有下雨了。

听起来我好像得了狂犬病，但是我没有。我只是想要个亲人。

再见，我最最亲爱的叔叔。

希望能认识您的

茱迪

8月27日





亲爱的叔叔：

出了点事情，我需要听听您的意见。这世上没有其他人能给我意见了。有没有可能让我见见您？谈话比写信容易得多，而且，我还怕您的秘书会拆信。

茱迪

9月19日于罗克维罗

又及：我很不开心。





亲爱的长腿叔叔：

是您亲手写的便条——那颤抖的字迹！——我今天早上收到的。我真抱歉，倘若我早知道您生病了的话，就不会拿自己的事来烦您了。我会告诉您麻烦所在的，但是太复杂了，不太好写，而且涉及我的隐私。请不要留着这封信了，看过就烧了吧。

在开始之前，请查收这张一千美元的支票。听来很可笑，是不是，我送支票给您？您想我从哪弄到的？

我把自己的故事卖掉了。叔叔，它会分成七部分连载，然后就出书！您以为我快高兴疯了吗？但是我没有。我无动于衷。当然我很高兴开始还钱给您——我欠您的超过两千美元，我会分期还给您的。现在，不要嫌弃，求您收下它吧，我很高兴能还给您这些钱，我欠您的不只是钱，剩余的我会用一生的感激和深情来偿还您的。

现在，叔叔，是其他的事情，请您给予我您最深思熟虑的意见，别管我喜欢不喜欢，好吗？

您知道我对您的感情是特殊的，您代表了我的整个家庭，但如果我告诉您我对另一个男人有更特殊的感情，您不会介意吧？您也许不费力气都可以猜出是谁。我想很长时间以来，我的信里写的全是杰维少爷。

我希望我能让您明白他是个什么样的人，我们多么性情相投。我们对每件事的看法都是一样的——我担心我会为了和他的观点一致而改造自己的思想！但是他几乎总是正确的！他应该这样，他比我大十四岁呢。另一方面，他也只是个成长过快的大男孩，他也需要别人照顾——他竟然没有一点下雨天应该穿胶鞋的意识。他和我觉得好玩的东西是一样的，这样的事情太多了！要是两个人的幽默感是对立的就糟糕了，这种鸿沟是没有桥梁可以沟通的！

他是——噢，好吧，他只是他，我想念他，想念他，想念他。整个世界似乎都是一片空虚，都令人心痛，我恨月光，因为月光这么漂亮，而他却不在这里和我一起欣赏。也许您也爱过谁。您知道这种感受吗？如果您有过，我就不用解释了；如果您没有，我也解释不清。

不管怎么样，我是这样感觉的——而我已经拒绝嫁给他了。

我没有告诉他为什么，只是默默地忍受痛苦。我想不到有什么可说的了。现在他走了，以为我想要嫁给杰米·迈克布莱德——我一点都不想，我怎么也不会想到要嫁给杰米，他还没有长大呢。但杰维少爷和我陷入了误会的泥潭，我们相互伤害。我让他走的原因不是我不在乎他，而是因为我太在乎他，我害怕他将来会后悔——我无法忍受！我这样一个血缘不明的人嫁给他这种家庭背景的人太不合适了！我从没有告诉他孤儿院的事情，我不愿意解释我不知道自己是谁。我可能是很可怕的，您是知道的。他的家庭很骄傲——而我也是很骄傲的！

同样，我也感觉到多少对您是有义务的，您想把我培养成作家，我至少要努力尝试。我不能先接受您所给予的教育，而后一走了之，不去用这些知识，这对您不公平。现在我还了一部分钱，我感觉自己已经部分从债务中解放出来了——而且就算我结婚了，我也可以是个作家。这两样并不相互冲突。

我苦苦思索。他是个社会主义者，许多观念并不保守，也许他不会像很多男人那样介意自己娶的是个无产阶级。可能，两个人要是性情相合的话，在一起就快乐，分开就孤独，不应该让世上任何事情阻碍他们在一起！当然我希望这是真的！然而，我希望能听听您客观的看法。您可能也出身于名门望族，您可以站在世俗的角度看待这个问题，而不仅是同情和人性——您能明白我把这个问题放在您面前需要有多大的勇气啊！

要是我到他面前，跟他解释问题不是杰米，而是约翰·格里尔之家——这对我来说不是太可怕了吗？这需要太多太多的勇气，而我宁可我的余生在悲惨中度过。

这已经是两个月以前的事情了，他走后音讯全无。我已经开始慢慢习惯心碎的感觉了，而茱莉娅的一封信把我又搅乱了。她偶然地提到，“杰维叔叔”在加拿大打猎的时候被困在暴风雪里整整一夜，得了肺炎。我丝毫不知道这件事。我伤心极了，因为他一句话也没说就消失了。我知道他很痛苦，我知道我自己也很痛苦！

您觉得我该怎么办？

茱迪

10月3日于罗克维罗





最亲爱的长腿叔叔：

是的，我当然会去——下星期三下午四点半。我会找到路的，我去过纽约三次，我不是个小孩子了。我简直不敢相信我真的要去看您了——我想您想了这么久，到现在都很难相信您是真的切实存在的、有血有肉的人。

叔叔，在您自己也不算健康的时候我还打扰你，您真是个好人。注意身体，不要感冒了。雨下得很大。

挚爱您的

茱迪

10月6日

又及：我有一个很可怕的念头。您有男管家吗？我怕管家，要是有人开门，我怕我会晕倒在台阶上。我该对他怎么说呢？您没有告诉过我您的名字，我是不是该找史密斯先生呢？





我最最亲爱的杰维少爷——长腿叔叔——彭德莱顿·史密斯：

昨天晚上你睡了吗？我没有，甚至没能闭上眼睛。我实在太吃惊、太兴奋、太不知所措、太开心了。我不相信我能睡着，也不相信自己能吃得下东西。但是我希望你能睡着，必须要这样，你知道，这样你会快些好起来，就可以来看我了。

亲爱的，我没法承受你病得这么重——而我自始至终都不知道。昨天医生送我上出租车时，他告诉我有三天他们都打算放弃你了。哦，最亲爱的人，要是这样的事情发生，这世界将会永远一片黑暗。我想会有一天——在很远的将来——我们中的一人会离开对方，但那个时候，至少我们拥有自己的快乐，能够和记忆一起生活。

我想让你快乐起来——必须先得让自己快乐起来，尽管我已经比我之前渴望的更快乐了，但也是更为忧郁了。担心你出事的恐惧像是阴影覆在我的心上。以前我总能轻率地毫不在乎、无忧无虑，因为我没什么宝贵的东西可以失去。但是现在——我余生中有了沉重的忧虑。只要你不在我身边，我就会想到汽车可能会撞到你，或者广告牌会砸到你脑袋上，更或者焦虑地想你会不会咽下了蠕动的可怕细菌。我心灵的宁静永远地失去了——但我不在乎那种苍白的宁静。

请痊愈吧——快——快——快，我想要靠近你，在那里，我能够触摸你，能够感觉到你的存在。我们在一起只待了半个小时！我真害怕那只是一场梦！要是我是你某个家人，即使是第四个远房表妹，我就可以每天都去看你，为你大声地朗读，为你撑起枕头，舒展你前额那两条小小的细纹，让你的嘴角向上扬出一个美好的微笑来。现在你开心了吗？昨天我离开之前你是开心的。医生说我一定是个好护士，你看上去年轻了十岁。我真希望相爱不会让人都年轻十岁，要是我变成十一岁，你依然会关心我吗，亲爱的？

昨天是我生命中最最精彩的一天了。就算我活到了九十九岁，也不会忘掉昨天最为细微的细节。那个黎明时分离开罗克维罗的女孩，和晚上回来时相比根本就不像同一个人。森普尔太太凌晨四点半时叫醒我，我在黑暗中睁大眼睛，冒出的第一个念头就是：“我要去见长腿叔叔了！”借着烛光我在厨房里吃了早餐，然后路过10月最华美的缤纷色彩，赶了五英里的路到了车站。半路上太阳升了起来，红枫和山茱萸染上了灿烂的红色、橘色，覆盖着石头墙、玉米田的白霜晶莹透亮，清冷的空气充满了希望。我知道有什么要发生，一路上铁轨都在歌唱：“你要去看长腿叔叔了。”这让我倍感安全。我相信长腿叔叔有能力把一切都安排得井井有条。我知道有个地方有个男人——比叔叔还要亲的男人——想见我。不知道为什么，这趟行程之前我就有种感觉，这次我一定能够见到他。你瞧！

当我到了麦迪逊大街的房子前时，灰暗的宅子看上去那么庞大，而且那么森严，我不敢进去，就围着街区转，让自己鼓足勇气。但我本来不用害怕的，你的管家是个很好的人，像父亲一样和善，一下子就让我感觉像是在自己家。“是艾伯特小姐吗？”他问我。我说：“是的。”我根本就不用说我是来找史密斯先生的，他叫我在客厅里等一下。那是一间很阴沉、很华丽、充满男人气息的屋子，我坐在巨大的椅子边上，不停地对自己说：

“我就要见到长腿叔叔了！我就要见到长腿叔叔了！”

然后管家回来了，让我到书房去。我那么兴奋，双脚几乎动弹不得。他在门外转过身来，小声说：“小姐，他病得很重。这是第一天他能被允许起来。你能不能不要待太长时间让他太兴奋呢？”从他讲话的语气我就知道他爱你——我也觉得他是个和蔼可亲的老人！

然后他敲敲门，说：“艾伯特小姐来了。”我就走进去，门在身后关上了。

刚从明亮的大厅进去时，我几乎什么也看不清楚，而后我看到一把大椅子摆在炉火前，旁边有一张光洁的茶几，茶几旁边有一把小椅子。我认出来大椅子上坐着个人，身体用枕头撑着，膝盖上盖着条毯子。在我能阻止他之前，他自己就已经站起来了——摇摇晃晃地撑住了椅背，一句话也没说，只是望着我，然后——然后——然后，我就看见是你了！但是，就是这样我也没有明白过来，我以为是叔叔让你去给我一个惊喜。

然后你笑了，伸出手来说：“亲爱的小茱迪，你猜不出来我就是长腿叔叔吗？”

一下子就全明白了。我真蠢啊！有一百件小事都曾告诉我真相，但凡我动动脑子。我不是个好侦探，对不对，叔叔？——杰维？我该怎么叫你才好呢？单是杰维听起来似乎不太恭敬呢，我不能对你不尊敬的！

在医生进门把我送走之前，真是甜蜜的半小时呢。直到到了车站时，我还是晕头晕脑的，差点就坐上了去圣路易斯的车。你也昏头昏脑的，都忘记请我喝点茶了。但是我们都是这么这么高兴，是不是？回到罗克维罗天已经黑了——但是，哦，天上的星星多么明亮！今天早上，我和科林去了咱们俩曾一起去过的所有地方，回想你曾说过的每一句话，以及你当时的样子。今天的树林宛如闪亮的青铜，空气清冽，是爬山的好天气。我盼着你来和我一起爬山。我非常非常想你，亲爱的杰维，这是种喜悦的想念。我们很快会在一起的。现在我们真的相互拥有了，真实、真正地拥有，而非虚幻。最后，我终于有了归宿，听起来是不是很奇怪？但真的非常、非常甜蜜。

我不会让你有片刻后悔和遗憾的。

你永远的

茱迪

星期四早晨

“Blue Wednesday”


The first Wednesday in every month was a Perfectly Awful Day—a day to be awaited with dread, endured with courage, and forgotten with haste. Every floor must be spotless, every chair dustless, and every bed without a wrinkle. Ninety-seven squirming little orphans must be scrubbed and combed and buttoned into freshly starched ginghams; and all ninety-seven reminded of their manners, and told to say “Yes, sir,” “No, sir,” whenever a Trustee spoke.

It was a distressing time; and poor Jerusha Abbott, being the oldest orphan, had to bear the brunt of it. But this particular first Wednesday, like its predecessors, finally dragged itself to a close. Jerusha escaped from the pantry where she had been making sandwiches for the asylum's guests, and turned upstairs to accomplish her regular work. Her special care was room F, where eleven little tots, from four to seven, occupied eleven little cots set in a row. Jerusha assembled her charges, straightened their rumpled frocks, wiped their noses, and started them in an orderly and willing line toward the dining room to engage themselves for a blessed half hour with bread and milk and prune pudding.

Then she dropped down on the window seat and leaned throbbing temples against the cool glass. She had been on her feet since five that morning doing everybody's bidding, scolded and hurried by a nervous matron. Mrs. Lippett, behind the scenes, did not always maintain that calm and pompous dignity with which she faced an audience of Trustees and lady visitors. Jerusha gazed out across a broad stretch of frozen lawn, beyond the tall iron paling that marked the confines of the asylum, down undulating ridges sprinkled with country estates, to the spires of the village rising from the midst of bare trees.

The day was ended—quite successfully, so far as she knew. The Trustees and the visiting committee had made their rounds, and read their reports, and drunk their tea, and now were hurrying home to their own cheerful firesides, to forget their bothersome little charges for another month. Jerusha leaned forward watching with curiosity—and a touch of wistfulness—the stream of carriages and automobiles that rolled out of the asylum gates. In imagination she followed first one equipage then another to the big houses dotted along the hillside. She pictured herself in a fur coat and a velvet hat trimmed with feathers leaning back in the seat and nonchalantly murmuring “Home” to the driver. But on the doorsill of her home the picture grew blurred.

Jerusha had an imagination—an imagination, Mrs. Lippett told her, that would get her into trouble if she didn't take care—but keen as it was, it could not carry her beyond the front porch of the houses she would enter. Poor, eager, adventurous little Jerusha, in all her seventeen years, had never stepped inside an ordinary house; she could not picture the daily routine of those other human beings who carried on their lives undiscommoded by orphans.

Je-ru-sha Ab-bott

You are wan-ted

In the of-fice,

And I think you'd

Better hurry up!

Tommy Dillon who had joined the choir, came singing up the stairs and down the corridor, his chant growing louder as he approached room F. Jerusha wrenched herself from the window and refaced the troubles of life.

“Who wants me?” she cut into Tommy's chant with a note of sharp anxiety.

Mrs. Lippett in the office,

And I think she's mad.

Ah-a-men!

Tommy piously intoned, but his accent was not entirely malicious. Even the most hardened little orphan felt sympathy for an erring sister who was summoned to the office to face an annoyed matron; and Tommy liked Jerusha even if she did sometimes jerk him by the arm and nearly scrub his nose off.

Jerusha went without comment, but with two parallel lines on her brow. What could have gone wrong? she wondered. Were the sandwiches not thin enough? Were there shells in the nut cakes? Had a lady visitor seen the hole in Susie Hawthorn's stocking? Had—O horrors!—one of the cherubic little babes in her own room F “sassed” a Trustee?

The long lower hall had not been lighted, and as she came downstairs, a last Trustee stood, on the point of departure, in the open door that led to the porte-cochère. Jerusha caught only a fleeting impression of the man—and the impression consisted entirely of tallness. He was waving his arm toward an automobile waiting in the curved drive. As it sprang into motion and approached, head on for an instant, the glaring headlights threw his shadow sharply against the wall inside. The shadow pictured grotesquely elongated legs and arms that ran along the floor and up the wall of the corridor. It looked, for all the world, like a huge, wavering daddy-long-legs.

Jerusha's anxious frown gave place to quick laughter. She was by nature a sunny soul, and had always snatched the tiniest excuse to be amused. If one could derive any sort of entertainment out of the oppressive fact of a Trustee, it was something unexpected to the good. She advanced to the office quite cheered by the tiny episode, and presented a smiling face to Mrs. Lippett. To her surprise the matron was also, if not exactly smiling, at least appreciably affable; she wore an expression almost as pleasant as the one she donned for visitors.

“Sit down, Jerusha, I have something to say to you.”

Jerusha dropped into the nearest chair and waited with a touch of breathlessness. An automobile flashed past the window; Mrs. Lippett glanced after it.

“Did you notice the gentleman who has just gone?”

“I saw his back.”

“He is one of our most affluential Trustees, and has given large sums of money toward the asylum's support. I am not at liberty to mention his name; he expressly stipulated that he was to remain unknown.”

Jerusha's eyes widened slightly; she was not accustomed to being summoned to the office to discuss the eccentricities of Trustees with the matron.

“This gentleman has taken an interest in several of our boys. You remember Charles Benton and Henry Freize? They were both sent through college by Mr.—er—this Trustee, and both have repaid with hard work and success the money that was so generously expended. Other payment the gentleman does not wish. Heretofore his philanthropies have been directed solely toward the boys; I have never been able to interest him in the slightest degree in any of the girls in the institution, no matter how deserving. He does not, I may tell you, care for girls.”

“No, ma'am,” Jerusha murmured, since some reply seemed to be expected at this point.

“Today at the regular meeting, the question of your future was brought up.”

Mrs. Lippett allowed a moment of silence to fall, then resumed in a slow, placid manner extremely trying to her hearer's suddenly tightened nerves.

“Usually, as you know, the children are not kept after they are sixteen, but an exception was made in your case. You had finished our school at fourteen, and having done so well in your studies—not always, I must say, in your conduct—it was determined to let you go on in the village high school. Now you are finishing that, and of course the asylum cannot be responsible any longer for your support. As it is, you have had two years more than most.”

Mrs. Lippett overlooked the fact that Jerusha had worked hard for her board during those two years, that the convenience of the asylum had come first and her education second; that on days like the present she was kept at home to scrub.

“As I say, the question of your future was brought up and your record was discussed—thoroughly discussed.”

Mrs. Lippett brought accusing eyes to bear upon the prisoner in the dock, and the prisoner looked guilty because it seemed to be expected—not because she could remember any strikingly black pages in her record.

“Of course the usual disposition of one in your place would be to put you in a position where you could begin to work, but you have done well in school in certain branches; it seems that your work in English has even been brilliant. Miss Pritchard, who is on our visiting committee, is also on the school board; she has been talking with your rhetoric teacher, and made a speech in your favor. She also read aloud an essay that you had written entitled, Blue Wednesday.”

Jerusha's guilty expression this time was not assumed.

“It seemed to me that you showed little gratitude in holding up to ridicule the institution that has done so much for you. Had you not managed to be funny I doubt if you would have been forgiven. But fortunately for you, Mr. ——, that is, the gentleman who has just gone—appears to have an immoderate sense of humor. On the strength of that impertinent paper, he has offered to send you to college.”

“To college?” Jerusha's eyes grew big.

Mrs. Lippett nodded.

“He waited to discuss the terms with me. They are unusual. The gentleman, I may say, is erratic. He believes that you have originality, and he is planning to educate you to become a writer.”

“A writer?” Jerusha's mind was numbed. She could only repeat Mrs. Lippett's words.

“That is his wish. Whether anything will come of it, the future will show. He is giving you a very liberal allowance, almost, for a girl who has never had any experience in taking care of money, too liberal. But he planned the matter in detail, and I did not feel free to make any suggestions. You are to remain here through the summer, and Miss Pritchard has kindly offered to superintend your outfit. Your board and tuition will be paid directly to the college, and you will receive in addition during the four years you are there, an allowance of thirty-five dollars a month. This will enable you to enter on the same standing as the other students. The money will be sent to you by the gentleman's private secretary once a month, and in return, you will write a letter of acknowledgment once a month. That is—you are not to thank him for the money; he doesn't care to have that mentioned, but you are to write a letter telling of the progress in your studies and the details of your daily life. Just such a letter as you would write to your parents if they were living.

“These letters will be addressed to Mr. John Smith and will be sent in care of the secretary. The gentleman's name is not John Smith, but he prefers to remain unknown. To you he will never be anything but John Smith. His reason in requiring the letters is that he thinks nothing so fosters facility in literary expression as letter writing. Since you have no family with whom to correspond, he desires you to write in this way; also, he wishes to keep track of your progress. He will never answer your letters, nor in the slightest particular take any notice of them. He detests letter writing, and does not wish you to become a burden. If any point should ever arise where an answer would seem to be imperative—such as in the event of your being expelled, which I trust will not occur—you may correspond with Mr. Griggs, his secretary. These monthly letters are absolutely obligatory on your part; they are the only payment that Mr. Smith requires, so you must be as punctilious in sending them as though it were a bill that you were paying. I hope that they will always be respectful in tone and will reflect credit on your training. You must remember that you are writing to a Trustee of the John Grier Home.”

Jerusha's eyes longingly sought the door. Her head was in a whirl of excitement, and she wished only to escape from Mrs. Lippett's platitudes, and think. She rose and took a tentative step backwards. Mrs. Lippett detained her with a gesture; it was an oratorical opportunity not to be slighted.

“I trust that you are properly grateful for this very rare good fortune that has befallen you? Not many girls in your position ever have such an opportunity to rise in the world. You must always remember—”

“I—yes, ma'am, thank you. I think, if that's all, I must go and sew a patch on Freddie Perkins's trousers.”

The door closed behind her, and Mrs. Lippett watched it with dropped jaw, her peroration in midair.





The Letters of Miss Jerusha Abbott to Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs Smith


215 Fergussen Hall,

September 24th

Dear Kind-trustee-Who-sends-orphans-to-College,

Here I am! I traveled yesterday for four hours in a train. It's a funny sensation, isn't it? I never rode in one before.

College is the biggest, most bewildering place—I get lost whenever I leave my room. I will write you a description later when I'm feeling less muddled; also I will tell you about my lessons. Classes don't begin until Monday morning, and this is Saturday night. But I wanted to write a letter first just to get acquainted.

It seems queer to be writing letters to somebody you don't know. It seems queer for me to be writing letters at all—I've never written more than three or four in my life, so please overlook it if these are not a model kind.

Before leaving yesterday morning, Mrs. Lippett and I had a very serious talk. She told me how to behave all the rest of my life, and especially how to behave toward the kind gentleman who is doing so much for me. I must take care to be Very Respectful.

But how can one be very respectful to a person who wishes to be called John Smith? Why couldn't you have picked out a name with a little personality? I might as well write letters to Dear Hitching-Post or Dear Clothes-Pole.

I have been thinking about you a great deal this summer; having somebody take an interest in me after all these years, makes me feel as though I had found a sort of family. It seems as though I belonged to somebody now, and it's a very comfortable sensation. I must say, however, that when I think about you, my imagination has very little to work upon. There are just three things that I know：

Ⅰ. You are tall.

Ⅱ. You are rich.

Ⅲ. You hate girls.

I suppose I might call you Dear Mr. Girl-Hater. Only that's sort of insulting to me. Or Dear Mr. Rich-Man, but that's insulting to you, as though money were the only important thing about you. Besides, being rich is such a very external quality. Maybe you won't stay rich all your life; lots of very clever men get smashed up in Wall Street. But at least you will stay tall all your life! So I've decided to call you Dear Daddy-Long-Legs. I hope you won't mind. It's just a private pet name—we won't tell Mrs. Lippett.

The ten o'clock bell is going to ring in two minutes. Our day is divided into sections by bells. We eat and sleep and study by bells. It's very enlivening; I feel like a firehorse all of the time. There it goes! Lights out. Good night.

Observe with what precision I obey rules—due to my training in the John Grier Home.

Yours most respectfully,

Jerusha Abbott





October 1st

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I love college and I love you for sending me—I'm very, very happy, and so excited every moment of the time that I can scarcely sleep. You can't imagine how different it is from the John Grier Home. I never dreamed there was such a place in the world. I'm feeling sorry for everybody who isn't a girl and who can't come here; I am sure the college you attended when you were a boy couldn't have been so nice.

My room is up in a tower that used to be the contagious ward before they built the new infirmary. There are three other girls on the same floor of the tower—a senior who wears spectacles and is always asking us please to be a little more quiet, and two freshmen named Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton. Sallie has red hair and a turn-up nose and is quite friendly; Julia comes from one of the first families in New York and hasn't noticed me yet. They room together and the senior and I have singles. Usually Freshmen can't get singles; they are very scarce, but I got one without even asking. I suppose the registrar didn't think it would be right to ask a properly brought-up girl to room with a foundling. You see there are advantages!

My room is on the northwest corner with two windows and a view. After you've lived in a ward for eighteen years with twenty roommates, it is restful to be alone. This is the first chance I've ever had to get acquainted with Jerusha Abbott. I think I'm going to like her.

Do you think you are?





Tuesday

They are organizing the freshman basketball team and there's just a chance that I shall make it. I'm little of course, but terribly quick and wiry and tough. While the others are hopping about in the air, I can dodge under their feet and grab the ball. It's loads of fun practising—out in the athletic field in the afternoon with the trees all red and yellow and the air full of the smell of burning leaves, and everybody laughing and shouting. These are the happiest girls I ever saw—and I am the happiest of all!

I meant to write a long letter and tell you all the things I'm learning (Mrs. Lippett said you wanted to know) but 7th hour has just rung, and in ten minutes I'm due at the athletic field in gymnasium clothes. Don't you hope I'll make the team?

Yours always,

Jerusha Abbott.

P. S. (9 o'clock)

Sallie McBride just poked her head in at my door. This is what she said：

“I'm so homesick that I simply can't stand it. Do you feel that way?”

I smiled a little and said no, I thought I could pull through. At least homesickness is one disease that I've escaped! I never heard of anybody being asylumsick, did you?





October 10th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Did you ever hear of Michelangelo?

He was a famous artist who lived in Italy in the Middle Ages. Everybody in English Literature seemed to know about him and the whole class laughed because I thought he was an archangel. He sounds like an archangel, doesn't he? The trouble with college is that you are expected to know such a lot of things you've never learned. It's very embarrassing at times. But now, when the girls talk about things that I never heard of, I just keep still and look them up in the encyclopedia.

I made an awful mistake the first day. Somebody mentioned Maurice Maeterlinck, and I asked if she was a freshman. That joke has gone all over college. But anyway, I'm just as bright in class as any of the others—and brighter than some of them!

Do you care to know how I've furnished my room? It's a symphony in brown and yellow. The wall was tinted buff, and I've bought yellow denim curtains and cushions and a mahogany desk (second hand for three dollars) and a rattan chair and a brown rug with an ink spot in the middle. I stand the chair over the spot.

The windows are up high; you can't look out from an ordinary seat. But I unscrewed the looking glass from the back of the bureau, upholstered the top, and moved it up against the window. It's just the right height for a window seat. You pull out the drawers like steps and walk up. Very comfortable!

Sallie McBride helped me choose the things at the senior auction. She has lived in a house all her life and knows about furnishing. You can't imagine what fun it is to shop and pay with a real five-dollar bill and get some change—when you've never had more than a nickel in your life. I assure you, Daddy dear, I do appreciate that allowance.

Sallie is the most entertaining person in the world—and Julia Rutledge Pendleton the least so.

It's queer what a mixture the registrar can make in the matter of roommates. Sallie thinks everything is funny—even flunking—and Julia is bored at everything. She never makes the slightest effort to be amiable. She believes that if you are a Pendleton, that fact alone admits you to heaven without any further examination. Julia and I were born to be enemies.

And now I suppose you've been waiting very impatiently to hear what I am learning?

Ⅰ. Latin：Second Punic War. Hannibal and his forces pitched camp at Lake Trasimenus last night. They prepared an ambuscade for the Romans, and a battle took place at the fourth watch this morning. Romans in retreat.

Ⅱ. French：24 pages of the Three Musketeers and third conjugation, irregular verbs.

Ⅲ. Geometry：Finished cylinders; now doing cones.

Ⅳ. English：Studying exposition. My style improves daily in clearness and brevity.

Ⅴ. Physiology：Reached the digestive system. Bile and the pancreas next time.

Yours, on the way to being educated,

Jerusha Abbott

P. S. I hope you never touch alcohol, Daddy? It does dreadful things to your liver.





Wednesday

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I've changed my name.

I'm still “Jerusha” in the catalogue, but I'm “Judy” everyplace else. It's sort of too bad, isn't it, to have to give yourself the only pet name you ever had? I didn't quite make up the Judy though. That's what Freddie Perkins used to call me before he could talk plain.

I wish Mrs. Lippett would use a little more ingenuity about choosing babies' names. She gets the last names out of the telephone book—you'll find Abbott on the first page—and she picks the Christian names up anywhere; she got Jerusha from a tombstone. I've always hated it; but I rather like Judy. It's such a silly name. It belongs to the kind of girl I'm not—a sweet little blue-eyed thing, petted and spoiled by all the family, who romps her way through life without any cares. Wouldn't it be nice to be like that? Whatever faults I may have, no one can ever accuse me of having been spoiled by my family! But it's sort of fun to pretend I've been. In the future please always address me as Judy.

Do you want to know something? I have three pairs of kid gloves. I've had kid mittens before from the Christmas tree, but never real kid gloves with five fingers. I take them out and try them on every little while. It's all I can do not to wear them to classes.

(Dinner bell. Good-bye.)





Friday

What do you think, Daddy? The English instructor said that my last paper shows an unusual amount of originality. She did, truly. Those were her words. It doesn't seem possible, does it, considering the eighteen years of training that I've had? The aim of the John Grier Home (as you doubtless know and heartily approve of) is to turn the ninety-seven orphans into ninety-seven twins.

ANY ORPHAN



The unusual artistic ability which I exhibit, was developed at an early age through drawing chalk pictures of Mrs. Lippett on the woodshed door.

I hope that I don't hurt your feelings when I criticize the home of my youth? But you have the upper hand, you know, for if I become too impertinent, you can always stop payment on your checks. That isn't a very polite thing to say—but you can't expect me to have any manners; a foundling asylum isn't a young ladies' finishing school.

You know, Daddy, it isn't the work that is going to be hard in college. It's the play. Half the time I don't know what the girls are talking about; their jokes seem to relate to a past that every one but me has shared. I'm a foreigner in the world and I don't understand the language. It's a miserable feeling. I've had it all my life. At the high school the girls would stand in groups and just look at me. I was queer and different and everybody knew it. I could feel “John Grier Home” written on my face. And then a few charitable ones would make a point of coming up and saying something polite. I hated every one of them—the charitable ones most of all.

Nobody here knows that I was brought up in an asylum. I told Sallie McBride that my mother and father were dead, and that a kind old gentleman was sending me to college—which is entirely true so far as it goes. I don't want you to think I am a coward, but I do want to be like the other girls, and that Dreadful Home looming over my childhood is the one great big difference. If I can turn my back on that and shut out the remembrance, I think I might be just as desirable as any other girl. I don't believe there's any real, underneath difference, do you?

Anyway, Sallie McBride likes me!

Yours ever,

Judy Abbott

(Née Jerusha.)





Saturday morning

I've just been reading this letter over and it sounds pretty un-cheerful. But can't you guess that I have a special topic due Monday morning and a review in geometry and a very sneezy cold?

Sunday

I forgot to mail this yesterday so I will add an indignant postscript. We had a bishop this morning, and what do you think he said?

“The most beneficent promise made us in the Bible is this,‘The poor ye have always with you.’ They were put here in order to keep us charitable.”

The poor, please observe, being a sort of useful domestic animal. If I hadn't grown into such a perfect lady, I should have gone up after service and told him what I thought.





October 25th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I've made the basketball team and you ought to see the bruise on my left shoulder. It's blue and mahogany with little streaks of orange. Julia Pendleton tried for the team, but she didn't make it. Hooray!

You see what a mean disposition I have.

Judy at Basket Ball



College gets nicer and nicer. I like the girls and the teachers and the classes and the campus and the things to eat. We have ice cream twice a week and we never have corn-meal mush.

You only wanted to hear from me once a month, didn't you? And I've been peppering you with letters every few days! But I've been so excited about all these new adventures that I must talk to somebody; and you're the only one I know. Please excuse my exuberance; I'll settle pretty soon. If my letters bore you, you can always toss them into the wastebasket. I promise not to write another till the middle of November.

Yours most loquaciously,

Judy Abbott





November 15th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Listen to what I've learned today：

The area of the convex surface of the frustum of a regular pyramid is half the product of the sum of the perimeters of its bases by the altitude of either of its trapezoids.

It doesn't sound true, but it is—I can prove it!

You've never heard about my clothes, have you, Daddy? Six dresses, all new and beautiful and bought for me—not handed down from somebody bigger. Perhaps you don't realize what a climax that marks in the career of an orphan? You gave them to me, and I am very, very, very much obliged. It's a fine thing to be educated—but nothing compared to the dizzying experience of owning six new dresses. Miss Pritchard, who is on the visiting committee, picked them out—not Mrs. Lippett, thank goodness. I have an evening dress, pink mull over silk (I'm perfectly beautiful in that), and a blue church dress, and a dinner dress of red veiling with Oriental trimming (makes me look like a Gipsy) and another of rose-colored challis, and a gray street suit, and an everyday dress for classes. That wouldn't be an awfully big wardrobe for Julia Rutledge Pendleton, perhaps, but for Jerusha Abbott—Oh, my!

I suppose you're thinking now what a frivolous, shallow, little beast she is, and what a waste of money to educate a girl?

But, Daddy, if you'd been dressed in checked ginghams all your life, you'd appreciate how I feel. And when I started to the high school, I entered upon another period even worse than the checked ginghams.

The poor box.

You can't know how I dreaded appearing in school in those miserable poor-box dresses. I was perfectly sure to be put down in class next to the girl who first owned my dress, and she would whisper and giggle and point it out to the others. The bitterness of wearing your enemies' cast-off clothes eats into your soul. If I wore silk stockings for the rest of my life, I don't believe I could obliterate the scar.

LATEST WAR BULLETIN!

News from the Scene of Action.

At the fourth watch on Thursday the 13th of November, Hannibal routed the advance guard of the Romans and led the Carthaginian forces over the mountains into the plains of Casilinum. A cohort of light armed Numidians engaged the infantry of Quintus Fabius Maximus. Two battles and light skirmishing. Romans repulsed with heavy losses.

I have the honor of being,

Your special correspondent from the front,

J. Abbott

P. S. I know I'm not to expect any letters in return, and I've been warned not to bother you with questions, but tell me, Daddy, just this once—are you awfully old or just a little old? And are you perfectly bald or just a little bald? It is very difficult thinking about you in the abstract like a theorem in geometry.

Given a tall rich man who hates girls, but is very generous to one quite impertinent girl, what does he look like?

R. S. V. P.





December 19th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

You never answered my question and it was very important.

ARE YOU BALD?

I have it planned exactly what you look like—very satisfactorily—until I reach the top of your head, and then I am stuck. I can't decide whether you have white hair or black hair or sort of sprinkly gray hair or maybe none at all.

Here is your portrait：



But the problem is, shall I add some hair?

Would you like to know what color your eyes are? They're gray, and your eyebrows stick out like a porch roof (beetling, they're called in novels) and your mouth is a straight line with a tendency to turn down at the corners. Oh, you see, I know! You're a snappy old thing with a temper.

(Chapel bell.)

9.45 P. M.

I have a new unbreakable rule：never, never to study at night no matter how many written reviews are coming in the morning. Instead, I read just plain books—I have to, you know, because there are eighteen blank years behind me. You wouldn't believe, Daddy, what an abyss of ignorance my mind is; I am just realizing the depths myself. The things that most girls with a properly assorted family and a home and friends and a library know by absorption, I have never heard of. For example：

I never read Mother Goose or David Copperfield or Ivanhoe or Cinderella or Blue Beard or Robinson Crusoe or Jane Eyre or Alice in Wonderland or a word of Rudyard Kipling. I didn't know that Henry the Eighth was married more than once or that Shelley was a poet. I didn't know that people used to be monkeys and that the Garden of Eden was a beautiful myth. I didn't know that R. L. S. stood for Robert Louis Stevenson or that George Eliot was a lady. I had never seen a picture of the “Mona Lisa” and (it's true but you won't believe it) I had never heard of Sherlock Holmes.

Now, I know all of these things and a lot of others besides, but you can see how much I need to catch up. And oh, but it's fun! I look forward all day to evening, and then I put an “engaged” on the door and get into my nice red bathrobe and furry slippers and pile all the cushions behind me on the couch and light the brass student lamp at my elbow, and read and read and read. One book isn't enough. I have four going at once. Just now, they're Tennyson's poems and Vanity Fair and Kipling's Plain Tales and—don't laugh—Little Women. I find that I am the only girl in college who wasn't brought up on Little Women. I haven't told anybody though (that would stamp me as queer). I just quietly went and bought it with $1.12 of my last month's allowance; and the next time somebody mentions pickled limes, I'll know what she is talking about!

(Ten o'clock bell. This is a very interrupted letter.)





Saturday

Sir,

I have the honor to report fresh explorations in the field of geometry. On Friday last we abandoned our former works in parallelopipeds and proceeded to truncated prisms. We are finding the road rough and very uphill.





Sunday

The Christmas holidays begin next week and the trunks are up. The corridors are so cluttered that you can hardly get through, and everybody is so bubbling over with excitement that studying is getting left out. I'm going to have a beautiful time in vacation; there's another freshman who lives in Texas staying behind, and we are planning to take long walks and—if there's any ice—learn to skate. Then there is still the whole library to be read—and three empty weeks to do it in!

Good-bye, Daddy, I hope that you are feeling as happy as I am.

Yours ever,

Judy

P. S. Don't forget to answer my question. If you don't want the trouble of writing, have your secretary telegraph. He can just say：

Mr. Smith is quite bald,

or

Mr. Smith is not bald,

or

Mr. Smith has white hair.

And you can deduct the twenty-five cents out of my allowance. Good-bye till January—and a merry Christmas!





Toward the end of the Christmas vacation.

Exact date unknown.

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Is it snowing where you are? All the world that I see from my tower is draped in white and the flakes are coming down as big as popcorn. It's late afternoon—the sun is just setting (a cold yellow color) behind some colder violet hills, and I am up in my window seat using the last light to write to you.

Your five gold pieces were a surprise! I'm not used to receiving Christmas presents. You have already given me such lots of things—everything I have, you know—that I don't quite feel that I deserve extras. But I like them just the same. Do you want to know what I bought with my money?

Ⅰ. A silver watch in a leather case to wear on my wrist and get me to recitations on time.

Ⅱ. Matthew Arnold's poems.

Ⅲ. A hot water bottle.

Ⅳ. A steamer rug. (My tower is cold.)

Ⅴ. Five hundred sheets of yellow manuscript paper. (I'm going to commence being an author pretty soon.)

Ⅵ. A dictionary of synonyms. (To enlarge the author's vocabulary.)

Ⅶ. (I don't much like to confess this last item, but I will.) A pair of silk stockings.

And now, Daddy, never say I don't tell all!

It was a very low motive, if you must know it, that prompted the silk stockings. Julia Pendleton comes into my room to do geometry, and she sits cross-legged on the couch and wears silk stockings every night. But just wait—as soon as she gets back from vacation I shall go in and sit on her couch in my silk stockings. You see, Daddy, the miserable creature that I am—but at least I'm honest; and you knew already, from my asylum record, that I wasn't perfect, didn't you?

To recapitulate (that's the way the English instructor begins every other sentence), I am very much obliged for my seven presents. I'm pretending to myself that they came in a box from my family in California. The watch is from father, the lap rug from mother, the hot water bottle from grandmother—who is always worrying for fear I shall catch cold in this climate—and the yellow paper from my little brother Harry. My sister Isobel gave me the silk stockings, and Aunt Susan the Matthew Arnold poems; Uncle Harry (little Harry is named for him) gave me the dictionary. He wanted to send chocolates, but I insisted on synonyms.

You don't object do you, to playing the part of a composite family?

And now, shall I tell you about my vacation, or are you only interested in my education as such? I hope you appreciate the delicate shade of meaning in “as such.” It is the latest addition to my vocabulary.

The girl from Texas is named Leonora Fenton. (Almost as funny as Jerusha, isn't it?) I like her, but not so much as Sallie McBride; I shall never like any one so much as Sallie—except you. I must always like you the best of all, because you're my whole family rolled into one. Leonora and I and two sophomores have walked 'cross country every pleasant day and explored the whole neighborhood, dressed in short skirts and knit jackets and caps, and carrying hockey sticks to whack things with. Once we walked into town—four miles—and stopped at a restaurant where the college girls go for dinner. Broiled lobster (35 cents) and for dessert, buckwheat cakes and maple syrup (15 cents). Nourishing and cheap.

It was such a lark! Especially for me, because it was so awfully different from the asylum—I feel like an escaped convict every time I leave the campus. Before I thought, I started to tell the others what an experience I was having. The cat was almost out of the bag when I grabbed it by its tail and pulled it back. It's awfully hard for me not to tell everything I know. I'm a very confiding soul by nature; if I didn't have you to tell things to, I'd burst.

We had a molasses candy pull last Friday evening, given by the house matron of Fergussen to the left-behinds in the other halls. There were twenty-two of us altogether, freshmen and sophomores and juniors and seniors all united in amicable accord. The kitchen is huge, with copper pots and kettles hanging in rows on the stone wall—the littlest casserole among them about the size of a washboiler. Four hundred girls live in Fergussen. The chef, in a white cap and apron, fetched out twenty-two other white caps and aprons—I can't imagine where he got so many—and we all turned ourselves into cooks.

It was great fun, though I have seen better candy. When it was finally finished, and ourselves and the kitchen and the doorknobs all thoroughly sticky, we organized a procession and still in our caps and aprons, each carrying a big fork or spoon or frying pan, we marched through the empty corridors to the officers' parlor where half a dozen professors and instructors were passing a tranquil evening. We serenaded them with college songs and offered refreshments. They accepted politely but dubiously. We left them sucking chunks of molasses candy, sticky and speechless.

So you see, Daddy, my education progresses!



Don't you really think that I ought to be an artist instead of an author?

Vacation will be over in two days and I shall be glad to see the girls again. My tower is just a trifle lonely; when nine people occupy a house that was built for four hundred, they do rattle around a bit.

Eleven pages—poor Daddy, you must be tired! I meant this to be just a short little thank-you note—but when I get started I seem to have a ready pen.

Good-bye, and thank you for thinking of me—I should be perfectly happy except for one little threatening cloud on the horizon. Examinations come in February.

Yours with love,

Judy

P. S. Maybe it isn't proper to send love? If it isn't, please excuse. But I must love somebody and there's only you and Mrs. Lippett to choose between, so you see—you'll have to put up with it, Daddy dear, because I can't love her.





On the Eve

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

You should see the way this college is studying! We've forgotten we ever had a vacation. Fifty-seven irregular verbs have I introduced to my brain in the past four days—I'm only hoping they'll stay till after examinations.

Some of the girls sell their textbooks when they're through with them, but I intend to keep mine. Then after I've graduated I shall have my whole education in a row in the bookcase, and when I need to use any detail, I can turn to it without the slightest hesitation. So much easier and more accurate than trying to keep it in your head.

Julia Pendleton dropped in this evening to pay a social call, and stayed a solid hour. She got started on the subject of family, and I couldn't switch her off. She wanted to know what my mother's maiden name was—did you ever hear such an impertinent question to ask of a person from a foundling asylum? I didn't have the courage to say I didn't know, so I just miserably plumped on the first name I could think of, and that was Montgomery. Then she wanted to know whether I belonged to the Massachusetts Montgomerys or the Virginia Montgomerys.

Her mother was a Rutherford. The family came over in the ark, and were connected by marriage with Henry the Eighth. On her father's side they date back further than Adam. On the topmost branches of her family tree there's a superior breed of monkeys, with very fine silky hair and extra long tails.

I meant to write you a nice, cheerful, entertaining letter tonight, but I'm too sleepy—and scared. The Freshman's lot is not a happy one.

Yours, about to be examined,

Judy Abbott





Sunday

Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,

I have some awful, awful, awful news to tell you, but I won't begin with it; I'll try to get you in a good humor first.

Jerusha Abbott has commenced to be an author. A poem entitled, “From my Tower,” appears in the February Monthly—on the first page, which is a very great honor for a Freshman. My English instructor stopped me on the way out from chapel last night, and said it was a charming piece of work except for the sixth line, which had too many feet. I will send you a copy in case you care to read it.

Let me see if I can't think of something else pleasant—oh, yes! I'm learning to skate, and can glide about quite respectably all by myself. Also I've learned how to slide down a rope from the roof of the gymnasium, and I can vault a bar three feet and six inches high—I hope shortly to pull up to four feet.

We had a very inspiring sermon this morning preached by the Bishop of Alabama. His text was：“Judge not that ye be not judged.” It was about the necessity of overlooking mistakes in others, and not discouraging people by harsh judgments. I wish you might have heard it.

This is the sunniest, most blinding winter afternoon, with icicles dripping from the fir trees and all the world bending under a weight of snow—except me, and I'm bending under a weight of sorrow.

Now for the news—courage, Judy!—you must tell.

Are you surely in a good humor? I flunked mathematics and Latin prose. I am tutoring in them, and will take another examination next month. I'm sorry if you're disappointed, but otherwise I don't care a bit because I've learned such a lot of things not mentioned in the catalogue. I've read seventeen novels and bushels of poetry—really necessary novels like Vanity Fair and Richard Feverel and Alice in Wonderland. Also Emerson's Essays and Lockhart's Life of Scott and the first volume of Gibbon's Roman Empire and half of Benvenuto Cellini's Life—wasn't he entertaining? He used to saunter out and casually kill a man before breakfast.

So you see, Daddy, I'm much more intelligent than if I'd just stuck to Latin. Will you forgive me this once if I promise never to flunk again?

Yours in sackcloth,

Judy

NEWS of the MONTH





Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

This is an extra letter in the middle of the month because I'm sort of lonely tonight. It's awfully stormy; the snow is beating against my tower. All the lights are out on the campus, but I drank black coffee and I can't go to sleep.

I had a supper party this evening consisting of Sallie and Julia and Leonora Fenton—and sardines and toasted muffins and salad and fudge and coffee. Julia said she'd had a good time, but Sallie stayed to help wash the dishes.

I might, very usefully, put some time on Latin tonight—but, there's no doubt about it, I'm a very languid Latin scholar. We've finished Livy and De Senectute and are now engaged with De Amicitia (pronounced Damn Icitia).

Should you mind, just for a little while, pretending you are my grandmother? Sallie has one and Julia and Leonora each two, and they were all comparing them tonight. I can't think of anything I'd rather have, it's such a respectable relationship. So, if you really don't object—when I went into town yesterday, I saw the sweetest cap of Cluny lace trimmed with lavender ribbon. I am going to make you a present of it on your eighty-third birthday.




That's the clock in the chapel tower striking twelve. I believe I am sleepy after all.

Good night, Granny.

I love you dearly.

Judy





The Ides of March

Dear D. L. L.,

I am studying Latin prose composition. I have been studying it. I shall be studying it. I shall be about to have been studying it. My reexamination comes the 7th hour next Tuesday, and I am going to pass or BUST. So you may expect to hear from me next, whole and happy and free from conditions, or in fragments.

I will write a respectable letter when it's over. Tonight I have a pressing engagement with the Ablative Absolute.

Yours—in evident haste,

J. A.





March 26th

Mr. D. L. L. smith,

Sir：You never answer any questions; you never show the slightest interest in anything I do. You are probably the horridest one of all those horrid Trustees, and the reason you are educating me is, not because you care a bit about me, but from a sense of duty.

I don't know a single thing about you. I don't even know your name. It is very uninspiring writing to a thing. I haven't a doubt but that you throw my letters into the wastebasket without reading them. Hereafter I shall write only about work.

My reexaminations in Latin and geometry came last week. I passed them both and am now free from conditions.

Yours truly,

Jerusha Abbott





April 2nd

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I am a BEAST.

Please forget about that dreadful letter I sent you last week—I was feeling terribly lonely and miserable and sore-throaty the night I wrote. I didn't know it, but I was just coming down with tonsillitis and grippe and lots of things mixed. I'm in the infirmary now, and have been here for six days; this is the first time they would let me sit up and have a pen and paper. The head nurse is very bossy. But I've been thinking about it all the time and I shan't get well until you forgive me.

Here is a picture of the way I look, with a bandage tied around my head in rabbit's ears.



Doesn't that arouse your sympathy? I am having sublingual gland swelling. And I've been studying physiology all the year without ever hearing of sublingual glands. How futile a thing is education!

I can't write any more; I get sort of shaky when I sit up too long. Please forgive me for being impertinent and ungrateful. I was badly brought up.

Yours with love,

Judy Abbott





The Infirmary

April 4th

Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,

Yesterday evening just toward dark, when I was sitting up in bed looking out at the rain and feeling awfully bored with life in a great institution, the nurse appeared with a long white box addressed to me, and filled with the loveliest pink rosebuds. And much nicer still, it contained a card with a very polite message written in a funny little uphill back hand (but one which shows a great deal of character). Thank you, Daddy, a thousand times. Your flowers make the first real, true present I ever received in my life. If you want to know what a baby I am, I lay down and cried because I was so happy.

Now that I am sure you read my letters, I'll make them much more interesting, so they'll be worth keeping in a safe with red tape around them—only please take out that dreadful one and burn it up. I'd hate to think that you ever read it over.

Thank you for making a very sick, cross, miserable freshman cheerful. Probably you have lots of loving family and friends, and you don't know what it feels like to be alone. But I do.

Good-bye—I'll promise never to be horrid again, because now I know you're a real person; also I'll promise never to bother you with any more questions.

Do you still hate girls?

Yours forever,

Judy





8th hour, Monday

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I hope you aren't the Trustee who sat on the toad? It went off—I was told—with quite a pop, so probably he was a fatter Trustee.

Do you remember the little dugout places with gratings over them by the laundry windows in the John Grier Home? Every spring when the hoptoad season opened we used to form a collection of toads and keep them in those window holes; and occasionally they would spill over into the laundry, causing a very pleasurable commotion on wash days. We were severely punished for our activities in this direction, but in spite of all discouragement the toads would collect.

And one day—well, I won't bore you with particulars—but somehow, one of the fattest, biggest, juiciest toads got into one of those big leather arm chairs in the Trustees' room, and that afternoon at the Trustees' meeting.... But I dare say you were there and recall the rest?

Looking back dispassionately after a period of time, I will say that punishment was merited, and—if I remember rightly—adequate.

I don't know why I am in such a reminiscent mood except that spring and the reappearance of toads always awakens the old acquisitive instinct. The only thing that keeps me from starting a collection is the fact that no rule exists against it.





After chapel, Thursday

What do you think is my favorite book? Just now, I mean; I change every three days. Wuthering Heights. Emily Brontë was quite young when she wrote it, and had never been outside of Haworth churchyard. She had never known any men in her life; how could she imagine a man like Heathcliffe?

I couldn't do it, and I'm quite young and never outside the John Grier asylum—I've had every chance in the world. Sometimes a dreadful fear comes over me that I'm not a genius. Will you be awfully disappointed, Daddy, if I don't turn out to be a great author? In the spring when everything is so beautiful and green and budding, I feel like turning my back on lessons, and running away to play with the weather. There are such lots of adventures out in the fields! It's much more entertaining to live books than to write them.

Ow ! ! !

That was a shriek which brought Sallie and Julia and (for a disgusted moment) the senior from across the hall. It was caused by a centipede like this：



only worse. Just as I had finished the last sentence and was thinking what to say next—plump!—it fell off the ceiling and landed at my side. I tipped two cups off the tea table in trying to get away. Sallie whacked it with the back of my hairbrush—which I shall never be able to use again—and killed the front end, but the rear fifty feet ran under the bureau and escaped.

This dormitory, owing to its age and ivy-covered walls, is full of centipedes. They are dreadful creatures. I'd rather find a tiger under the bed.





Friday, 9.30 P. M.

Such a lot of troubles! I didn't hear the rising bell this morning, then I broke my shoestring while I was hurrying to dress and dropped my collar button down my neck. I was late for breakfast and also for first-hour recitation. I forgot to take any blotting paper and my fountain pen leaked. In trigonometry the professor and I had a disagreement touching a little matter of logarithms. On looking it up, I find that she was right. We had mutton stew and pie-plant for lunch—hate 'em both; they taste like the asylum. Nothing but bills in my mail (though I must say that I never do get anything else; my family are not the kind that write). In English class this afternoon we had an unexpected written lesson. This was it：

I asked no other thing,

No other was denied.

I offered Being for it;

The mighty merchant smiled.




Brazil? He twirled a button

Without a glance my way：

But, madam, is there nothing eIse

That we can show today?

That is a poem. I don't know who wrote it or what it means. It was simply printed out on the blackboard when we arrived and we were ordered to comment upon it. When I read the first verse I thought I had an idea—The mighty merchant was a divinity who distributes blessings in return for virtuous deeds—but when I got to the second verse and found him twirling a button, it seemed a blasphemous supposition, and I hastily changed my mind. The rest of the class was in the same predicament; and there we sat for three quarters of an hour with blank paper and equally blank minds. Getting an education is an awfully wearing process!

But this didn't end the day. There's worse to come.

It rained so we couldn't play golf, but had to go to gymnasium instead. The girl next to me banged my elbow with an Indian club. I got home to find that the box with my new blue spring dress had come, and the skirt was so tight that I couldn't sit down. Friday is sweeping day, and the maid had mixed all the papers on my desk. We had tombstone for dessert (milk and gelatin flavored with vanilla). We were kept in chapel twenty minutes later than usual to listen to a speech about womanly women. And then—just as I was settling down with a sigh of well-earned relief to The Portrait of a Lady, a girl named Ackerly, a dough-faced, deadly, unintermittently stupid girl, who sits next to me in Latin because her name begins with A (I wish Mrs. Lippett had named me Zabriski), came to ask if Monday's lesson commenced at paragraph 69 or 70, and stayed ONE HOUR. She has just gone.

Did you ever hear of such a discouraging series of events? It isn't the big troubles in life that require character. Anybody can rise to a crisis and face a crushing tragedy with courage, but to meet the petty hazards of the day with a laugh—I really think that requires spirit.

It's the kind of character that I am going to develop. I am going to pretend that all life is just a game which I must play as skilfully and fairly as I can. If I lose, I am going to shrug my shoulders and laugh—also if I win.

Anyway, I am going to be a sport. You will never hear me complain again, Daddy dear, because Julia wears silk stockings and centipedes drop off the wall.

Answer soon.

Yours ever,

Judy





May 27th

Daddy-Long-Legs, esq.

Dear Sir：I am in receipt of a letter from Mrs. Lippett. She hopes that I am doing well in deportment and studies. Since I probably have no place to go this summer, she will let me come back to the asylum and work for my board until college opens.

I HATE THE JOHN GRIER HOME.

I'd rather die than go back.

Yours most truthfully,

Jerusha Abbott





Cher Daddy-Fambes-Longes,

Vous etes un brick!

Je suis tres heureuse about the farm, parsque je n'ai jamais been on a farm dans ma vie and I'd hate to retourner chez John Grier, et wash dishes tout l'été. There would be danger of quelque chose affreuse happening, parsque j'ai perdue ma humilité d'autre fois et j'ai peur that I would just break out quelque jour et smash every cup and saucer dans la maison.

Pardon brièveté et paper. Je ne peux pas send des mes nouvelles parseque je suis dans French class et j'ai peur que Monsieur le Professeur is going to call on me tout de suite.

He did!

Au revoir,

Je vous aime beaucoup.

Judy





May 30th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Did you ever see this campus? (That is merely a rhetorical question. Don't let it annoy you.) It is a heavenly spot in May. All the shrubs are in blossom and the trees are the loveliest young green—even the old pines look fresh and new. The grass is dotted with yellow dandelions and hundreds of girls in blue and white and pink dresses. Everybody is joyous and carefree, for vacation's coming, and with that to look forward to, examinations don't count.

Isn't that a happy frame of mind to be in? And oh, Daddy! I'm the happiest of all! Because I'm not in the asylum any more; and I'm not anybody's nursemaid or typewriter or bookkeeper (I should have been, you know, except for you).

I'm sorry now for all my past badnesses.

I'm sorry I was ever impertinent to Mrs. Lippett.

I'm sorry I ever slapped Freddie Perkins.

I'm sorry I ever filled the sugar bowl with salt.

I'm sorry I ever made faces behind the Trustees' backs.

I'm going to be good and sweet and kind to everybody because I'm so happy. And this summer I'm going to write and write and write and begin to be a great author. Isn't that an exalted stand to take? Oh, I'm developing a beautiful character! It droops a bit under cold and frost, but it does grow fast when the sun shines.

That's the way with everybody. I don't agree with the theory that adversity and sorrow and disappointment develop moral strength. The happy people are the ones who are bubbling over with kindliness. I have no faith in misanthropes. (Fine word! Just learned it.) You are not a misanthrope, are you, Daddy?

I started to tell you about the campus. I wish you'd come for a little visit and let me walk you about and say：

“That is the library. This is the gas plant, Daddy dear. The Gothic building on your left is the gymnasium, and the Tudor Romanesque beside it is the new infirmary.”

Oh, I'm fine at showing people about. I've done it all my life at the asylum, and I've been doing it all day here. I have honestly.

And a Man, too!

That's a great experience. I never talked to a man before (except occasional Trustees, and they don't count). Pardon, Daddy. I don't mean to hurt your feelings when I abuse Trustees. I don't consider that you really belong among them. You just tumbled onto the Board by chance. The Trustee, as such, is fat and pompous and benevolent. He pats one on the head and wears a gold watch chain.

That looks like a June bug, but is meant to be a portrait of any Trustee except you.



However—to resume：

I have been walking and talking and having tea with a man. And with a very superior man—with Mr. Jervis Pendleton of the House of Julia; her uncle, in short (in long, perhaps I ought to say; he's as tall as you). Being in town on business, he decided to run out to the college and call on his niece. He's her father's youngest brother, but she doesn't know him very intimately. It seems he glanced at her when she was a baby, decided he didn't like her, and has never noticed her since.

Anyway, there he was, sitting in the reception room very proper with his hat and stick and gloves beside him; and Julia and Sallie with seventh-hour recitations that they couldn't cut. So Julia dashed into my room and begged me to walk him about the campus and then deliver him to her when the seventh hour was over. I said I would, obligingly but unenthusiastically, because I don't care much for Pendletons.

But he turned out to be a sweet lamb. He's a real human being—not a Pendleton at all. We had a beautiful time; I've longed for an uncle ever since. Do you mind pretending you're my uncle? I believe they're superior to grandmothers.

Mr. Pendleton reminded me a little of you, Daddy, as you were twenty years ago. You see I know you intimately, even if we haven't ever met!

He's tall and thinnish with a dark face all over lines, and the funniest underneath smile that never quite comes through but just wrinkles up the corners of his mouth. And he has a way of making you feel right off as though you'd known him a long time. He's very companionable.

We walked all over the campus from the quadrangle to the athletic grounds; then he said he felt weak and must have some tea. He proposed that we go to College Inn—it's just off the campus by the pine walk. I said we ought to go back for Julia and Sallie, but he said he didn't like to have his nieces drink too much tea; it made them nervous. So we just ran away and had tea and muffins and marmalade and ice cream and cake at a nice little table out on the balcony. The inn was quite conveniently empty, this being the end of the month and allowances low.

We had the jolliest time! But he had to run for his train the minute he got back and he barely saw Julia at all. She was furious with me for taking him off; it seems he's an unusually rich and desirable uncle. It relieved my mind to find he was rich, for the tea and things cost sixty cents apiece.

This morning (it's Monday now) three boxes of chocolates came by express for Julia and Sallie and me. What do you think of that? To be getting candy from a man!

I begin to feel like a girl instead of a foundling.

I wish you'd come and take tea some day and let me see if I like you. But wouldn't it be dreadful if I didn't? However, I know I should.

Bien! I make you my compliments.

“Jamais je ne t'oublierai.”

Judy

P. S. I looked in the glass this morning and found a perfectly new dimple that I'd never seen before. It's very curious. Where do you suppose it came from?





June 9th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Happy day! I've just finished my last examination—physiology. And now：

Three months on a farm!

I don't know what kind of a thing a farm is. I've never been on one in my life. I've never even looked at one (except from the car window), but I know I'm going to love it, and I'm going to love being free.

I am not used even yet to being outside the John Grier Home. Whenever I think of it excited little thrills chase up and down my back. I feel as though I must run faster and faster and keep looking over my shoulder to make sure that Mrs. Lippett isn't after me with her arm stretched out to grab me back.

I don't have to mind any one this summer, do I?

Your nominal authority doesn't annoy me in the least; you are too far away to do any harm. Mrs. Lippett is dead forever, so far as I am concerned, and the Semples aren't expected to overlook my moral welfare, are they? No, I am sure not. I am entirely grown up. Hurrah!

I leave you now to pack a trunk, and three boxes of teakettles and dishes and sofa cushions and books.

Yours ever,

Judy

P. S. Here is my physiology exam. Do you think you could have passed?





Lock Willow Farm,

Saturday night

Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,

I've only just come and I'm not unpacked, but I can't wait to tell you how much I like farms. This is a heavenly, heavenly, heavenly spot! The house is square like this：



And old. A hundred years or so. It has a veranda on the side which I can't draw and a sweet porch in front. The picture really doesn't do it justice—those things that look like feather dusters are maple trees, and the prickly ones that border the drive are murmuring pines and hemlocks. It stands on the top of a hill and looks way off over miles of green meadows to another line of hills.



That is the way Connecticut goes, in a series of Marcelle waves; and Lock Willow Farm is just on the crest of one wave. The barns used to be across the road where they obstructed the view, but a kind flash of lightning came from heaven and burnt them down.

The people are Mr. and Mrs. Semple and a hired girl and two hired men. The hired people eat in the kitchen, and the Semples and Judy in the dining room. We had ham and eggs and biscuits and honey and jelly-cake and pie and pickles and cheese and tea for supper—and a great deal of conversation. I have never been so entertaining in my life; everything I say appears to be funny. I suppose it is, because I've never been in the country before, and my questions are backed by an all-inclusive ignorance.

The room marked with a cross is not where the murder was committed, but the one that I occupy. It's big and square and empty, with adorable old-fashioned furniture and windows that have to be propped up on sticks and green shades trimmed with gold that fall down if you touch them. And a big square mahogany table—I'm going to spend the summer with my elbows spread out on it, writing a novel.

Oh, Daddy, I'm so excited! I can't wait till daylight to explore. It's 8：30 now, and I am about to blow out my candle and try to go to sleep. We rise at five. Did you ever know such fun? I can't believe this is really Judy. You and the Good Lord give me more than I deserve. I must be a very, very, very good person to pay. I'm going to be. You'll see.

Good night,

Judy

P. S. You should hear the frogs sing and the little pigs squeal—and you should see the new moon! I saw it over my right shoulder.





Lock Willow,

July 12th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

How did your secretary come to know about Lock Willow? (That isn't a rhetorical question. I am awfully curious to know.) For listen to this：Mr. Jervis Pendleton used to own this farm, but now he has given it to Mrs. Semple who was his old nurse. Did you ever hear of such a funny coincidence? She still calls him “Master Jervie” and talks about what a sweet little boy he used to be. She has one of his baby curls put away in a box, and it's red—or at least reddish!

Since she discovered that I know him, I have risen very much in her opinion. Knowing a member of the Pendleton family is the best introduction one can have at Lock Willow. And the cream of the whole family is Master Jervie—I am pleased to say that Julia belongs to an inferior branch.

The farm gets more and more entertaining. I rode on a hay wagon yesterday. We have three big pigs and nine little piglets, and you should see them eat. They are pigs! We've oceans of little baby chickens and ducks and turkeys and guinea fowls. You must be mad to live in a city when you might live on a farm.

It is my daily business to hunt the eggs. I fell off a beam in the barn loft yesterday, while I was trying to crawl over to a nest that the black hen has stolen. And when I came in with a scratched knee, Mrs. Semple bound it up with witch hazel, murmuring all the time, “Dear! Dear! It seems only yesterday that Master Jervie fell off that very same beam and scratched this very same knee.”

The scenery around here is perfectly beautiful. There's a valley and a river and a lot of wooded hills, and way in the distance, a tall blue mountain that simply melts in your mouth.

We churn twice a week; and we keep the cream in the spring house which is made of stone with the brook running underneath. Some of the farmers around here have a separator, but we don't care for these new-fashioned ideas. It may be a little harder to take care of cream raised in pans, but it's enough better to pay. We have six calves; and I've chosen the names for all of them.

1. Sylvia, because she was born in the woods.

2. Lesbia, after the Lesbia in Catullus.

3. Sallie.

4. Julia—a spotted, nondescript animal.

5. Judy, after me.

6. Daddy-Long-Legs. You don't mind, do you, Daddy? He's pure Jersey and has a sweet disposition. He looks like this—you can see how appropriate the name is.



I haven't had time yet to begin my immortal novel; the farm keeps me too busy.

Yours always,

Judy

Sunday

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Isn't it funny? I started to write to you yesterday afternoon, but as far as I got was the heading, “Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,” and then I remembered I'd promised to pick some blackberries for supper, so I went off and left the sheet lying on the table, and when I came back today, what do you think I found sitting in the middle of the page? A real true Daddy-Long-Legs!



I picked him up very gently by one leg, and dropped him out of the window. I wouldn't hurt one of them for the world. They always remind me of you.

We hitched up the spring wagon this morning and drove to the Center to church. It's a sweet little white frame church with a spire and three Doric columns in front (or maybe Ionic—I always get them mixed).

A nice, sleepy sermon with everybody drowsily waving palmleaf fans, and the only sound aside from the minister, the buzzing of locusts in the trees outside. I didn't wake up till I found myself on my feet singing the hymn, and then I was awfully sorry I hadn't listened to the sermon; I should like to know more of the psychology of a man who would pick out such a hymn. This was it：

Come, leave your sports and earthly toys

And join me in celestiaI joys.

Or else, dear friend, a Iong farewell.

I leave you now to sink to hell.

I find that it isn't safe to discuss religion with the Semples. Their God (whom they have inherited intact from their remote Puritan ancestors) is a narrow, irrational, unjust, mean, revengeful, bigoted person. Thank heaven I don't inherit any God from anybody! I am free to make mine up as I wish him. He's kind and sympathetic and imaginative and forgiving and understanding—and he has a sense of humor.

I like the Semples immensely; their practice is so superior to their theory. They are better than their own God. I told them so—and they are horribly troubled. They think I am blasphemous—and I think they are! We've dropped theology from our conversation.

This is Sunday afternoon.

Amasai (hired man) in a purple tie and some bright yellow buckskin gloves, very red and shaved, has just driven off with Carrie (hired girl) in a big hat trimmed with red roses and a blue muslin dress and her hair curled as tight as it will curl. Amasai spent all the morning washing the buggy; and Carrie stayed home from church ostensibly to cook the dinner, but really to iron the muslin dress.

In two minutes more when this letter is finished I am going to settle down to a book which I found in the attic. It's entitled On the Trail, and sprawled across the front page in a funny little-boy hand：

Jervis Pendleton

If this book shouId ever roam,

Box its ears and send it home.

He spent the summer here once after he had been ill, when he was about eleven years old; and he left On the Trail behind. It looks well read—the marks of his grimy little hands are frequent! Also in a corner of the attic there is a water wheel and a windmill and some bows and arrows. Mrs. Semple talks so constantly about him that I begin to believe he really lives—not a grown man with a silk hat and walking stick, but a nice, dirty, tousle-headed boy who clatters up the stairs with an awful racket, and leaves the screen doors open, and is always asking for cookies. (And getting them, too, if I know Mrs. Semple!) He seems to have been an adventurous little soul—and brave and truthful. I'm sorry to think he is a Pendleton; he was meant for something better.

We're going to begin threshing oats tomorrow; a steam engine is coming and three extra men.

It grieves me to tell you that Buttercup (the spotted cow with one horn, mother of Lesbia) has done a disgraceful thing. She got into the orchard Friday evening and ate apples under the trees, and ate and ate until they went to her head. For two days she has been perfectly dead drunk! That is the truth I am telling. Did you ever hear anything so scandalous?

Sir,

I remain,

Your affectionate orphan,

Judy Abbott

P. S. Indians in the first chapter and highwaymen in the second. I hold my breath. What can the third contain? “Red Hawk leapt twenty feet in the air and bit the dust.” That is the subject of the frontispiece. Aren't Judy and Jervie having fun?





September 15th

Dear Daddy,

I was weighed yesterday on the flour scales in the general store at the Corners. I've gained nine pounds! Let me recommend Lock Willow as a health resort.

Yours ever,

Judy





September 25th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Behold me—a sophomore! I came up last Friday, sorry to leave Lock Willow, but glad to see the campus again. It is a pleasant sensation to come back to something familiar. I am beginning to feel at home in college, and in command of the situation; I am beginning, in fact, to feel at home in the world—as though I really belonged in it and had not just crept in on sufferance.

I don't suppose you understand in the least what I am trying to say. A person important enough to be a Trustee can't appreciate the feelings of a person unimportant enough to be a foundling.

And now, Daddy, listen to this. Whom do you think I am rooming with? Sallie McBride and Julia Rutledge Pendleton. It's the truth. We have a study and three little bedrooms—voilà!



Sallie and I decided last spring that we should like to room together, and Julia made up her mind to stay with Sallie—why, I can't imagine, for they are not a bit alike; but the Pendletons are naturally conservative and inimical (fine word!) to change. Anyway, here we are. Think of Jerusha Abbott, late of the John Grier Home for Orphans, rooming with a Pendleton. This is a democratic country.

Sallie is running for class president, and unless all signs fail, she is going to be elected. Such an atmosphere of intrigue—you should see what politicians we are! Oh, I tell you, Daddy, when we women get our rights, you men will have to look alive in order to keep yours. Election comes next Saturday, and we're going to have a torchlight procession in the evening, no matter who wins.

I am beginning chemistry, a most unusual study. I've never seen anything like it before. Molecules and atoms are the material employed, but I'll be in a position to discuss them more definitely next month.

I am also taking argumentation and logic.

Also history of the whole world.

Also plays of William Shakespeare.

Also French.

If this keeps up many years longer, I shall become quite intelligent.

I should rather have elected economics than French, but I didn't dare, because I was afraid that unless I reelected French, the professor would not let me pass—as it was, I just managed to squeeze through the June examination. But I will say that my high-school preparation was not very adequate.

There's one girl in the class who chatters away in French as fast as she does in English. She went abroad with her parents when she was a child, and spent three years in a convent school. You can imagine how bright she is compared with the rest of us—irregular verbs are mere playthings. I wish my parents had chucked me into a French convent when I was little instead of a foundling asylum. Oh, no, I don't either! Because then maybe I should never have known you. I'd rather know you than French.

Good-bye, Daddy. I must call on Harriet Martin now, and, having discussed the chemical situation, casually drop a few thoughts on the subject of our next president.

Yours in politics,

J. Abbott.





October 17th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Supposing the swimming tank in the gymnasium were filled full of lemon jelly, could a person trying to swim manage to keep on top or would he sink?

We were having lemon jelly for dessert, when the question came up. We discussed it heatedly for half an hour and it's still unsettled. Sallie thinks that she could swim in it, but I am perfectly sure that the best swimmer in the world would sink. Wouldn't it be funny to be drowned in lemon jelly?

Two other problems are engaging the attention of our table.

1st. What shape are the rooms in an octagon house? Some of the girls insist that they're square; but I think they'd have to be shaped like a piece of pie. Don't you?

2nd. Suppose there were a great big hollow sphere made of looking glass and you were sitting inside. Where would it stop reflecting your face and begin reflecting your back? The more one thinks about this problem, the more puzzling it becomes. You can see with what deep philosophical reflection we engage our leisure!

Did I ever tell you about the election? It happened three weeks ago, but so fast do we live, that three weeks is ancient history. Sallie was elected, and we had a torchlight parade with transparencies saying, “McBride Forever,” and a band consisting of fourteen pieces (three mouth organs and eleven combs).

We're very important persons now in “258”. Julia and I come in for a great deal of reflected glory. It's quite a social strain to be living in the same house with a president.



Bonne nuit, cher Daddy.

Acceptez mes compliments,

Très respectueux.

Je suis,

Votre Judy.





November 12th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

We beat the freshmen at basketball yesterday. Of course we're pleased—but oh, if we could only beat the juniors! I'd be willing to be black and blue all over and stay in bed a week in a witch-hazel compress.

Sallie has invited me to spend the Christmas vacation with her. She lives in Worcester, Massachusetts. Wasn't it nice of her? I shall love to go. I've never been in a private family in my life, except at Lock Willow, and the Semples were grown-up and old and don't count. But the McBrides have a houseful of children (anyway two or three) and a mother and father and grandmother, and an Angora cat. It's a perfectly complete family! Packing your trunk and going away is more fun than staying behind. I am terribly excited at the prospect.

Seventh hour—I must run to rehearsal. I'm to be in the Thanksgiving theatricals. A prince in a tower with a velvet tunic and yellow curls. Isn't that a lark?

Yours,

J. A.





Saturday

Do you want to know what I look like? Here's a photograph of all three that Leonora Fenton took.

The light one who is laughing is Sallie, and the tall one with her nose in the air is Julia, and the little one with the hair blowing across her face is Judy—she is really more beautiful than that, but the sun was in her eyes.





“Stone Gate,”

Worcester, Mass.,

December 31st

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I meant to write to you before and thank you for your Christmas check, but life in the McBride household is very absorbing, and I don't seem able to find two consecutive minutes to spend at a desk.

I bought a new gown—one that I didn't need, but just wanted. My Christmas present this year is from Daddy-Long-Legs; my family just sent love.

I've been having the most beautiful vacation visiting Sallie. She lives in a big old-fashioned brick house with white trimmings set back from the street—exactly the kind of house that I used to look at so curiously when I was in the John Grier Home, and wonder what it could be like inside. I never expected to see with my own eyes—but here I am! Everything is so comfortable and restful and homelike; I walk from room to room and drink in the furnishings.

It is the most perfect house for children to be brought up in; with shadowy nooks for hide and seek, and open fireplaces for popcorn, and an attic to romp in on rainy days, and slippery banisters with a comfortable flat knob at the bottom, and a great big sunny kitchen, and a nice, fat, sunny cook, who has lived in the family thirteen years and always saves out a piece of dough for the children to bake. Just the sight of such a house makes you want to be a child all over again.

And as for families! I never dreamed they could be so nice. Sallie has a father and mother and grandmother, and the sweetest three-year-old baby sister all over curls, and a medium-sized brother who always forgets to wipe his feet, and a big, good-looking brother named Jimmie, who is a junior at Princeton.

We have the jolliest times at the table—everybody laughs and jokes and talks at once, and we don't have to say grace beforehand. It's a relief not having to thank somebody for every mouthful you eat. (I dare say I'm blasphemous; but you'd be, too, if you'd offered as much obligatory thanks as I have.)

Such a lot of things we've done—I can't begin to tell you about them. Mr. McBride owns a factory, and Christmas eve he had a tree for the employees' children. It was in the long packing room, which was decorated with evergreens and holly. Jimmie McBride was dressed as Santa Claus, and Sallie and I helped him distribute the presents. Dear me, Daddy, but it was a funny sensation! I felt as benevolent as a Trustee of the John Grier Home. I kissed one sweet, sticky little boy—but I don't think I patted any of them on the head!

And two days after Christmas, they gave a dance at their own house for ME.

It was the first really true ball I ever attended—college doesn't count where we dance with girls. I had a new white evening gown (your Christmas present—many thanks) and long white gloves and white satin slippers. The only drawback to my perfect, utter, absolute happiness was the fact that Mrs. Lippett couldn't see me leading the cotillion with Jimmie McBride. Tell her about it, please, the next time you visit the J. G. H.

Yours ever,

Judy Abbott

P. S. Would you be terribly displeased, Daddy, if I didn't turn out to be a Great Author after all, but just a Plain Girl?





6：30, Saturday

Dear Daddy,

We started to walk to town today, but mercy! how it poured. I like winter to be winter with snow instead of rain.

Julia's desirable uncle called again this afternoon—and brought a five-pound box of chocolates. There are advantages you see about rooming with Julia.

Our innocent prattle appeared to amuse him and he waited over a train in order to take tea in the study. And an awful lot of trouble we had getting permission. It's hard enough entertaining fathers and grandfathers, but uncles are a step worse; and as for brothers and cousins, they are next to impossible. Julia had to swear that he was her uncle before a notary public and then have the county clerk's certificate attached. (Don't I know a lot of law?) And even then I doubt if we could have had our tea if the dean had chanced to see how youngish and good-looking Uncle Jervis is.

Anyway, we had it, with brown bread, Swiss cheese sandwiches. He helped make them and then ate four. I told him that I had spent last summer at Lock Willow, and we had a beautiful gossipy time about the Semples, and the horses and cows and chickens. All the horses that he used to know are dead, except Grover, who was a baby colt at the time of his last visit—and poor Grove now is so old he can just limp about the pasture.

He asked if they still kept doughnuts in a yellow crock with a blue plate over it on the bottom shelf of the pantry—and they do! He wanted to know if there was still a woodchuck's hole under the pile of rocks in the night pasture—and there is! Amasai caught a big, fat, gray one there this summer, the twenty-fifth great-grandson of the one Master Jervie caught when he was a little boy.

I called him “Master Jervie” to his face, but he didn't appear to be insulted. Julia says that she has never seen him so amiable; he's usually pretty unapproachable. But Julia hasn't a bit of tact; and men, I find, require a great deal. They purr if you rub them the right way and spit if you don't. (That isn't a very elegant metaphor. I mean it figuratively.)

We're reading Marie Bashkirtseff's journal. Isn't it amazing? Listen to this：“Last night I was seized by a fit of despair that found utterance in moans, and that finally drove me to throw the dining room clock into the sea.”

It makes me almost hope I'm not a genius; they must be very wearing to have about—and awfully destructive to the furniture.

Mercy! how it keeps pouring. We shall have to swim to chapel tonight.

Yours ever,

Judy



Jan. 20th





Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Did you ever have a sweet baby girl who was stolen from the cradle in infancy?

Maybe I am she! If we were in a novel, that would be the denouement, wouldn't it?

It's really awfully queer not to know what one is—sort of exciting and romantic. There are such a lot of possibilities. Maybe I'm not American; lots of people aren't. I may be straight descended from the ancient Romans, or I may be a Viking's daughter, or I may be the child of a Russian exile and belong by rights in a Siberian prison, or maybe I'm a Gipsy—I think perhaps I am. I have a very wandering spirit, though I haven't as yet had much chance to develop it.

Do you know about that one scandalous blot in my career—the time I ran away from the asylum because they punished me for stealing cookies? It's down in the books free for any Trustee to read. But really, Daddy, what could you expect? When you put a hungry little nine-year girl in the pantry scouring knives, with the cookie jar at her elbow, and go off and leave her alone; and then suddenly pop in again, wouldn't you expect to find her a bit crumby? And then when you jerk her by the elbow and box her ears, and make her leave the table when the pudding comes, and tell all the other children that it's because she's a thief, wouldn't you expect her to run away?

I only ran four miles. They caught me and brought me back; and every day for a week I was tied, like a naughty puppy, to a stake in the back yard while the other children were out at recess.

Oh, dear! There's the chapel bell, and after chapel I have a committee meeting. I'm sorry because I meant to write you a very entertaining letter this time.

Auf Wiedersehen

Cher Daddy

Pax tibi!

Judy

P. S. There's one thing I'm perfectly sure of. I'm not a Chinaman.





February 4th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Jimmie McBride has sent me a Princeton banner as big as one end of the room; I am very grateful to him for remembering me, but I don't know what on earth to do with it. Sallie and Julia won't let me hang it up; our room this year is furnished in red, and you can imagine what an effect we'd have if I added orange and black. But it's such nice, warm, thick felt, I hate to waste it. Would it be very improper to have it made into a bathrobe? My old one shrank when it was washed.



I've entirely omitted of late telling you what I am learning, but though you might not imagine it from my letters, my time is exclusively occupied with study. It's a very bewildering matter to get educated in five branches at once.

“The test of true scholarship,” says chemistry professor, “is a painstaking passion for detail.”

“Be careful not to keep your eyes glued to detail,” says history professor. “Stand far enough away to get a perspective on the whole.”

You can see with what nicety we have to trim our sails between chemistry and history. I like the historical method best. If I say that William the Conqueror came over in 1492, and Columbus discovered America in 1100 or 1066 or whenever it was, that's a mere detail that the professor overlooks. It gives a feeling of security and restfulness to the history recitation that is entirely lacking in chemistry.

Sixth-hour bell—I must go to the laboratory and look into a little matter of acids and salts and alkalis. I've burned a hole as big as a plate in the front of my chemistry apron, with hydrochloric acid. If the theory worked, I ought to be able to neutralize that hole with good strong ammonia, oughtn't I?

Examinations next week, but who's afraid?

Yours ever,

Judy





March 5th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

There is a March wind blowing, and the sky is filled with heavy, black moving clouds. The crows in the pine trees are making such a clamor! It's an intoxicating, exhilarating, calling noise. You want to close your books and be off over the hills to race with the wind.

We had a paper chase last Saturday over five miles of squashy 'cross country. The fox (composed of three girls and a bushel or so of confetti) started half an hour before the twenty-seven hunters. I was one of the twenty-seven; eight dropped by the wayside; we ended nineteen. The trail led over a hill, through a cornfield, and into a swamp where we had to leap lightly from hummock to hummock. Of course half of us went in ankle deep. We kept losing the trail, and wasted twenty-five minutes over that swamp. Then up a hill through some woods and in at a barn window! The barn doors were all locked and the window was up high and pretty small. I don't call that fair, do you?

But we didn't go through; we circumnavigated the barn and picked up the trail where it issued by way of a low shed roof onto the top of a fence. The fox thought he had us there, but we fooled him. Then straight away over two miles of rolling meadow, and awfully hard to follow, for the confetti was getting sparse. The rule is that it must be at the most six feet apart, but they were the longest six feet I ever saw. Finally, after two hours of steady trotting, we tracked Monsieur Fox into the kitchen of Crystal Spring (that's a farm where the girls go in bob sleighs and hay wagons for chicken and waffle suppers) and we found the three foxes placidly eating milk and honey and biscuits. They hadn't thought we would get that far; they were expecting us to stick in the barn window.

Both sides insist that they won. I think we did, don't you? Because we caught them before they got back to the campus. Anyway, all nineteen of us settled like locusts over the furniture and clamored for honey. There wasn't enough to go round, but Mrs. Crystal Spring (that's our pet name for her; she's by rights a Johnson) brought up a jar of strawberry jam and a can of maple syrup—just made last week—and three loaves of brown bread.

We didn't get back to college till half-past six—half an hour late for dinner—and we went straight in without dressing, and with perfectly unimpaired appetites! Then we all cut evening chapel, the state of our boots being enough of an excuse.

I never told you about examinations. I passed everything with the utmost ease—I know the secret now, and am never going to flunk again. I shan't be able to graduate with honors though, because of that beastly Latin prose and geometry freshman year. But I don't care. Wot's the hodds so long as you're 'appy? (That's a quotation. I've been reading the English classics.)

Speaking of classics, have you ever read Hamlet? If you haven't, do it right off. It's perfectly corking. I've been hearing about Shakespeare all my life, but I had no idea he really wrote so well; I always suspected him of going largely on his reputation.

I have a beautiful play that I invented a long time ago when I first learned to read. I put myself to sleep every night by pretending I'm the person (the most important person) in the book I'm reading at the moment.

At present I'm Ophelia—and such a sensible Ophelia! I keep Hamlet amused all the time, and pet him and scold him and make him wrap up his throat when he has a cold. I've entirely cured him of being melancholy. The King and Queen are both dead—an accident at sea; no funeral necessary—so Hamlet and I are ruling in Denmark without any bother. We have the kingdom working beautifully. He takes care of the governing, and I look after the charities. I have just founded some first-class orphan asylums. If you or any of the other Trustees would like to visit them, I shall be pleased to show you through. I think you might find a great many helpful suggestions.

I remain, sir,

Yours most graciously,

Ophelia,

Queen of Denmark.





March 24th

maybe the 25th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I don't believe I can be going to Heaven—I am getting such a lot of good things here; it wouldn't be fair to get them hereafter, too. Listen to what has happened.

Jerusha Abbott has won the short-story contest (a twenty-five dollar prize) that the Monthly holds every year. And she a sophomore! The contestants are mostly seniors. When I saw my name posted, I couldn't quite believe it was true. Maybe I am going to be an author after all. I wish Mrs. Lippett hadn't given me such a silly name—it sounds like an authoress, doesn't it?

Also I have been chosen for the spring dramatics—As You Like It out of doors. I am going to be Celia, own cousin to Rosalind.

And lastly：Julia and Sallie and I are going to New York next Friday to do some spring shopping and stay all night and go to the theater the next day with “Master Jervie.” He invited us. Julia is going to stay at home with her family, but Sallie and I are going to stop at the Martha Washington Hotel. Did you ever hear of anything so exciting? I've never been in a hotel in my life, nor in a theater; except once when the Catholic church had a festival and invited the orphans, but that wasn't a real play and it doesn't count.

And what do you think we're going to see? Hamlet. Think of that! We studied it for four weeks in Shakespeare class and I know it by heart.

I am so excited over all these prospects that I can scarcely sleep.

Good-bye, Daddy.

This is a very entertaining world.

Yours ever,

Judy

P. S. I've just looked at the calendar. It's the 28th.

Another postscript.

I saw a street car conductor today with one brown eye and one blue. Wouldn't he make a nice villain for a detective story?





April 7th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Mercy! Isn't New York big? Worcester is nothing to it. Do you mean to tell me that you actually live in all that confusion? I don't believe that I shall recover for months from the bewildering effect of two days of it. I can't begin to tell you all the amazing things I've seen; I suppose you know, though, since you live there yourself.

But aren't the streets entertaining? And the people? And the shops? I never saw such lovely things as there are in the windows. It makes you want to devote your life to wearing clothes.

Sallie and Julia and I went shopping together Saturday morning. Julia went into the very most gorgeous place I ever saw, white and gold walls and blue carpets and blue silk curtains and gilt chairs. A perfectly beautiful lady with yellow hair and a long black silk trailing gown came to meet us with a welcoming smile. I thought we were paying a social call, and started to shake hands, but it seems we were only buying hats—at least Julia was. She sat down in front of a mirror and tried on a dozen, each lovelier than the last, and bought the two loveliest of all.

I can't imagine any joy in life greater than sitting down in front of a mirror and buying any hat you choose without having first to consider the price! There's no doubt about it, Daddy; New York would rapidly undermine this fine, stoical character which the John Grier Home so patiently built up.

And after we'd finished our shopping, we met Master Jervie at Sherry's. I suppose you've been in Sherry's? Picture that, then picture the dining room of the John Grier Home with its oilcloth-covered tables, and white crockery that you can't break, and wooden-handled knives and forks; and fancy the way I felt!

I ate my fish with the wrong fork, but the waiter very kindly gave me another so that nobody noticed.

And after luncheon we went to the theater—it was dazzling, marvelous, unbelievable—I dream about it every night.

Isn't Shakespeare wonderful?

Hamlet is so much better on the stage than when we analyze it in class; I appreciated it before, but now, dear me!

I think, if you don't mind, that I'd rather be an actress than a writer. Wouldn't you like me to leave college and go into a dramatic school? And then I'll send you a box for all my performances, and smile at you across the footlights. Only wear a red rose in your buttonhole, please, so I'll surely smile at the right man. It would be an awfully embarrassing mistake if I picked out the wrong one.

We came back Saturday night and had our dinner in the train, at little tables with pink lamps and negro waiters. I never heard of meals being served in trains before, and I inadvertently said so.

“Where on earth were you brought up?” said Julia to me.

“In a village,” said I, meekly to Julia.

“But didn't you ever travel?” said she to me.

“Not till I came to college, and then it was only a hundred and sixty miles and we didn't eat,” said I to her.

She's getting quite interested in me, because I say such funny things. I try hard not to, but they do pop out when I'm surprised—and I'm surprised most of the time. It's a dizzying experience, Daddy, to pass eighteen years in the John Grier Home, and then suddenly to be plunged into the WORLD.

But I'm getting acclimated. I don't make such awful mistakes as I did; and I don't feel uncomfortable any more with the other girls. I used to squirm whenever people looked at me. I felt as though they saw right through my sham new clothes to the checked ginghams underneath. But I'm not letting the ginghams bother me any more. Sufficient unto yesterday is the evil thereof.

I forgot to tell you about our flowers. Master Jervie gave us each a big bunch of violets and lilies of the valley. Wasn't that sweet of him? I never used to care much for men—judging by Trustees—but I'm changing my mind.

Eleven pages—this is a letter! Have courage. I'm going to stop.

Yours always,

Judy





April 10th

Dear Mr. Rich-Man,

Here's your check for fifty dollars. Thank you very much, but I do not feel that I can keep it. My allowance is sufficient to afford all of the hats that I need. I am sorry that I wrote all that silly stuff about the millinery shop; it's just that I had never seen anything like it before.

However, I wasn't begging! And I would rather not accept any more charity than I have to.

Sincerely yours,

Jerusha Abbott





April 11th

Dearest Daddy,

Will you please forgive me for the letter I wrote you yesterday? After I posted it I was sorry, and tried to get it back, but that beastly mail clerk wouldn't give it to me.

It's the middle of the night now; I've been awake for hours thinking what a worm I am—what a Thousand-legged worm—and that's the worst I can say! I've closed the door very softly into the study so as not to wake Julia and Sallie, and am sitting up in bed writing to you on paper torn out of my history notebook.

I just wanted to tell you that I am sorry I was so impolite about your check. I know you meant it kindly, and I think you're an old dear to take so much trouble for such a silly thing as a hat. I ought to have returned it very much more graciously.

But in any case, I had to return it. It's different with me than with other girls. They can take things naturally from people. They have fathers and brothers and aunts and uncles; but I can't be on any such relations with any one. I like to pretend that you belong to me, just to play with the idea, but of course I know you don't. I'm alone, really—with my back to the wall fighting the world—and I get sort of gaspy when I think about it. I put it out of my mind, and keep on pretending; but don't you see, Daddy? I can't accept any more money than I have to, because some day I shall be wanting to pay it back, and even as great an author as I intend to be won't be able to face a perfectly tremendous debt.

I'd love pretty hats and things, but I mustn't mortgage the future to pay for them.

You'll forgive me, won't you, for being so rude? I have an awful habit of writing impulsively when I first think things, and then posting the letter beyond recall. But if I sometimes seem thoughtless and ungrateful, I never mean it. In my heart I thank you always for the life and freedom and independence that you have given me. My childhood was just a long, sullen stretch of revolt, and now I am so happy every moment of the day that I can't believe it's true. I feel like a made-up heroine in a storybook.

It's a quarter past two. I'm going to tiptoe out to the mail chute and get this off now. You'll receive it in the next mail after the other; so you won't have a very long time to think bad of me.

Good night, Daddy,

I love you always,

Judy





May 4th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Field Day last Saturday. It was a very spectacular occasion. First we had a parade of all the classes, with everybody dressed in white linen, the seniors carrying blue and gold Japanese umbrellas, and the juniors white and yellow banners. Our class had crimson balloons—very fetching, especially as they were always getting loose and floating off—and the freshmen wore green tissue-paper hats with long streamers. Also we had a band in blue uniforms hired from town. Also about a dozen funny people, like clowns in a circus, to keep the spectators entertained between events.

Julia was dressed as a fat country man with a linen duster and whiskers and baggy umbrella. Patsy Moriarty (Patricia, really. Did you ever hear such a name? Mrs. Lippett couldn't have done better.), who is tall and thin was Julia's wife in an absurd green bonnet over one ear. Waves of laughter followed them the whole length of the course. Julia played the part extremely well. I never dreamed that a Pendleton could display so much comedy spirit—begging Master Jervie's pardon; I don't consider him a true Pendleton though, any more than I consider you a true Trustee.

Sallie and I weren't in the parade because we were entered for the events. And what do you think? We both won! At least in something.We tried for the running broad jump and lost; but Sallie won the pole vaulting (seven feet three inches) and I won the fifty-yard dash (eight seconds).

I was pretty panting at the end, but it was great fun, with the whole class waving balloons and cheering and yelling：

What's the matter with Judy Abbott?

She's all right.

Who's all right?

Judy Ab-bott!

Judy Wins the Fifty Yard Dash



That, Daddy, is true fame. Then trotting back to the dressing tent and being rubbed down with alcohol and having a lemon to suck. You see we're very professional. It's a fine thing to win an event for your class, because the class that wins the most gets the athletic cup for the year. The seniors won it this year, with seven events to their credit. The athletic association gave a dinner in the gymnasium to all of the winners. We had fried soft-shell crabs, and chocolate ice cream molded in the shape of basket balls.

I sat up half of last night reading Jane Eyre. Are you old enough, Daddy, to remember sixty years ago? And if so, did people talk that way?

The haughty Lady Blanche says to the footman, “Stop your chattering, knave, and do my bidding.” Mr. Rochester talks about the metal welkin when he means the sky; and as for the mad woman who laughs like a hyena and sets fire to bed curtains and tears up wedding veils and bites—it's melodrama of the purest, but just the same, you read and read and read. I can't see how any girl could have written such a book, especially any girl who was brought up in a churchyard. There's something about those Brontës that fascinates me. Their books, their lives, their spirit. Where did they get it? When I was reading about little Jane's troubles in the charity school, I got so angry that I had to go out and take a walk. I understood exactly how she felt. Having known Mrs. Lippett, I could see Mr. Brocklehurst.

Don't be outraged, Daddy. I am not intimating that the John Grier Home was like the Lowood Institute. We had plenty to eat and plenty to wear, sufficient water to wash in, and a furnace in the cellar. But there was one deadly likeness. Our lives were absolutely monotonous and uneventful. Nothing nice ever happened, except ice cream on Sundays, and even that was regular. In all the eighteen years I was there I only had one adventure—when the woodshed burned. We had to get up in the night and dress so as to be ready in case the house should catch. But it didn't catch and we went back to bed.

Everybody likes a few surprises; it's a perfectly natural human craving. But I never had one until Mrs. Lippett called me to the office to tell me that Mr. John Smith was going to send me to college. And then she broke the news so gradually that it just barely shocked me.

You know, Daddy, I think that the most necessary quality for any person to have is imagination. It makes people able to put themselves in other people's places. It makes them kind and sympathetic and understanding. It ought to be cultivated in children. But the John Grier Home instantly stamped out the slightest flicker that appeared. Duty was the one quality that was encouraged. I don't think children ought to know the meaning of the word; it's odious, detestable. They ought to do everything from love.

Wait until you see the orphan asylum that I am going to be the head of! It's my favorite play at night before I go to sleep. I plan it out to the littlest detail—the meals and clothes and study and amusements and punishments; for even my superior orphans are sometimes bad.

But anyway, they are going to be happy. I think that everyone, no matter how many troubles he may have when he grows up, ought to have a happy childhood to look back upon. And if I ever have any children of my own, no matter how unhappy I may be, I am not going to let them have any cares until they grow up.

(There goes the chapel bell—I'll finish this letter sometime.)





Thursday

When I came in from laboratory this afternoon, I found a squirrel sitting on the tea table helping himself to almonds. These are the kind of callers we entertain now that warm weather has come and the window stays open—

“My dear Mrs. centipede, will you have one lump or two?”





Saturday morning

Perhaps you think, last night being Friday, with no classes today, that I passed a nice, quiet, readable evening with the set of Stevenson that I bought with my prize money? But if so, you've never attended a girls' college, Daddy dear. Six friends dropped in to make fudge, and one of them dropped the fudge—while it was still liquid—right in the middle of our best rug. We shall never be able to clean up the mess.

I haven't mentioned any lessons of late, but we are still having them every day. It's sort of a relief though, to get away from them and discuss life in the large—rather one-sided discussions that you and I hold, but that's your own fault. You are welcome to answer back any time you choose.

I've been writing this letter off and on for three days, and I fear by now vous êtes bien bored!

Good-bye, nice Mr. Man,

Judy

June 2nd

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

You will never guess the nice thing that has happened.

The McBrides have asked me to spend the summer at their camp in the Adirondacks! They belong to a sort of club on a lovely little lake in the middle of the woods. The different members have houses made of logs dotted about among the trees, and they go canoeing on the lake, and take long walks through trails to other camps, and have dances once a week in the clubhouse—Jimmie McBride is going to have a college friend visiting him part of the summer, so you see we shall have plenty of men to dance with.

Wasn't it sweet of Mrs. McBride to ask me? It appears that she liked me when I was there for Christmas.

Please excuse this being short. It isn't a real letter; it's just to let you know that I'm disposed of for the summer.

Yours,

In a very contented frame of mind,

Judy





June 5th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Your secretary man has just written to me saying that Mr. Smith prefers that I should not accept Mrs. McBride's invitation, but should return to Lock Willow the same as last summer.

Why, why, why, Daddy?

You don't understand about it. Mrs. McBride does want me, really and truly. I'm not the least bit of trouble in the house. I'm a help. They don't take up many servants, and Sallie and I can do lots of useful things. It's a fine chance for me to learn housekeeping. Every woman ought to understand it, and I only know asylum-keeping.

There aren't any girls our age at the camp, and Mrs. McBride wants me for a companion for Sallie. We are planning to do a lot of reading together. We are going to read all of the books for next year's English and sociology. The professor said it would be a great help if we would get our reading finished in the summer; and it's so much easier to remember it, if we read together and talk it over.

Just to live in the same house with Sallie's mother is an education. She's the most interesting, entertaining, companionable, charming woman in the world; she knows everything. Think how many summers I've spent with Mrs. Lippett and how I'll appreciate the contrast. You needn't be afraid that I'll be crowding them, for their house is made of rubber. When they have a lot of company, they just sprinkle tents about in the woods and turn the boys outside. It's going to be such a nice, healthy summer exercising out of doors every minute. Jimmie McBride is going to teach me how to ride horseback and paddle a canoe, and how to shoot and—oh, lots of things I ought to know. It's the kind of nice, jolly, carefree time that I've never had; and I think every girl deserves it once in her life. Of course I'll do exactly as you say, but please, please let me go, Daddy. I've never wanted anything so much.

This isn't Jerusha Abbott, the future great author, writing to you. It's just Judy—a girl.





June 9th

Mr. John smith,

Sir：Yours of the 7th inst. at hand. In compliance with the instructions received through your secretary, I leave on Friday next to spend the summer at Lock Willow Farm.

I hope always to remain,

(Miss) Jerusha Abbott





Lock Willow Farm,

August Third

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

It has been nearly two months since I wrote, which wasn't nice of me, I know, but I haven't loved you much this summer—you see I'm being frank!

You can't imagine how disappointed I was at having to give up the McBride's camp. Of course I know that you're my guardian, and that I have to regard your wishes in all matters, but I couldn't see any reason. It was so distinctly the best thing that could have happened to me. If I had been Daddy, and you had been Judy, I should have said, “Bless you, my child, run along and have a good time; see lots of new people and learn lots of new things; live out of doors, and get strong and well and rested for a year of hard work.”

But not at all! Just a curt line from your secretary ordering me to Lock Willow.

It's the impersonality of your commands that hurts my feelings. It seems as though, if you felt the tiniest little bit for me the way I feel for you, you'd sometimes send me a message that you'd written with your own hand, instead of those beastly typewritten secretary's notes. If there were the slightest hint that you cared, I'd do anything on earth to please you.

I know that I was to write nice, long, detailed letters without ever expecting any answer. You're living up to your side of the bargain—I'm being educated—and I suppose you're thinking I'm not living up to mine!

But, Daddy, it is a hard bargain. It is, really. I'm so awfully lonely. You are the only person I have to care for, and you are so shadowy. You're just an imaginary man that I've made up—and probably the real you isn't a bit like my imaginary you. But you did once, when I was ill in the infirmary, send me a message, and now, when I am feeling awfully forgotten, I get out your card and read it over.

I don't think I am telling you at all what I started to say, which was this：

Although my feelings are still hurt, for it is very humiliating to be picked up and moved about by an arbitrary, peremptory, unreasonable, omnipotent, invisible providence, still, when a man has been as kind and generous and thoughtful as you have heretofore been toward me, I suppose he has a right to be an arbitrary, peremptory, unreasonable, invisible providence if he chooses, and so—I'll forgive you and be cheerful again. But I still don't enjoy getting Sallie's letters about the good times they are having in camp!

However—we will draw a veil over that and begin again.

I've been writing and writing this summer; four short stories finished and sent to four different magazines. So you see I'm trying to be an author. I have a workroom fixed in a corner of the attic where Master Jervie used to have his rainy-day playroom. It's in a cool, breezy corner with two dormer windows, and shaded by a maple tree with a family of red squirrels living in a hole.

I'll write a nicer letter in a few days and tell you all the farm news.

We need rain.

Yours as ever,

Judy





August 10th

Mr. Daddy-Long-Legs,

Sir：I address you from the second crotch in the willow tree by the pool in the pasture. There's a frog croaking underneath, a locust singing overhead, and two little “devil down-heads” darting up and down the trunk. I've been here for an hour; it's a very comfortable crotch, especially after being upholstered with two sofa cushions. I came up with a pen and tablet hoping to write an immortal short story, but I've been having a dreadful time with my heroine—I can't make her behave as I want her to behave; so I've abandoned her for the moment, and am writing to you. (Not much relief though, for I can't make you behave as I want you to, either.)

If you are in that dreadful New York, I wish I could send you some of this lovely, breezy, sunshiny outlook. The country is heaven after a week of rain.

Speaking of heaven—do you remember Mr. Kellogg that I told you about last summer?—the minister of the little white church at the Corners. Well, the poor old soul is dead—last winter of pneumonia. I went half a dozen times to hear him preach and got very well acquainted with his theology. He believed to the end exactly the same things he started with. It seems to me that a man who can think straight along for forty-seven years without changing a single idea ought to be kept in a cabinet as a curiosity. I hope he is enjoying his harp and golden crown; he was so perfectly sure of finding them! There's a new young man, very up and coming, in his place. The congregation is pretty dubious, especially the faction led by Deacon Cummings. It looks as though there was going to be an awful split in the church. We don't care for innovations in religion in this neighborhood.

During our week of rain I sat up in the attic and had an orgy of reading—Stevenson, mostly. He himself is more entertaining than any of the characters in his books; I dare say he made himself into the kind of hero that would look well in print. Don't you think it was perfect of him to spend all the ten thousand dollars his father left for a yacht and go sailing off to the South Seas? He lived up to his adventurous creed. If my father had left me ten thousand dollars, I'd do it, too. The thought of Vailima makes me wild. I want to see the tropics. I want to see the whole world. I am going to some day—I am, really, Daddy, when I get to be a great author, or artist, or actress, or playwright—or whatever sort of a great person I turn out to be. I have a terrible wanderthirst; the very sight of a map makes me want to put on my hat and take an umbrella and start. “I shall see before I die the palms and temples of the South.”





Thursday evening at twilight, sitting on the doorstep

Very hard to get any news into this letter! Judy is becoming so philosophical of late that she wishes to discourse largely of the world in general, instead of descending to the trivial details of daily life. But if you must have news, here it is：

Our nine young pigs waded across the brook and ran away last Tuesday, and only eight came back. We don't want to accuse any one unjustly, but we suspect that Widow Dowd has one more than she ought to have.



Mr. Weaver has painted his barn and his two silos a bright pumpkin yellow—a very ugly color, but he says it will wear.

The Brewers have company this week; Mrs. Brewer's sister and two nieces from Ohio.

One of our Rhode Island Reds only brought off three chicks out of fifteen eggs. We can't imagine what was the trouble. Rhode Island Reds, in my opinion, are a very inferior breed. I prefer Buff Orpingtons.



The new clerk in the post office at Bonnyrigg Four Corners drank every drop of Jamaica ginger they had in stock—seven dollars' worth—before he was discovered.

Old Ira Hatch has rheumatism and can't work any more; he never saved his money when he was earning good wages, so now he has to live on the town.

There's to be an ice cream social at the school-house next Saturday evening. Come and bring your families.

I have a new hat that I bought for twenty-five cents at the post office. This is my latest portrait, on my way to rake the hay.

It's getting too dark to see; anyway, the news is all used up.



Good night,

Judy





Friday

Good morning! Here is some news! What do you think? You'd never, never, never guess who's coming to Lock Willow. A letter to Mrs. Semple from Mr. Pendleton. He's motoring through the Berkshires, and is tired and wants to rest on a nice quiet farm—if he climbs out at her doorstep some night will she have a room ready for him? Maybe he'll stay one week, or maybe two, or maybe three; he'll see how restful it is when he gets here.

Such a flutter as we are in! The whole house is being cleaned and all the curtains washed. I am driving to the Corners this morning to get some new oil cloth for the entry, and two cans of brown floor paint for the hall and back stairs. Mrs. Dowd is engaged to come tomorrow to wash the windows (in the exigency of the moment, we waive our suspicions in regard to the piglet). You might think, from this account of our activities, that the house was not already immaculate; but I assure you it was! Whatever Mrs. Semple's limitations, she is a HOUSEKEEPER.

But isn't it just like a man, Daddy? He doesn't give the remotest hint as to whether he will land on the doorstep today, or two weeks from today. We shall live in a perpetual breathlessness until he comes—and if he doesn't hurry, the cleaning may all have to be done over again.

There's Amasai waiting below with the buckboard and Grover. I drive alone—but if you could see old Grove, you wouldn't be worried as to my safety.

Old Grove is perfectly safe.



With my hand on my heart—farewell.

Judy

P. S. Isn't that a nice ending? I got it out of Stevenson's letters.





Saturday

Good morning again! I didn't get this enveloped yesterday before the postman came, so I'll add some more. We have one mail a day at twelve o'clock. Rural delivery is a blessing to the farmers! Our postman not only delivers letters, but he runs errands for us in town, at five cents an errand. Yesterday he brought me some shoestrings and a jar of cold cream (I sunburned all the skin off my nose before I got my new hat) and a blue Windsor tie and a bottle of blacking all for ten cents. That was an unusual bargain, owing to the largeness of my order.

Also he tells us what is happening in the great world. Several people on the route take daily papers, and he reads them as he jogs along, and repeats the news to the ones who don't subscribe. So in case a war breaks out between the United States and Japan, or the president is assassinated, or Mr. Rockefeller leaves a million dollars to the John Grier Home, you needn't bother to write; I'll hear it anyway.

No sign yet of Master Jervie. But you should see how clean our house is—and with what anxiety we wipe our feet before we step in!

I hope he'll come soon; I am longing for some one to talk to. Mrs. Semple, to tell you the truth, gets sort of monotonous. She never lets ideas interrupt the easy flow of her conversation. It's a funny thing about the people here. Their world is just this single hilltop. They are not a bit universal, if you know what I mean. It's exactly the same as at the John Grier Home. Our ideas there were bounded by the four sides of the iron fence, only I didn't mind it so much because I was younger and was so awfully busy. By the time I'd got all my beds made and my babies' faces washed and had gone to school and come home and had washed their faces again and darned their stockings and mended Freddie Perkins's trousers (he tore them every day of his life) and learned my lessons in between—I was ready to go to bed, and I didn't notice any lack of social intercourse. But after two years in a conversational college, I do miss it; and I shall be glad to see somebody who speaks my language.

I really believe I've finished, Daddy. Nothing else occurs to me at the moment—I'll try to write a longer letter next time.

Yours always,

Judy

P. S. The lettuce hasn't done at all well this year. It was so dry early in the season.





August 25th

Well, Daddy, Master Jervie's here. And such a nice time as we're having! At least I am, and I think he is too—he has been here ten days and he doesn't show any signs of going. The way Mrs. Semple pampers that man is scandalous. If she indulged him as much when he was a baby, I don't know how he ever turned out so well.

He and I eat at a little table set on the side porch, or sometimes under the trees, or—when it rains or is cold—in the best parlor. He just picks out the spot he wants to eat in and Carrie trots after him with the table. Then if it has been an awful nuisance, and she has had to carry the dishes very far, she finds a dollar under the sugar bowl.

He is an awfully companionable sort of man, though you would never believe it to see him casually; he looks at first glance like a true Pendleton, but he isn't in the least. He is just as simple and unaffected and sweet as he can be—that seems a funny way to describe a man, but it's true. He's extremely nice with the farmers around here; he meets them in a sort of man-to-man fashion that disarms them immediately. They were very suspicious at first.They didn't care for his clothes! And I will say that his clothes are rather amazing. He wears knickerbockers and pleated jackets and white flannels and riding clothes with puffed trousers. Whenever he comes down in anything new, Mrs. Semple, beaming with pride, walks around and views him from every angle, and urges him to be careful where he sits down; she is so afraid he will pick up some dust. It bores him dreadfully. He's always saying to her：

“Run along, Lizzie, and tend to your work. You can't boss me any longer. I've grown up.”

It's awfully funny to think of that great, big, long-legged man (he's nearly as long-legged as you, Daddy) ever sitting in Mrs. Semple's lap and having his face washed. Particularly funny when you see her lap! She has two laps now, and three chins. But he says that once she was thin and wiry and spry and could run faster than he.

Such a lot of adventures we're having! We've explored the country for miles, and I've learned to fish with funny little flies made of feathers. Also to shoot with a rifle and a revolver. Also to ride horseback—there's an astonishing amount of life in old Grove. We fed him on oats for three days, and he shied at a calf and almost ran away with me.





Wednesday

We climbed Sky Hill Monday afternoon. That's a mountain near here; not an awfully high mountain, perhaps—no snow on the summit—but at least you are pretty breathless when you reach the top. The lower slopes are covered with woods, but the top is just piled rocks and open moor. We stayed up for the sunset and built a fire and cooked our supper. Master Jervie did the cooking; he said he knew how better than me—and he did, too, because he's used to camping. Then we came down by moonlight, and, when we reached the wood trail where it was dark, by the light of a flash light that he had in his pocket. It was such fun! He laughed and joked all the way and talked about interesting things. He's read all the books I've ever read, and a lot of others besides. It's astonishing how many different things he knows.

We went for a long tramp this morning and got caught in a storm. Our clothes were drenched before we reached home—but our spirits not even damp. You should have seen Mrs. Semple's face when we dripped into her kitchen.

“Oh, Master Jervie—Miss Judy! You are soaked through. Dear! Dear! What shall I do? That nice new coat is perfectly ruined.”

She was awfully funny; you would have thought that we were ten years old, and she a distracted mother. I was afraid for a while that we weren't going to get any jam for tea.





Saturday

I started this letter ages ago, but I haven't had a second to finish it. Isn't this a nice thought from Stevenson?

The world is so full of a number of things,

I am sure we should all be as happy as kings.

It's true, you know. The world is full of happiness, and plenty to go round, if you are only willing to take the kind that comes your way. The whole secret is in being pliable. In the country, especially, there are such a lot of entertaining things. I can walk over everybody's land, and look at everybody's view, and dabble in everybody's brook; and enjoy it just as much as though I owned the land—and with no taxes to pay!




It's Sunday night now, about eleven o'clock, and I am supposed to be getting some beauty sleep, but I had black coffee for dinner, so—no beauty sleep for me!

This morning, said Mrs. Semple to Mr. Pendleton, with a very determined accent：

“We have to leave here at a quarter past ten in order to get to church by eleven.”

“Very well, Lizzie,” said Master Jervie, “you have the surrey ready, and if I'm not dressed, just go on without waiting.”

“We'll wait,” said she.

“As you please,” said he, “only don't keep the horses standing too long.”

Then while she was dressing, he told Carrie to pack up a lunch, and he told me to scramble into my walking clothes; and we slipped out the back way and went fishing.

It discommoded the household dreadfully, because Lock Willow of a Sunday dines at two. But he ordered dinner at seven—he orders meals whenever he chooses; you would think the place were a restaurant—and that kept Carrie and Amasai from going driving. But he said it was all the better because it wasn't proper for them to go driving without a chaperon; and anyway, he wanted the horses himself to take me driving. Did you ever hear anything so funny?

And poor Mrs. Semple believes that people who go fishing on Sundays go afterwards to a sizzling hot hell! She is awfully troubled to think that she didn't train him better when he was small and helpless and she had the chance. Besides—she wished to show him off in church.

Anyway, we had our fishing (he caught four little ones) and we cooked them on a campfire for lunch. They kept falling off our spiked sticks into the fire, so they tasted a little ashy, but we ate them. We got home at four and went driving at five and had dinner at seven, and at ten I was sent to bed—and here I am, writing to you.

I am getting a little sleepy though.

Good night.

Here is a picture of the one fish I caught.





Ship ahoy, Cap'n Long-Legs!

Avast! Belay! Yo, ho, ho, and a bottle of rum. Guess what I'm reading? Our conversation these past two days has been nautical and piratical. Isn't Treasure Island fun? Did you ever read it, or wasn't it written when you were a boy? Stevenson only got thirty pounds for the serial rights—I don't believe it pays to be a great author. Maybe I'll teach school.

Excuse me for filling my letters so full of Stevenson; my mind is very much engaged with him at present. He comprises Lock Willow's library.

I've been writing this letter for two weeks, and I think it's about long enough. Never say, Daddy, that I don't give details. I wish you were here, too; we'd all have such a jolly time together. I like my different friends to know each other. I wanted to ask Mr. Pendleton if he knew you in New York—I should think he might; you must move in about the same exalted social circles, and you are both interested in reforms and things—but I couldn't, for I don't know your real name.

It's the silliest thing I ever heard of, not to know your name. Mrs. Lippett warned me that you were eccentric. I should think so!

Affectionately,

Judy

P. S. On reading this over, I find that it isn't all Stevenson. There are one or two glancing references to Master Jervie.





September 10th

Dear Daddy,

He has gone, and we are missing him! When you get accustomed to people or places or ways of living, and then have them suddenly snatched away, it does leave an awfully empty, gnawing sort of sensation. I'm finding Mrs. Semple's conversation pretty unseasoned food.

College opens in two weeks and I shall be glad to begin work again. I have worked quite a lot this summer though—six short stories and seven poems. Those I sent to the magazines all came back with the most courteous promptitude. But I don't mind. It's good practice. Master Jervie read them—he brought in the mail, so I couldn't help his knowing—and he said they were dreadful. They showed that I didn't have the slightest idea of what I was talking about. (Master Jervie doesn't let politeness interfere with truth.) But the last one I did—just a little sketch laid in college—he said wasn't bad; and he had it typewritten, and I sent it to a magazine. They've had it two weeks; maybe they're thinking it over.

You should see the sky! There's the queerest orange-colored light over everything. We're going to have a storm.




It commenced just that moment with drops as big as quarters and all the shutters banging. I had to run to close windows, while Carrie flew to the attic with an armful of milk pans to put under the places where the roof leaks—and then, just as I was resuming my pen, I remembered that I'd left a cushion and rug and hat and Matthew Arnold's poems under a tree in the orchard, so I dashed out to get them, all quite soaked. The red cover of the poems had run into the inside; “Dover Beach” in the future will be washed by pink waves.

A storm is awfully disturbing in the country. You are always having to think of so many things that are out of doors and getting spoiled.

Thursday

Daddy! Daddy! What do you think? The postman has just come with two letters.

1st—My story is accepted. $50.

Alors! I'm an AUTHOR.

2nd—A letter from the college secretary. I'm to have a scholarship for two years that will cover board and tuition. It was founded by an alumna for “marked proficiency in English with general excellency in other lines.” And I've won it! I applied for it before I left, but I didn't have an idea I'd get it, on account of my freshman bad work in math and Latin. But it seems I've made it up. I am awfully glad, Daddy, because now I won't be such a burden to you. The monthly allowance will be all I'll need, and maybe I can earn that with writing or tutoring or something.




I'm crazy to go back and begin work.

Yours ever,

September 26th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Back at college again and an upper classman. Our study is better than ever this year—faces the south with two huge windows—and oh! so furnished. Julia, with an unlimited allowance, arrived two days early and was attacked with a fever of settling.

We have new wall paper and Oriental rugs and mahogany chairs—not painted mahogany which made us sufficiently happy last year, but real. It's very gorgeous, but I don't feel as though I belonged in it; I'm nervous all the time for fear I'll get an ink spot in the wrong place.

And, Daddy, I found your letter waiting for me—pardon—I mean your secretary's.

Will you kindly convey to me a comprehensible reason why I should not accept that scholarship? I don't understand your objection in the least. But anyway, it won't do the slightest good for you to object, for I've already accepted it—and I am not going to change! That sounds a little impertinent, but I don't mean it so.

I suppose you feel that when you set out to educate me, you'd like to finish the work, and put a neat period, in the shape of a diploma, at the end.

But look at it just a second from my point of view. I shall owe my education to you just as much as though I let you pay for the whole of it, but I won't be quite so much indebted. I know that you don't want me to return the money, but nevertheless, I am going to want to do it, if I possibly can; and winning this scholarship makes it so much easier. I was expecting to spend the rest of my life in paying my debts, but now I shall only have to spend one-half of the rest of it.

I hope you understand my position and won't be cross. The allowance I shall still most gratefully accept. It requires an allowance to live up to Julia and her furniture! I wish that she had been reared to simpler tastes, or else that she were not my roommate.

This isn't much of a letter; I meant to have written a lot—but I've been hemming four window curtains and three portieres (I'm glad you can't see the length of the stitches) and polishing a brass desk set with tooth powder (very uphill work) and sawing off picture wire with manicure scissors, and unpacking four boxes of books, and putting away two trunkfuls of clothes (it doesn't seem believable that Jerusha Abbott owns two trunks full of clothes, but she does!) and welcoming back fifty dear friends in between.

Opening day is a joyous occasion!

Good night, Daddy dear, and don't be annoyed because your chick is wanting to scratch for herself. She's growing up into an awfully energetic little hen—with a very determined cluck and lots of beautiful feathers (all due to you).

Affectionately,

Judy





September 30th

Dear Daddy,

Are you still harping on that scholarship? I never knew a man so obstinate and stubborn and unreasonable, and tenacious, and bulldoggish, and unable-to-see-other-people's-points-of-view as you.

You prefer that I should not be accepting favors from strangers.

Strangers!—And what are you, pray?

Is there any one in the world that I know less? I shouldn't recognize you if I met you on the street. Now, you see, if you had been a sane, sensible person and had written nice, cheering, fatherly letters to your little Judy, and had come occasionally and patted her on the head, and had said you were glad she was such a good girl—then, perhaps, she wouldn't have flouted you in your old age, but would have obeyed your slightest wish like the dutiful daughter she was meant to be.

Strangers indeed! You live in a glass house, Mr. Smith.

And besides, this isn't a favor; it's like a prize—I earned it by hard work. If nobody had been good enough in English, the committee wouldn't have awarded the scholarship; some years they don't. Also—But what's the use of arguing with a man? You belong, Mr. Smith, to a sex devoid of a sense of logic. To bring a man into line there are just two methods：one must either coax or be disagreeable. I scorn to coax men for what I wish. Therefore, I must be disagreeable.

I refuse, sir, to give up the scholarship; and if you make any more fuss, I won't accept the monthly allowance either, but will wear myself into a nervous wreck tutoring stupid freshmen.

That is my ultimatum!

And listen—I have a further thought. Since you are so afraid that by taking this scholarship, I am depriving some one else of an education, I know a way out. You can apply the money that you would have spent for me, toward educating some other little girl from the John Grier Home. Don't you think that's a nice idea? Only, Daddy, educate the new girl as much as you choose, but please don't like her any better than me.

I trust that your secretary won't be hurt because I pay so little attention to the suggestions offered in his letter, but I can't help it if he is. He's a spoiled child, Daddy. I've meekly given in to his whims heretofore, but this time I intend to be FIRM.

Yours,

With a mind completely and irrevocably

and world-without-end

made-up.

November 9th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I started down town today to buy a bottle of shoe blacking and some collars and the material for a new blouse and a jar of violet cream and a cake of castile soap—all very necessary; I couldn't be happy another day without them—and when I tried to pay the car fare, I found that I had left my purse in the pocket of my other coat. So I had to get out and take the next car, and was late for gymnasium.

It's a dreadful thing to have no memory and two coats!

Julia Pendleton has invited me to visit her for the Christmas holidays. How does that strike you, Mr. Smith? Fancy Jerusha Abbott, of the John Grier Home, sitting at the tables of the rich. I don't know why Julia wants me—she seems to be getting quite attached to me of late. I should, to tell the truth, very much prefer going to Sallie's, but Julia asked me first, so if I go anywhere, it must be to New York instead of to Worcester. I'm rather awed at the prospect of meeting Pendletons en masse, and also I'd have to get a lot of new clothes—so, Daddy dear, if you write that you would prefer having me remain quietly at college, I will bow to your wishes with my usual sweet docility.

I'm engaged at odd moments with the Life and Letters of Thomas Huxley—it makes nice, light reading to pick up between times. Do you know what an archaeopteryx is? It's a bird. And a stereognathus? I'm not sure myself, but I think it's a missing link, like a bird with teeth or a lizard with wings. No, it isn't either; I've just looked in the book. It's a mesozoic mammal.

This is the only picture extant of a stereognathus.



I've elected economics this year—very illuminating subject. When I finish that I'm going to take Charity and Reform; then, Mr. Trustee, I'll know just how an orphan asylum ought to be run. Don't you think I'd make an admirable voter if I had my rights? I was twenty-one last week. This is an awfully wasteful country to throw away such an honest, educated, conscientious, intelligent citizen as I would be.

Yours always,

Judy





December 7th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Thank you for permission to visit Julia—I take it that silence means consent.

Such a social whirl as we've been having! The founder's dance came last week—this was the first year that any of us could attend, only upper-classmen being allowed.

I invited Jimmie McBride, and Sallie invited his roommate at Princeton, who visited them last summer at their camp—an awfully nice man with red hair—and Julia invited a man from New York, not very exciting, but socially irreproachable. He is connected with the De la Mater Chichesters. Perhaps that means something to you? It doesn't illuminate me to any extent.

However—our guests came Friday afternoon in time for tea in the senior corridor, and then dashed down to the hotel for dinner. The hotel was so full that they slept in rows on the billiard tables, they say. Jimmie McBride says that the next time he is bidden to a social event in this college, he is going to bring one of their Adirondack tents and pitch it on the campus.

At seven thirty they came back for the President's reception and dance. Our functions commence early! We had the men's cards all made out ahead of time, and after every dance, we'd leave them in groups under the letter that stood for their names, so that they could be readily found by their next partners. Jimmie McBride, for example, would stand patiently under M until he was claimed. (At least, he ought to have stood patiently, but he kept wandering off and getting mixed with R's and S's and all sorts of letters.) I found him a very difficult guest; he was sulky because he had only three dances with me. He said he was bashful about dancing with girls he didn't know!

The next morning we had a glee club concert—and who do you think wrote the funny new song composed for the occasion? It's the truth. She did. Oh, I tell you, Daddy, your little foundling is getting to be quite a prominent person!

Anyway, our gay two days were great fun, and I think the men enjoyed it. Some of them were awfully perturbed at first at the prospect of facing one thousand girls; but they got acclimated very quickly. Our two Princeton men had a beautiful time—at least they politely said they had, and they've invited us to their dance next spring. We've accepted, so please don't object, Daddy dear.

Julia and Sallie and I all had new dresses. Do you want to hear about them? Julia's was cream satin and gold embroidery, and she wore purple orchids. It was a dream and came from Paris, and cost a million dollars.

Sallie's was pale blue trimmed with Persian embroidery, and went beautifully with red hair. It didn't cost quite a million, but was just as effective as Julia's.

Mine was pale pink crepe de chine trimmed with ecru lace and rose satin. And I carried crimson roses which J. McB. sent (Sallie having told him what color to get). And we all had satin slippers and silk stockings and chiffon scarfs to match.

You must be deeply impressed by these millinery details!

One can't help thinking, Daddy, what a colorless life a man is forced to lead, when one reflects that chiffon and venetian point and hand embroidery and Irish crochet are to him mere empty words. Whereas a woman whether she is interested in babies or microbes or husbands or poetry or servants or parallelograms or gardens or Plato or bridge—is fundamentally and always interested in clothes.

It's the one touch of nature that makes the whole world kin. (That isn't original. I got it out of one of Shakespeare's plays.)

However, to resume. Do you want me to tell you a secret that I've lately discovered? And will you promise not to think me vain? Then listen：

I'm pretty.

I am, really. I'd be an awful idiot not to know it with three looking-glasses in the room.

A Friend

P. S. This is one of those wicked anonymous letters you read about in novels.





December 20th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I've just a moment, because I must attend two classes, pack a trunk and a suitcase, and catch the four-o'clock train—but I couldn't go without sending a word to let you know how much I appreciate my Christmas box.

I love the furs and the necklace and the liberty scarf and the gloves and handkerchiefs and books and purse—and most of all I love you! But Daddy, you have no business to spoil me this way. I'm only human—and a girl at that. How can I keep my mind sternly fixed on a studious career, when you deflect me with such worldly frivolities?

I have strong suspicions now as to which one of the John Grier Trustees used to give the Christmas tree and the Sunday ice cream. He was nameless, but by his works I know him! You deserve to be happy for all the good things you do.

Good-bye, and a very merry Christmas.

Yours always,

Judy

P. S. I am sending a slight token, too. Do you think you would like her if you knew her?





January 11th

I meant to write to you from the city, Daddy, but New York is an engrossing place.

I had an interesting—and illuminating—time, but I'm glad I don't belong in such a family! I should truly rather have the John Grier Home for a background. Whatever the drawbacks of my bringing up, there was at least no pretense about it. I know now what people mean when they say they are weighed down by things. The material atmosphere of that house was crushing; I didn't draw a deep breath until I was on an express train coming back. All the furniture was carved and upholstered and gorgeous; the people I met were beautifully dressed and low-voiced and well-bred, but it's the truth, Daddy, I never heard one word of real talk from the time we arrived until we left. I don't think an idea ever entered the front door.

Mrs. Pendleton never thinks of anything but jewels and dressmakers and social engagements. She did seem a different kind of mother from Mrs. McBride! If I ever marry and have a family, I'm going to make them as exactly like the McBrides as I can. Not for all the money in the world would I ever let any children of mine develop into Pendletons. Maybe it isn't polite to criticize people you've been visiting? If it isn't, please excuse. This is very confidential, between you and me.

I only saw Master Jervie once when he called at tea time, and then I didn't have a chance to speak to him alone. It was sort of disappointing after our nice time last summer. I don't think he cares much for his relatives—and I am sure they don't care much for him! Julia's mother says he's unbalanced. He's a socialist—except, thank heaven, he doesn't let his hair grow and wear red ties. She can't imagine where he picked up his queer ideas; the family have been Church of England for generations. He throws away his money on every sort of crazy reform, instead of spending it on such sensible things as yachts and automobiles and polo ponies. He does buy candy with it though! He sent Julia and me each a box for Christmas.

You know, I think I'll be a socialist, too. You wouldn't mind, would you, Daddy? They're quite different from anarchists; they don't believe in blowing people up. Probably I am one by rights; I belong to the proletariat. I haven't determined yet just which kind I am going to be. I will look into the subject over Sunday, and declare my principles in my next.

I've seen loads of theaters and hotels and beautiful houses. My mind is a confused jumble of onyx and gilding and mosaic floors and palms. I'm still pretty breathless but I am glad to get back to college and my books—I believe that I really am a student; this atmosphere of academic calm I find more bracing than New York. College is a very satisfying sort of life; the books and study and regular classes keep you alive mentally, and then when your mind gets tired, you have the gymnasium and outdoor athletics, and always plenty of congenial friends who are thinking about the same things you are. We spend a whole evening in nothing but talk—talk—talk—and go to bed with a very uplifted feeling, as though we had settled permanently some pressing world problems. And filling in every crevice, there is always such a lot of nonsense—just silly jokes about the little things that come up—but very satisfying. We do appreciate our own witticisms!

It isn't the great big pleasures that count the most; it's making a great deal out of the little ones—I've discovered the true secret of happiness, Daddy, and that is to live in the now. Not to be forever regretting the past, or anticipating the future; but to get the most that you can out of this very instant. It's like farming. You can have extensive farming and intensive farming; well, I am going to have intensive living after this. I'm going to enjoy every second, and I'm going to know I'm enjoying it while I'm enjoying it. Most people don't live; they just race. They are trying to reach some goal far away on the horizon, and in the heat of the going they get so breathless and panting that they lose all sight of the beautiful, tranquil country they are passing through; and then the first thing they know, they are old and worn out, and it doesn't make any difference whether they've reached the goal or not. I've decided to sit down by the way and pile up a lot of little happinesses, even if I never become a great author. Did you ever know such a philosopheress as I am developing into?

Yours ever,

Judy

P. S. It's raining cats and dogs tonight. Two puppies and a kitten have just landed on the window sill.





Dear Comrade,

Hooray! I'm a Fabian.

That's a socialist who's willing to wait. We don't want the social revolution to come tomorrow morning; it would be too upsetting. We want it to come very gradually in the distant future, when we shall all be prepared and able to sustain the shock.

In the meantime we must be getting ready, by instituting industrial, educational, and orphan asylum reforms.

Yours, with fraternal love,

Judy

Monday, 3rd hour





February 11th

Dear D. L. L.,

Don't be insulted because this is so short. It isn't a letter; it's just a line to say that I'm going to write a letter pretty soon when examinations are over. It is not only necessary that I pass, but pass WELL. I have a scholarship to live up to.

Yours, studying hard,

J. A.





March 5th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

President Cuyler made a speech this evening about the modern generation being flippant and superficial. He says that we are losing the old ideals of earnest endeavor and true scholarship; and particularly is this falling off noticeable in our disrespectful attitude toward organized authority. We no longer pay a seemly deference to our superiors.

I came away from chapel very sober.

Am I too familiar, Daddy? Ought I to treat you with more dignity and aloofness?—Yes, I'm sure I ought. I'll begin again.

My dear Mr. smith,

You will be pleased to hear that I passed successfully my midyear examinations, and am now commencing work in the new semester. I am leaving chemistry—having completed the course in qualitative analysis—and am entering upon the study of biology. I approach this subject with some hesitation, as I understand that we dissect angleworms and frogs.

An extremely interesting and valuable lecture was given in the chapel last week upon Roman Remains in Southern France. I have never listened to a more illuminating exposition of the subject.

We are reading Wordsworth's Tinturn Abbey in connection with our course in English Literature. What an exquisite work it is, and how adequately it embodies his conception of Pantheism! The Romantic movement of the early part of the last century, exemplified in the works of such poets as Shelley, Byron, Keats, and Wordsworth, appeals to me very much more than the Classical period that preceded it. Speaking of poetry, have you ever read that charming little thing of Tennyson's called “Locksley Hall”?

I am attending gymnasium very regularly of late. A proctor system has been devised, and failure to comply with the rules causes a great deal of inconvenience. The gymnasium is equipped with a very beautiful swimming tank of cement and marble, the gift of a former graduate. My roommate, Miss McBride, has given me her bathing suit (it shrank so that she can no longer wear it) and I am about to begin swimming lessons.

We had delicious pink ice cream for dessert last night. Only vegetable dyes are used in coloring the food. The college is very much opposed, both from esthetic and hygienic motives, to the use of aniline dyes.

The weather of late has been ideal—bright sunshine and clouds interspersed with a few welcome snowstorms. I and my companions have enjoyed our walks to and from classes—particularly from.

Trusting, my dear Mr. Smith, that this will find you in your usual good health.

I remain,

Most cordially yours,

Jerusha Abbott





April 24th

Dear Daddy,

Spring has come again! You should see how lovely the campus is. I think you might come and look at it for yourself. Master Jervie dropped in again last Friday—but he chose a most unpropitious time, for Sallie and Julia and I were just running to catch a train. And where do you think we were going? To Princeton, to attend a dance and a ball game, if you please! I didn't ask you if I might go, because I had a feeling that your secretary would say no. But it was entirely regular; we had leave of absence from college, and Mrs. McBride chaperoned us. We had a charming time—but I shall have to omit details; they are too many and complicated.





Saturday

Up before dawn! The night watchman called us—six of us—and we made coffee in a chafing dish (you never saw so many grounds!) and walked two miles to the top of One Tree Hill to see the sun rise. We had to scramble up the last slope! The sun almost beat us! And perhaps you think we didn't bring back appetites to breakfast!

Dear me, Daddy, I seem to have a very ejaculatory style today; this page is peppered with exclamations.



I meant to have written a lot about the budding trees and the new cinder path in the athletic field, and the awful lesson we have in biology for tomorrow, and the new canoes on the lake, and Catherine Prentiss who has pneumonia, and Prexy's Angora kitten that strayed from home and has been boarding in Fergussen Hall for two weeks until a chambermaid reported it, and about my three new dresses—white and pink and blue polka dots with a hat to match—but I am too sleepy. I am always making this an excuse, am I not? But a girl's college is a busy place and we do get tired by the end of the day! Particularly when the day begins at dawn.

This is Prexy's kitten.You can see from the picture how Angora he is.



Affectionately,

Judy





May 15th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Is it good manners when you get into a car just to stare straight ahead and not see anybody else?

A very beautiful lady in a very beautiful velvet dress got into the car today, and without the slightest expression sat for fifteen minutes and looked at a sign advertising suspenders. It doesn't seem polite to ignore everybody else as though you were the only important person present. Anyway, you miss a lot. While she was absorbing that silly sign, I was studying a whole car full of interesting human beings.

The accompanying illustration is hereby reproduced for the first time. It looks like a spider on the end of a string, but it isn't at all; it's a picture of me learning to swim in the tank in the gymnasium.



The instructor hooks a rope into a ring in the back of my belt, and runs it through a pulley in the ceiling. It would be a beautiful system if one had perfect confidence in the probity of one's instructor. I'm always afraid, though, that she will let the rope get slack, so I keep one anxious eye on her and swim with the other, and with this divided interest I do not make the progress that I otherwise might.

Very miscellaneous weather we're having of late. It was raining when I commenced and now the sun is shining. Sallie and I are going out to play tennis—thereby gaining exemption from gym.

A week later

I should have finished this letter long ago, but I didn't. You don't mind, do you, Daddy, if I'm not very regular? I really do love to write to you; it gives me such a respectable feeling of having some family. Would you like me to tell you something? You are not the only man to whom I write letters. There are two others! I have been receiving beautiful long letters this winter from Master Jervie (with typewritten envelopes so Julia won't recognize the writing). Did you ever hear anything so shocking? And every week or so a very scrawly epistle, usually on yellow tablet paper, arrives from Princeton. All of which I answer with businesslike promptness. So you see, I am not so different from other girls—I get mail, too.

Did I tell you that I have been elected a member of the Senior Dramatic Club? Very recherché organization. Only seventy-five members out of one thousand. Do you think as a consistent socialist that I ought to belong?

What do you suppose is at present engaging my attention in sociology? I am writing (figurez vous!) a paper on the Care of Dependent Children. The professor shuffled up his subjects and dealt them out promiscuously, and that fell to me. C'est drôle ça n'est pas?

There goes the gong for dinner. I'll mail this as I pass the chute.

Affectionately,

J.





June 4th

Dear Daddy,

Very busy time—commencement in ten days, examinations tomorrow; lots of studying, lots of packing, and the outdoors world so lovely that it hurts you to stay inside.

But never mind, vacation's coming. Julia is going abroad this summer—it makes the fourth time. No doubt about it, Daddy, goods are not distributed evenly. Sallie, as usual, goes to the Adirondacks. And what do you think I am going to do? You may have three guesses. Lock Willow? Wrong. The Adirondacks with Sallie? Wrong. (I'll never attempt that again; I was discouraged last year.) Can't you guess anything else? You're not very inventive. I'll tell you, Daddy, if you'll promise not to make a lot of objections. I warn your secretary ahead of time that my mind is made up.

I am going to spend the summer at the seaside with a Mrs. Charles Paterson and tutor her daughter who is to enter college in the autumn. I met her through the McBrides, and she is a very charming woman. I am to give lessons in English and Latin to the younger daughter, too, but I shall have a little time to myself, and I shall be earning fifty dollars a month! Doesn't that impress you as a perfectly exorbitant amount? She offered it; I should have blushed to ask more than twenty-five.

I finish at Magnolia (that's where she lives) the first of September and shall probably spend the remaining three weeks at Lock Willow—I should like to see the Semples again and all the friendly animals.

How does my program strike you, Daddy? I am getting quite independent, you see. You have put me on my feet and I think I can almost walk alone by now.

Princeton commencement and our examinations exactly coincide—which is an awful blow. Sallie and I did so want to get away in time for it, but of course that is utterly impossible.

Good-bye, Daddy. Have a nice summer and come back in the autumn rested and ready for another year of work. (That's what you ought to be writing to me!) I haven't an idea what you do in the summer, or how you amuse yourself. I can't visualize your surroundings. Do you play golf or hunt or ride horseback or just sit in the sun and meditate?

Anyway, whatever it is, have a good time and don't forget Judy.





June 10th

Dear Daddy,

This is the hardest letter I ever wrote, but I have decided what I must do, and there isn't going to be any turning back. It is very sweet and generous and dear of you to wish to send me to Europe this summer—for the moment I was intoxicated by the idea; but sober second thoughts said no. It would be rather illogical of me to refuse to take your money for college, and then use it instead just for amusement! You mustn't get me used to too many luxuries. One doesn't miss what one has never had; but it is awfully hard going without things after one has commenced thinking they are his—hers (English language needs another pronoun) by natural right. Living with Sallie and Julia is an awful strain on my stoical philosophy. They have both had things from the time they were babies; they accept happiness as a matter of course. The world, they think, owes them everything they want. Maybe the world does—in any case, it seems to acknowledge the debt and pay up. But as for me, it owes me nothing and distinctly told me so in the beginning. I have no right to borrow on credit, for there will come a time when the world will repudiate my claim.

I seem to be floundering in a sea of metaphor—but I hope you grasp my meaning? Anyway, I have a very strong feeling that the only honest thing for me to do is to teach this summer and begin to support myself.





Magnolia,

Four days later

I'd got just that much written, when—what do you think happened? The maid arrived with Master Jervie's card. He is going abroad too this summer; not with Julia and her family but entirely by himself. I told him that you had invited me to go with a lady who is chaperoning a party of girls. He knows about you, Daddy. That is, he knows that my father and mother are dead, and that a kind gentleman is sending me to college; I simply didn't have the courage to tell him about the John Grier Home and all the rest. He thinks that you are my guardian and a perfectly legitimate old family friend. I have never told him that I didn't know you—that would seem too queer!

Anyway, he insisted on my going to Europe. He said that it was a necessary part of my education and that I mustn't think of refusing. Also, that he would be in Paris at the same time, and that we would run away from the chaperon occasionally and have dinner together at nice, funny, foreign restaurants.

Well, Daddy, it did appeal to me! I almost weakened; if he hadn't been so dictatorial, maybe I should have entirely weakened. I can be enticed step by step, but I won't be forced. He said I was a silly, foolish, irrational, quixotic, idiotic, stubborn child (those are a few of his abusive adjectives; the rest escape me) and that I didn't know what was good for me; I ought to let older people judge. We almost quarreled—I am not sure but that we entirely did!

In any case, I packed my trunk fast and came up here. I thought I'd better see my bridges in flames behind me before I finished writing to you. They are entirely reduced to ashes now. Here I am at Cliff Top (the name of Mrs. Paterson's cottage) with my trunk unpacked and Florence (the little one) already struggling with first declension nouns. And it bids fair to be a struggle! She is a most uncommonly spoiled child; I shall have to teach her first how to study—she has never in her life concentrated on anything more difficult than ice cream soda water.

We use a quiet corner of the cliffs for a schoolroom—Mrs. Paterson wishes me to keep them out of doors—and I will say that I find it difficult to concentrate with the blue sea before me and ships a-sailing by! And when I think I might be on one, sailing off to foreign lands—but I won't let myself think of anything but Latin Grammar.

The prepositions a or ab, absque, coram, cum, de, e or ex, prae, pro, sine, tenus, in, subter, sub and super govern the ablative.

So you see, Daddy, I am already plunged into work with my eyes persistently set against temptation. Don't be cross with me, please, and don't think that I do not appreciate your kindness, for I do—always—always. The only way I can ever repay you is by turning out a Very Useful Citizen (Are women citizens? I don't suppose they are). Anyway, a Very Useful Person. And when you look at me you can say, “I gave that Very Useful Person to the world.”

That sounds well, doesn't it, Daddy? But I don't wish to mislead you. The feeling often comes over me that I am not at all remarkable; it is fun to plan a career, but in all probability, I shan't turn out a bit different from any other ordinary person. I may end by marrying an undertaker and being an inspiration to him in his work.

Yours ever,

Judy





August 19th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

My window looks out on the loveliest landscape—ocean-scape rather—nothing but water and rocks.

The summer goes. I spend the morning with Latin and English and algebra and my two stupid girls. I don't know how Marion is ever going to get into college, or stay in after she gets there. And as for Florence, she is hopeless—but oh! such a little beauty. I don't suppose it matters in the least whether they are stupid or not so long as they are pretty. One can't help thinking though how their conversation will bore their husbands, unless they are fortunate enough to obtain stupid husbands. I suppose that's quite possible; the world seems to be filled with stupid men; I've met a number this summer.

In the afternoon we take a walk on the cliffs, or swim, if the tide is right. I can swim in salt water with the utmost ease—you see my education is already being put to use!

A letter comes from Mr. Jervis Pendleton in Paris, rather a short, concise letter; I'm not quite forgiven yet for refusing to follow his advice. However, if he gets back in time, he will see me for a few days at Lock Willow before college opens, and if I am very nice and sweet and docile, I shall (I am led to infer) be received into favor again.

Also a letter from Sallie. She wants me to come to their camp for two weeks in September. Must I ask your permission, or haven't I yet arrived at the place where I can do as I please? Yes, I am sure I have—I'm a senior, you know. Having worked all summer, I feel like taking a little healthful recreation; I want to see the Adirondacks; I want to see Sallie; I want to see Sallie's brother—he's going to teach me to canoe—and (we come to my chief motive, which is mean) I want Master Jervie to arrive at Lock Willow and find me not there.

I must show him that he can't dictate to me. No one can dictate to me but you, Daddy—and you can't always! I'm off for the woods.

Judy





Camp Mcbride,

September 6th

Dear Daddy,

Your letter didn't come in time (I am pleased to say). If you wish your instructions to be obeyed, you must have your secretary transmit them in less than two weeks. As you observe, I am here, and have been for five days.

The woods are fine, and so is the camp, and so is the weather, and so are the McBrides, and so is the whole world. I'm very happy!

There's Jimmie calling for me to come canoeing. Good-bye—sorry to have disobeyed, but why are you so persistent about not wanting me to play a little? When I've worked all summer I deserve two weeks. You are awfully dog-in-the-mangerish.

However—I love you still, Daddy, in spite of all your faults.

Judy





October 3rd

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Back at college and a Senior—also editor of the Monthly. It doesn't seem possible, does it, that so sophisticated a person, just four years ago, was an inmate of the John Grier Home? We do arrive fast in America!

What do you think of this? A note from Master Jervie directed to Lock Willow and forwarded here. He's sorry but he finds that he can't get up there this autumn; he has accepted an invitation to go yachting with some friends. Hopes I've had a nice summer and am enjoying the country.

And he knew all the time that I was with the McBrides, for Julia told him so! You men ought to leave intrigue to women; you haven't a light enough touch. Julia has a trunkful of the most ravishing new clothes—an evening gown of rainbow Liberty crepe that would be fitting raiment for the angels in paradise. And I thought that my own clothes this year were unprecedentedly (is there such a word?) beautiful. I copied Mrs. Paterson's wardrobe with the aid of a cheap dressmaker, and though the gowns didn't turn out quite twins of the originals, I was entirely happy until Julia unpacked. But now—I live to see Paris!

Dear Daddy, aren't you glad you're not a girl? I suppose you think that the fuss we make over clothes is too absolutely silly? It is. No doubt about it. But it's entirely your fault.

Did you ever hear about the learned Herr Professor who regarded unnecessary adornment with contempt, and favored sensible, utilitarian clothes for women? His wife, who was an obliging creature, adopted “dress reform.” And what do you think he did? He eloped with a chorus girl.

Yours ever,

Judy

P. S. The chambermaid on our corridor wears blue checked gingham aprons. I am going to get her some brown ones instead, and sink the blue ones in the bottom of the lake. I have a reminiscent chill every time I look at them.





November 17th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Such a blight has fallen over my literary career. I don't know whether to tell you or not, but I would like some sympathy—silent sympathy, please; don't reopen the wound by referring to it in your next letter.

I've been writing a book, all last winter in the evenings, and all summer when I wasn't teaching Latin to my two stupid children. I just finished it before college opened and sent it to a publisher. He kept it two months, and I was certain he was going to take it; but yesterday morning an express parcel came (thirty cents due) and there it was back again with a letter from the publisher, a very nice, fatherly letter—but frank! He said he saw from the address that I was still in college, and if I would accept some advice, he would suggest that I put all of my energy into my lessons and wait until I graduated before beginning to write. He enclosed his reader's opinion. Here it is：

“Plot highly improbable. Characterization exaggerated. Conversation unnatural. A good deal of humor but not always in the best of taste. Tell her to keep on trying, and in time she may produce a real book.”

Not on the whole flattering, is it, Daddy? And I thought I was making a notable addition to American literature, I did truly. I was planning to surprise you by writing a great novel before I graduated. I collected the material for it while I was at Julia's last Christmas. But I dare say the editor is right. Probably two weeks was not enough in which to observe the manners and customs of a great city.

I took it walking with me yesterday afternoon, and when I came to the gas house, I went in and asked the engineer if I might borrow his furnace. He politely opened the door, and with my own hands I chucked it in. I felt as though I had cremated my only child!

I went to bed last night utterly dejected; I thought I was never going to amount to anything, and that you had thrown away your money for nothing. But what do you think? I woke up this morning with a beautiful new plot in my head, and I've been going about all day planning my characters, just as happy as I could be. No one can ever accuse me of being a pessimist! If I had a husband and twelve children swallowed by an earthquake one day, I'd bob up smilingly the next morning and commence to look for another set.

Affectionately,

Judy





December 14th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I dreamed the funniest dream last night. I thought I went into a book-store and the clerk brought me a new book named The Life and Letters of Judy Abbott. I could see it perfectly plainly—red cloth binding with a picture of the John Grier Home on the cover, and my portrait for a frontispiece with “Very truly yours, Judy Abbott” written below. But just as I was turning to the end to read the inscription on my tombstone, I woke up. It was very annoying! I almost found out who I'm going to marry and when I'm going to die.

Don't you think it would be interesting if you really could read the story of your life—written perfectly truthfully by an omniscient author? And suppose you could only read it on this condition：that you would never forget it, but would have to go through life knowing ahead of time exactly how everything you did would turn out, and foreseeing to the exact hour the time when you would die. How many people do you suppose would have the courage to read it then? Or how many could suppress their curiosity sufficiently to escape from reading it, even at the price of having to live without hope and without surprises?

Life is monotonous enough at best; you have to eat and sleep about so often. But imagine how deadly monotonous it would be if nothing unexpected could happen between meals. Mercy! Daddy, there's a blot, but I'm on the third page and I can't begin a new sheet.

I'm going on with biology again this year—very interesting subject; we're studying the alimentary system at present. You should see how sweet a cross section of the duodenum of a cat is under the microscope.

Also we've arrived at philosophy—interesting but evanescent. I prefer biology where you can pin the subject under discussion to a board. There's another! And another! This pen is weeping copiously. Please excuse its tears.

Do you believe in free will? I do—unreservedly. I don't agree at all with the philosophers who think that every action is the absolutely inevitable and automatic resultant of an aggregation of remote causes. That's the most immoral doctrine I ever heard—nobody would be to blame for anything. If a man believed in fatalism, he would naturally just sit down and say, “The Lord's will be done,” and continue to sit until he fell over dead.

I believe absolutely in my own free will and my own power to accomplish—and that is the belief that moves mountains. You watch me become a great author! I have four chapters of my new book finished and five more drafted.

This is a very abstruse letter—does your head ache, Daddy? I think we'll stop now and make some fudge. I'm sorry I can't send you a piece; it will be unusually good, for we're going to make it with real cream and three butter balls.

Yours affectionately,

Judy

P. S. We're having fancy dancing in gymnasium class. You can see by the accompanying picture how much we look like a real ballet. The one on the end accomplishing a graceful pirouette is me—I mean I.





December 26th

My dear, dear Daddy,

Haven't you any sense? Don't you know that you mustn't give one girl seventeen Christmas presents? I'm a socialist, please remember; do you wish to turn me into a plutocrat?

Think how embarrassing it would be if we should ever quarrel! I should have to engage a moving van to return your gifts.



I am sorry that the necktie I sent was so wobbly; I knit it with my own hands (as you doubtless discovered from internal evidence). You will have to wear it on cold days and keep your coat buttoned up tight.

Thank you, Daddy, a thousand times. I think you're the sweetest man that ever lived—and the foolishest!

Judy

Here's a four-leaf clover from Camp McBride to bring you good luck for the New Year.





January 9th

Do you wish to do something, Daddy, that will insure your eternal salvation? There is a family here who are in awfully desperate straits. A mother and father and four visible children—the two older boys have disappeared into the world to make their fortune and have not sent any of it back. The father worked in a glass factory and got consumption—it's awfully unhealthy work—and now has been sent away to a hospital. That took all of their savings, and the support of the family falls upon the oldest daughter who is twenty-four. She dressmakes for $1.50 a day (when she can get it) and embroiders centerpieces in the evening. The mother isn't very strong and is extremely ineffectual and pious. She sits with her hands folded, a picture of patient resignation, while the daughter kills herself with overwork and responsibility and worry; she doesn't see how they are going to get through the rest of the winter—and I don't either. One hundred dollars would buy some coal and some shoes for the three children so that they could go to school, and give a little margin so that she needn't worry herself to death when a few days pass and she doesn't get work.

You are the richest man I know. Don't you suppose you could spare one hundred dollars? That girl deserves help a lot more than I ever did. I wouldn't ask it except for the girl; I don't care much what happens to the mother—she is such a jellyfish.

The way people are forever rolling their eyes to heaven and saying, “Perhaps it's all for the best” when they are perfectly dead sure it's not, makes me enraged. Humility or resignation or whatever you choose to call it, is simply impotent inertia. I'm for a more militant religion!

We are getting the most dreadful lessons in philosophy—all of Schopenhauer for tomorrow. The professor doesn't seem to realize that we are taking any other subject. He's a queer old duck; he goes about with his head in the clouds and blinks dazedly when occasionally he strikes solid earth. He tries to lighten his lectures with an occasional witticism—and we do our best to smile, but I assure you his jokes are no laughing matter. He spends his entire time between classes in trying to figure out whether matter really exists or whether he only thinks it exists.

I'm sure my sewing girl hasn't any doubt but that it exists!

Where do you think my new novel is? In the waste basket. I can see myself that it's no good on earth, and when a loving author realizes that, what would be the judgment of a critical public?

Later

I address you, Daddy, from a bed of pain. For two days I've been laid up with swollen tonsils; I can just swallow hot milk, and that is all. “What were your parents thinking of not to have those tonsils out when you were a baby?” the doctor wished to know. I'm sure I haven't an idea, but I doubt if they were thinking much about me.

Yours,

J. A.

Next morning

I just read this over before sealing it. I don't know why I cast such a misty atmosphere over life. I hasten to assure you that I am young and happy and exuberant; and I trust you are the same. Youth has nothing to do with birthdays, only with alivedness of spirit, so even if your hair is gray, Daddy, you can still be a boy.

Affectionately,

Judy





Jan. 12th

Dear Mr. Philanthropist,

Your check for my family came yesterday. Thank you so much! I cut gymnasium and took it down to them right after luncheon, and you should have seen the girl's face! She was so surprised and happy and relieved that she looked almost young; and she's only twenty-four. Isn't it pitiful?

Anyway, she feels now as though all the good things were coming together. She has steady work ahead for two months—some one's getting married, and there's a trousseau to make.

“Thank the good Lord!” cried the mother, when she grasped the fact that that small piece of paper was one hundred dollars.

“It wasn't the good Lord at all,” said I, “it was Daddy-Long-Legs.” (Mr. Smith, I called you.)

“But it was the good Lord who put it in his mind,” said she.

“Not at all! I put it in his mind myself,” said I.

But anyway, Daddy, I trust the good Lord will reward you suitably. You deserve ten thousand years out of purgatory.

Yours most gratefully,

Judy Abbott





Feb. 15th

May it please Your Most excellent Majesty,

This morning I did eat my breakfast upon a cold turkey pie and a goose, and I did send for a cup of tee (a china drink) of which I had never drank before.

Don't be nervous, Daddy—I haven't lost my mind; I'm merely quoting Samuel Pepys. We're reading him in connection with English History, original sources. Sallie and Julia and I converse now in the language of 1660. Listen to this：

“I went to Charing Cross to see Major Harrison hanged, drawn and quartered：he looking as cheerful as any man could do in that condition.” And this：“Dined with my lady who is in handsome mourning for her brother who died yesterday of spotted fever.”

Seems a little early to commence entertaining, doesn't it? A friend of Pepys devised a very cunning manner whereby the king might pay his debts out of the sale to poor people of old decayed provisions. What do you, a reformer, think of that? I don't believe we're so bad today as the newspapers make out.

Samuel was as excited about his clothes as any girl; he spent five times as much on dress as his wife—that appears to have been the golden age of husbands. Isn't this a touching entry? You see he really was honest. “Today came home my fine Camlett cloak with gold buttons, which cost me much money, and I pray God to make me able to pay for it.”

Excuse me for being so full of Pepys; I'm writing a special topic on him.

What do you think, Daddy? The Self-Government Association has abolished the ten-o'clock rule. We can keep our lights all night if we choose, the only requirement being that we do not disturb others—we are not supposed to entertain on a large scale. The result is a beautiful commentary on human nature. Now that we may stay up as long as we choose, we no longer choose. Our heads begin to nod at nine o'clock, and by nine-thirty the pen drops from our nerveless grasp. It's nine-thirty now. Good night.





Sunday

Just back from church—preacher from Georgia. We must take care, he says, not to develop our intellects at the expense of our emotional natures—but methought it was a poor, dry sermon (Pepys again). It doesn't matter what part of the United States or Canada they come from, or what denomination they are, we always get the same sermon. Why on earth don't they go to men's colleges and urge the students not to allow their manly natures to be crushed out by too much mental application?

It's a beautiful day—frozen and icy and clear. As soon as dinner is over, Sallie and Julia and Marty Keene and Eleanor Pratt (friends of mine, but you don't know them) and I are going to put on short skirts and walk 'cross country to Crystal Spring Farm and have a fried chicken and waffle supper, and then have Mr. Crystal Spring drive us home in his buckboard. We are supposed to be inside the campus at seven, but we are going to stretch a point tonight and make it eight.

Farewell, kind Sir.

I have the honour of subscribing myself,

Your most loyall, dutifull, faithfull and obedient servant,

J. Abbott





March 5th

Dear Mr. trustee,

Tomorrow is the first Wednesday in the month—a weary day for the John Grier Home. How relieved they'll be when five o'clock comes and you pat them on the head and take yourselves off! Did you (individually) ever pat me on the head, Daddy? I don't believe so—my memory seems to be concerned only with fat Trustees.

Give the Home my love, please—my truly love. I have quite a feeling of tenderness for it as I look back through a haze of four years. When I first came to college I felt quite resentful because I'd been robbed of the normal kind of childhood that the other girls had had; but now, I don't feel that way in the least. I regard it as a very unusual adventure. It gives me a sort of vantage point from which to stand aside and look at life. Emerging full grown, I get a perspective on the world that other people who have been brought up in the thick of things entirely lack.

I know lots of girls (Julia, for instance) who never know that they are happy. They are so accustomed to the feeling that their senses are deadened to it, but as for me—I am perfectly sure every moment of my life that I am happy. And I'm going to keep on being, no matter what unpleasant things turn up. I'm going to regard them (even toothaches) as interesting experiences, and be glad to know what they feel like. “Whatever sky's above me, I've a heart for any fate.”

However, Daddy, don't take this new affection for the J. G. H. too literally. If I have five children, like Rousseau, I shan't leave them on the steps of a foundling asylum in order to insure their being brought up simply.

Give my kindest regards to Mrs. Lippett (that, I think, is truthful; love would be a little strong) and don't forget to tell her what a beautiful nature I've developed.

Affectionately,

Judy





Lock Willow,

April 4th

Dear Daddy,

Do you observe the postmark? Sallie and I are embellishing Lock Willow with our presence during the Easter vacation. We decided that the best thing we could do with our ten days was to come where it is quiet. Our nerves had got to the point where they wouldn't stand another meal in Fergussen. Dining in a room with four hundred girls is an ordeal when you are tired. There is so much noise that you can't hear the girls across the table speak unless they make their hands into a megaphone and shout. That is the truth.

We are tramping over the hills and reading and writing, and having a nice, restful time. We climbed to the top of Sky Hill this morning where Master Jervie and I once cooked supper—it doesn't seem possible that it was nearly two years ago. I could still see the place where the smoke of our fire blackened the rock. It is funny how certain places get connected with certain people, and you never go back without thinking of them. I was quite lonely without him—for two minutes.

What do you think is my latest activity, Daddy? You will begin to believe that I am incorrigible—I am writing a book. I started it three weeks ago and am eating it up in chunks. I've caught the secret. Master Jervie and that editor man were right; you are most convincing when you write about the things you know. And this time it is about something that I do know—exhaustively. Guess where it's laid? In the John Grier Home! And it's good, Daddy, I actually believe it is—just about the tiny little things that happened every day. I'm a realist now. I've abandoned romanticism; I shall go back to it later though, when my own adventurous future begins.

This new book is going to get itself finished—and published! You see if it doesn't. If you just want a thing hard enough and keep on trying, you do get it in the end. I've been trying for four years to get a letter from you—and I haven't given up hope yet.

Good-bye, Daddy dear,

(I like to call you Daddy dear; it's so alliterative.)

Affectionately,

Judy

P. S. I forgot to tell you the farm news, but it's very distressing. Skip this postscript if you don't want your sensibilities all wrought up.

Poor old Grove is dead. He got so old that he couldn't chew and they had to shoot him.

Nine chickens were killed by a weasel or a skunk or a rat last week.

One of the cows is sick, and we had to have the veterinary surgeon out from Bonnyrigg Four Corners. Amasai stayed up all night to give her linseed oil and whisky. But we have an awful suspicion that the poor sick cow got nothing but linseed oil.

Sentimental Tommy (the tortoiseshell cat) has disappeared; we are afraid he has been caught in a trap.

There are lots of troubles in the world!





May 17th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

This is going to be extremely short because my shoulder aches at the sight of a pen. Lecture notes all day, immortal novel all evening makes too much writing.

Commencement three weeks from next Wednesday. I think you might come and make my acquaintance—I shall hate you if you don't! Julia's inviting Master Jervie, he being her family, and Sallie's inviting Jimmie McB., he being her family, but who is there for me to invite? Just you and Mrs. Lippett, and I don't want her. Please come.

Yours, with love and writer's cramp.

Judy





Lock Willow,

June 19th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

I'm educated! My diploma is in the bottom bureau drawer with my two best dresses. Commencement was as usual, with a few showers at vital moments. Thank you for your rosebuds. They were lovely. Master Jervie and Master Jimmie both gave me roses, too, but I left theirs in the bathtub and carried yours in the class procession.

Here I am at Lock Willow for the summer—forever maybe. The board is cheap, the surroundings quiet and conducive to a literary life. What more does a struggling author wish? I am mad about my book. I think of it every waking moment, and dream of it at night. All I want is peace and quiet and lots of time to work (interspersed with nourishing meals).

Master Jervie is coming up for a week or so in August, and Jimmie McBride is going to drop in sometime through the summer. He's connected with a bond house now, and goes about the country selling bonds to banks. He's going to combine the Farmers' National at the Corners and me on the same trip.

You see that Lock Willow isn't entirely lacking in society. I'd be expecting to have you come motoring through—only I know now that that is hopeless. When you wouldn't come to my commencement, I tore you from my heart and buried you forever.

Judy Abbott, A. B.





July 24th

Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,

Isn't it fun to work—or don't you ever do it? It's especially fun when your kind of work is the thing you'd rather do more than anything else in the world. I've been writing as fast as my pen would go every day this summer, and my only quarrel with life is that the days aren't long enough to write all the beautiful and valuable and entertaining thoughts I'm thinking.

I've finished the second draft of my book and am going to begin the third tomorrow morning at half-past seven. It's the sweetest book you ever saw—it is, truly. I think of nothing else. I can barely wait in the morning to dress and eat before beginning; then I write and write and write till suddenly I'm so tired that I'm limp all over. Then I go out with Colin (the new sheep dog) and romp through the fields and get a fresh supply of ideas for the next day. It's the most beautiful book you ever saw—oh, pardon—I said that before.

You don't think me conceited, do you, Daddy dear?

I'm not, really, only just now I'm in the enthusiastic stage. Maybe later on I'll get cold and critical and sniffy. No, I'm sure I won't! This time I've written a real book. Just wait till you see it.

I'll try for a minute to talk about something else. I never told you, did I, that Amasai and Carrie got married last May? They are still working here, but so far as I can see it has spoiled them both. She used just to laugh when he tramped in mud or dropped ashes on the floor, but now—you should hear her scold! And she doesn't curl her hair any longer. Amasai, who used to be so obliging about beating rugs and carrying wood, grumbles if you suggest such a thing. Also his neckties are quite dingy—black and brown, where they used to be scarlet and purple. I've determined never to marry. It's a deteriorating process, evidently.

There isn't much of any farm news. The animals are all in the best of health. The pigs are unusually fat, the cows seem contented, and the hens are laying well. Are you interested in poultry? If so, let me recommend that invaluable little work 200 Eggs per Hen per Year. I am thinking of starting an incubator next spring and raising broilers. You see I'm settled at Lock Willow permanently. I have decided to stay until I've written 114 novels like Anthony Trollope's mother. Then I shall have completed my life work and can retire and travel.

Mr. James McBride spent last Sunday with us. Fried chicken and ice cream for dinner, both of which he appeared to appreciate. I was awfully glad to see him; he brought a momentary reminder that the world at large exists. Poor Jimmie is having a hard time peddling his bonds. The Farmers' National at the Corners wouldn't have anything to do with them in spite of the fact that they pay six percent interest and sometimes seven. I think he'll end by going home to Worcester and taking a job in his father's factory. He's too open and confiding and kind-hearted ever to make a successful financier. But to be the manager of a flourishing overall factory is a very desirable position, don't you think? Just now he turns up his nose at overalls, but he'll come to them.

I hope you appreciate the fact that this is a long letter from a person with writer's cramp. But I still love you, Daddy dear, and I'm very happy. With beautiful scenery all about, and lots to eat and a comfortable four-post bed and a ream of blank paper and a pint of ink—what more does one want in the world?

Yours, as always,

Judy

P. S. The postman arrives with some more news. We are to expect Master Jervie on Friday next to spend a week. That's a very pleasant prospect—only I am afraid my poor book will suffer. Master Jervie is very demanding.





August 27th

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Where are you, I wonder?

I never know what part of the world you are in, but I hope you're not in New York during this awful weather. I hope you're on a mountain peak (but not in Switzerland; somewhere nearer) looking at the snow and thinking about me. Please be thinking about me. I'm quite lonely and I want to be thought about. Oh, Daddy, I wish I knew you! Then when we were unhappy we could cheer each other up.

I don't think I can stand much more of Lock Willow. I'm thinking of moving. Sallie is going to do settlement work in Boston next winter. Don't you think it would be nice for me to go with her, then we could have a studio together? I could write while she settled and we could be together in the evenings. Evenings are very long when there's no one but the Semples and Carrie and Amasai to talk to. I know ahead of time that you won't like my studio idea. I can read your secretary's letter now：

Miss Jerusha Abbott.

　　Dear Madam,

Mr. Smith prefers that you remain at Lock WiIIow.

　　Yours truIy,

　　EImer H. Griggs

I hate your secretary. I am certain that a man named Elmer H. Griggs must be horrid. But truly, Daddy, I think I shall have to go to Boston. I can't stay here. If something doesn't happen soon, I shall throw myself into the silo pit out of sheer desperation.

Mercy! but it's hot. All the grass is burnt up and the brooks are dry and the roads are dusty. It hasn't rained for weeks and weeks.

This letter sounds as though I had hydrophobia, but I haven't. I just want some family.

Good-bye, my dearest Daddy.

I wish I knew you.

Judy





Lock Willow,

September 19th

Dear Daddy,

Something has happened and I need advice. I need it from you, and from nobody else in the world. Wouldn't it be possible for me to see you? It's so much easier to talk than to write; and I'm afraid your secretary might open the letter.

Judy

P. S. I'm very unhappy.





Lock Willow,

October 3rd

Dear Daddy-Long-Legs,

Your note written in your own hand—and a pretty wobbly hand!—came this morning. I am so sorry that you have been ill; I wouldn't have bothered you with my affairs if I had known. Yes, I will tell you the trouble, but it's sort of complicated to write, and very private. Please don't keep this letter, but burn it.

Before I begin—here's a check for one thousand dollars. It seems funny, doesn't it, for me to be sending a check to you? Where do you think I got it?

I've sold my story, Daddy. It's going to be published serially in seven parts, and then in a book! You might think I'd be wild with joy, but I'm not. I'm entirely apathetic. Of course I'm glad to begin paying you—I owe you over two thousand more. It's coming in installments. Now don't be horrid, please, about taking it, because it makes me happy to return it. I owe you a great deal more than the mere money, and the rest I will continue to pay all my life in gratitude and affection.

And now, Daddy, about the other thing; please give me your most worldly advice, whether you think I'll like it or not.

You know that I've always had a very special feeling toward you; you sort of represented my whole family; but you won't mind, will you, if I tell you that I have a very much more special feeling for another man? You can probably guess without much trouble who he is. I suspect that my letters have been very full of Master Jervie for a very long time.

I wish I could make you understand what he is like and how entirely companionable we are. We think the same about everything—I am afraid I have a tendency to make over my ideas to match his! But he is almost always right; he ought to be, you know, for he has fourteen years' start of me. In other ways, though, he's just an overgrown boy, and he does need looking after—he hasn't any sense about wearing rubbers when it rains. He and I always think the same things are funny, and that is such a lot; it's dreadful when two people's senses of humor are antagonistic. I don't believe there's any bridging that gulf!

And he is—Oh, well! He is just himself, and I miss him, and miss him, and miss him. The whole world seems empty and aching. I hate the moonlight because it's beautiful and he isn't here to see it with me. But maybe you've loved somebody, too, and you know? If you have, I don't need to explain; if you haven't, I can't explain.

Anyway, that's the way I feel—and I've refused to marry him.

I didn't tell him why; I was just dumb and miserable. I couldn't think of anything to say. And now he has gone away imagining that I want to marry Jimmie McBride—I don't in the least, I wouldn't think of marrying Jimmie; he isn't grown up enough. But Master Jervie and I got into a dreadful muddle of misunderstanding, and we both hurt each other's feelings. The reason I sent him away was not because I didn't care for him, but because I cared for him so much. I was afraid he would regret it in the future—and I couldn't stand that! It didn't seem right for a person of my lack of antecedents to marry into any such family as his. I never told him about the orphan asylum, and I hated to explain that I didn't know who I was. I may be dreadful, you know. And his family are proud—and I'm proud, too!

Also, I felt sort of bound to you. After having been educated to be a writer, I must at least try to be one; it would scarcely be fair to accept your education and then go off and not use it. But now that I am going to be able to pay back the money, I feel that I have partially discharged that debt—besides, I suppose I could keep on being a writer even if I did marry. The two professions are not necessarily exclusive.

I've been thinking very hard about it. Of course he is a socialist, and he has unconventional ideas; maybe he wouldn't mind marrying into the proletariat so much as some men might. Perhaps when two people are exactly in accord, and always happy when together and lonely when apart, they ought not to let anything in the world stand between them. Of course I want to believe that! But I'd like to get your unemotional opinion. You probably belong to a Family also, and will look at it from a worldly point of view and not just a sympathetic, human point of view—so you see how brave I am to lay it before you.

Suppose I go to him and explain that the trouble isn't Jimmie, but is the John Grier Home—would that be a dreadful thing for me to do? It would take a great deal of courage. I'd almost rather be miserable for the rest of my life.

This happened nearly two months ago; I haven't heard a word from him since he was here. I was just getting sort of acclimated to the feeling of a broken heart, when a letter came from Julia that stirred me all up again. She said—very casually—that “Uncle Jervis” had been caught out all night in a storm when he was hunting in Canada, and had been ill ever since with pneumonia. And I never knew it. I was feeling hurt because he had just disappeared into blankness without a word. I think he's pretty unhappy, and I know I am!

What seems to you the right thing for me to do?

Judy





October 6th

Dearest Daddy-Long-Legs,

Yes, certainly I'll come—at half-past four next Wednesday afternoon. Of course I can find the way. I've been in New York three times and am not quite a baby. I can't believe that I am really going to see you—I've been just thinking you so long that it hardly seems as though you are a tangible flesh-and-blood person.

You are awfully good, Daddy, to bother yourself with me, when you're not strong. Take care and don't catch cold. These fall rains are very damp.

Affectionately,

Judy

P. S. I've just had an awful thought. Have you a butler? I'm afraid of butlers, and if one opens the door I shall faint upon the step. What can I say to him? You didn't tell me your name. Shall I ask for Mr. Smith?





Thursday Morning

My very dearest Master-Jervie-Daddy-Long-Legs-Pendleton-smith,

Did you sleep last night? I didn't. Not a single wink. I was too amazed and excited and bewildered and happy. I don't believe I ever shall sleep again—or eat either. But I hope you slept; you must, you know, because then you will get well faster and can come to me.

Dear Man, I can't bear to think how ill you've been—and all the time I never knew it. When the doctor came down yesterday to put me in the cab, he told me that for three days they gave you up. Oh, dearest, if that had happened, the light would have gone out of the world for me. I suppose that some day—in the far future—one of us must leave the other; but at least we shall have had our happiness and there will be memories to live with.

I meant to cheer you up—and instead I have to cheer myself. For in spite of being happier than I ever dreamed I could be, I'm also soberer. The fear that something may happen to you rests like a shadow on my heart. Always before I could be frivolous and carefree and unconcerned, because I had nothing precious to lose. But now—I shall have a Great Big Worry all the rest of my life. Whenever you are away from me I shall be thinking of all the automobiles that can run over you, or the signboards that can fall on your head, or the dreadful, squirmy germs that you may be swallowing. My peace of mind is gone forever—but anyway, I never cared much for just plain peace.

Please get well—fast—fast—fast. I want to have you close by where I can touch you and make sure you are tangible. Such a little half hour we had together! I'm afraid maybe I dreamed it. If I were only a member of your family (a very distant fourth cousin) then I could come and visit you every day, and read aloud and plump up your pillow and smooth out those two little wrinkles in your forehead and make the corners of your mouth turn up in a nice cheerful smile. But you are cheerful again, aren't you? You were yesterday before I left. The doctor said I must be a good nurse, that you looked ten years younger. I hope that being in love doesn't make every one ten years younger. Will you still care for me, darling, if I turn out to be only eleven?

Yesterday was the most wonderful day that could ever happen. If I live to be ninety-nine I shall never forget the tiniest detail. The girl that left Lock Willow at dawn was a very different person from the one who came back at night. Mrs. Semple called me at half-past four. I started wide awake in the darkness and the first thought that popped into my head was “I am going to see Daddy-Long-Legs!” I ate breakfast in the kitchen by candle-light, and then drove the five miles to the station through the most glorious October coloring. The sun came up on the way, and the swamp maples and dogwood glowed crimson and orange and the stone walls and cornfields sparkled with hoarfrost; the air was keen and clear and full of promise. I knew something was going to happen. All the way in the train the rails kept singing, “You're going to see Daddy-Long-Legs.” It made me feel secure. I had such faith in Daddy's ability to set things right. And I knew that somewhere another man—dearer than Daddy—was wanting to see me, and somehow I had a feeling that before the journey ended I should meet him, too. And you see!

When I came to the house on Madison Avenue it looked so big and brown and forbidding that I didn't dare go in, so I walked around the block to get up my courage. But I needn't have been a bit afraid; your butler is such a nice, fatherly old man that he made me feel at home at once. “Is this Miss Abbott?” he said to me, and I said, “Yes,” so I didn't have to ask for Mr. Smith after all. He told me to wait in the drawing room. It was a very somber, magnificent, man's sort of room. I sat down on the edge of a big upholstered chair and kept saying to myself：

“I'm going to see Daddy-Long-Legs! I'm going to see Daddy-Long-Legs!”

Then presently the man came back and asked me please to step up to the library. I was so excited that really and truly my feet would hardly take me up. Outside the door he turned and whispered, “He's been very ill, miss. This is the first day he's been allowed to sit up. You'll not stay long enough to excite him?” I knew from the way he said it that he loved you—and I think he's an old dear!

Then he knocked and said, “Miss Abbott,” and I went in and the door closed behind me.

It was so dim coming in from the brightly lighted hall that for a moment I could scarcely make out anything; then I saw a big easy chair before the fire and a shining tea table with a smaller chair beside it. And I realized that a man was sitting in the big chair propped up by pillows with a rug over his knees. Before I could stop him he rose—sort of shakily—and steadied himself by the back of the chair and just looked at me without a word. And then—and then—I saw it was you! But even with that I didn't understand. I thought Daddy had had you come there to meet me for a surprise.

Then you laughed and held out your hand and said, “Dear little Judy, couldn't you guess that I was Daddy-Long-Legs?”

In an instant it flashed over me. Oh, but I have been stupid! A hundred little things might have told me, if I had had any wits. I wouldn't make a very good detective, would I, Daddy?—Jervie? What must I call you? Just plain Jervie sounds disrespectful and I can't be disrespectful to you!

It was a very sweet half hour before your doctor came and sent me away. I was so dazed when I got to the station that I almost took a train for St. Louis. And you were pretty dazed, too. You forgot to give me any tea. But we're both very, very happy, aren't we? I drove back to Lock Willow in the dark—but oh, how the stars were shining! And this morning I've been out with Colin visiting all the places that you and I went to together, and remembering what you said and how you looked. The woods today are burnished bronze and the air is full of frost. It's climbing weather. I wish you were here to climb the hills with me. I am missing you dreadfully, Jervie dear, but it's a happy kind of missing; we'll be together soon. We belong to each other now really and truly, no make-believe. Doesn't it seem queer for me to belong to some one at last? It seems very, very sweet.

And I shall never let you be sorry for a single instant.

Yours, forever and ever,

Judy

P. S. This is the first love letter I ever wrote. Isn't it funny that I know how?
