title: Chapter 13：“Touching the Tiger’s Buttocks”：The Third Vietnam War
---





1. ?“Touch ?the ?tiger's ?buttocks” ?is ?a ?Chinese ?idiom ?popularized ?by ?Mao, meaning to do something daring or dangerous. The occasion of this remark was my meeting with Hua Guofeng in Beijing in April 1979.

2. During the Cultural Revolution, then Defense Minister Lin Biao abolished all ?ranks ?and ?insignia ?and ?ordered ?extensive ?ideological ?training ?for ?Chinese troops ?using ?the ?“Little ?Red ?Book” ?of ?Mao's ?aphorisms. The ?PLA ?was ?called ?on to play social and ideological roles far outside the mission of an ordinary military. A ?penetrating ?account ?of ?the ?toll ?these ?developments ?took ?on ?the ?PLA ?during ?the conflict with Vietnam may be found in Edward O’Dowd, Chinese Military Strategy in the Third Indochina War ?(New York：Routledge, 2007).

(Brackets in original.)

4. ?I ?have ?always ?believed ?that ?having ?been ?willing ?to ?force ?the-to ?Mao-?ideologically ?correct ?Khmer ?Rouge ?into ?a ?compromise, ?unnecessarily ?as ?it ?turned out, ?contributed ?to ?Zhou's ?fall. ?See ?also ?Kissinger, ?Years ?of ?Upheaval ? (Boston：Little, Brown, 1982), 368.

8. In April 1978, the Afghan President was assassinated and his government was ?replaced; ?on ?December ?5, ?1978, ?the ?Soviet ?Union ?and ?the ?new ?government of Afghanistan ?entered ?into ?a ?Treaty ?of ?Friendship, ?Good-Neighborliness ?and Cooperation; and on February 19, 1979, the U.S. ambassador to Afghanistan was assassinated.

11. ?The ?five ?principles ?were：?affirmation ?of ?a ?one ?China ?policy; ?a commitment ?not ?to ?offer American ?support ?to Taiwan ?independence ?movements; American ?discouragement ?of ?a ?hypothetical ?Japanese ?deployment ?into Taiwan; support for any peaceful resolution between Beijing and Taipei; and a commitment to ?continued ?normalization. ?See ?Chapter ?9, ?“Resumption ?of ?Relations：?First Encounters with Mao and Zhou,” page 271.

23. ?In ?recent ?years, ?Chinese ?leaders ?and ?policy ?analysts ?have ?introduced the phrase “peaceful rise” to describe China's foreign policy aspiration to achieve major-power ?status ?within ?the ?framework ?of ?the ?existing ?international ?system. In ?a ?thoughtful ?article ?synthesizing ?both ?Chinese ?and Western ?scholarship ?on ?the concept, ?the ?scholar ?Barry ?Buzan ?raises ?the ?prospect ?that ?China's ?“peaceful ?rise” began ?in ?the ?late ?1970s ?and ?early ?1980s, ?as ?Deng ?increasingly ?aligned ?China's domestic development and foreign policy to the nonrevolutionary world and sought out common interests with the West. Deng's trips abroad offered dramatic proof of this ?realignment. ?See ?Barry ?Buzan, ?“China ?in ?International ?Society：?Is ?‘Peaceful Rise’ Possible?” ?The Chinese Journal of International Politics 3 (2010)：12–13.

35. Twenty-two years represented the interval between the two world wars.

Hill a decade earlier. See also Chapter 8, “The Road to Reconciliation,” page 207; and Chen Jian and David L.
