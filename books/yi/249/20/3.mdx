4. ?Opinion ?differs ?as ?to ?whether ?the ?inclusion ?of ?Most ?Favored ?Nation clauses in these initial treaties represented a concerted Chinese strategy or a tactical oversight. ?One ?scholar ?notes ?that ?in ?some ?respects ?it ?curtailed ?the ?Qing ?court's scope of maneuver in subsequent negotiations with the foreign powers, since any Western power could be sure it would gain the benefits afforded to its rivals. On the other hand, the practical effect was to prevent any one colonizer from attaining a dominant economic position—a contrast to the experience of many neighboring countries during this period. See Immanuel C. Y. Hsü, The Rise of Modern China, 6th ed. (Oxford：Oxford University Press, 2000), 190–92.

14. ?Commenting ?acidly ?on ?the ?loss ?of Vladivostok ?115 ?years ?later ?(and ?on President ?Ford's ?summit ?with ?Soviet ?General ?Secretary ?Leonid ?Brezhnev ?in ?that city), ?Deng ?Xiaoping ?told ?me ?that ?the ?different ?names ?given ?to ?the ?city ?by ?the Chinese ?and ?the ?Russians ?reflected ?their ?respective ?purposes：?the ?Chinese ?name translated ?roughly ?as ?“Sea ?Slug,” ?while ?the ?Russian ?name ?meant ?“Rule ?of ?the East.” “I don't think it has any other meaning except what it means at face value,” he added.

15. “The New Foreign Policy of January 1861,” in Teng and Fairbank, eds., China's Response to the West, 48. For consistency within the present volume, the spelling of “Nian” has been changed in this passage from “Nien,” the spelling more common ?at ?the ?time ?of ?the ?quoted ?book's ?publication. The ?underlying ?Chinese word is the same.

39. The ?occasion ?of ?the ?1874 ?crisis ?was ?a ?shipwreck ?of ?a ?Ryukyu ?Islands crew ?on ?the ?far ?southeast ?coast ?of ?Taiwan, ?and ?the ?murder ?of ?the ?sailors ?by ?a Taiwanese ?tribe. ?When ?Japan ?demanded ?a ?harsh ?indemnity, ?Beijing ?initially responded ?that ?it ?had ?no ?jurisdiction ?over ?un-Sinicized ?tribes. ?In ?the ?traditional Chinese ?view, ?this ?had ?a ?certain ?logic：?“barbarians” ?were ?not ?Beijing's responsibility. Seen in modern international legal and political terms, it was almost certainly a miscalculation, since it signaled that China did not exert full authority over Taiwan. Japan responded with a punitive expedition against the island, which Qing authorities proved powerless to stop. Tokyo then prevailed on Beijing to pay an indemnity, which one contemporary observer called “a transaction which really sealed ?the ?fate ?of ?China, ?in ?advertising ?to ?the ?world ?that ?here ?was ?a ?rich ?Empire which was ready to pay, but not ready to fight.” (Alexander Michie, An Englishman?in ?China ?During ?the ?Victorian ?Era, ?vol. ?2 ?[London：William ?Blackwood ?& ?Sons, 1900], ?256.) What ?made ?the ?crisis ?additionally ?damaging ?to ?China ?was ?that ?until that point, both Beijing and Tokyo had laid claim to the Ryukyu Islands as a tribute state; ?after ?the ?crisis, ?the ?islands ?fell ?under ?Japan's ?sway. ?See ?Hsü, ?The ?Rise ?of Modern China , 315–17.

46. ?In ?contrast ?with ?earlier ?indemnities, ?most ?of ?the ?Boxer ?indemnity ?was later renounced or redirected by the foreign powers to charitable enterprises within China. The United States directed a portion of its indemnity to the construction of Tsinghua University in Beijing.
