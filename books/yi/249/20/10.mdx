5. George Kennan's 1946 “Long Telegram” from Moscow and his nominally anonymous 1947 Foreign Affairs article, “The Sources of Soviet Conduct,” argued that the Soviet Union was driven by ideology to implacable hostility to the United States and the West, and that Soviet-led Communism would expand wherever not met ?by ?a ?resolute ?response. Though ?Kennan ?posited ?that ?Soviet ?pressure ?could be “contained by the adroit and vigilant application of counter-force at a series of constantly ?shifting ?geographical ?and ?political ?points,” ?his ?theory ?of ?containment?was ?not ?primarily ?a ?military ?doctrine; ?it ?placed ?significant ?weight ?on ?the ?use ?of diplomatic ?pressure ?and ?the ?power ?of ?internal ?political ?and ?social ?reform ?in ?the non-Communist world as a bulwark against Soviet expansion.
