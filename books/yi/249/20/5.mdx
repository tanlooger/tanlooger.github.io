15. The results of postwar Sino-Soviet negotiations still rankled four decades later. In 1989, Deng Xiaoping urged President George H. W. Bush to “look at the map ?to ?see ?what ?happened ?after ?the ?Soviet ?Union ?severed ?Outer ?Mongolia ?from China. What kind of strategic situation did we find ourselves in? Those over fifty in China remember that the shape of China was like a maple leaf. Now, if you look at a map, you see a huge chunk of the north cut away.” George H. W. Bush and Brent Scowcroft, ?A ?World ?Transformed ?(New York：Alfred A. ?Knopf, ?1998), ?95–96. Deng's reference to China's strategic situation must be understood also in light of the significant Soviet military presence in Mongolia, which began during the Sino-Soviet split and lasted throughout the Cold War.
