(Cambridge：Cambridge University Press, 1997), 278–81, 299–301. In quest of finding a successor among China's “pure” young generation, Mao ?elevated ?the ?thirty-seven-year-old Wang ?Hongwen, ?previously ?distinguished only ?as ?a ?provincial-level ?leftist ?organizer, ?to ?the ?third-ranking ?position ?in ?the Communist ?Party ?hierarchy. ?His ?meteoric ?rise ?baffled ?many ?observers. ?Closely aligned with Jiang Qing, Wang never achieved an independent political identity or authority commensurate with his formal position. He fell with the rest of the Gang of Four in October 1976.
