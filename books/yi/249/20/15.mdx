1. ?Jonathan ?Spence ?notes ?that ?1989 ?represented ?a ?convergence ?of ?several politically ?charged ?anniversaries：?it ?was ?“the ?two ?hundredth ?anniversary ?of ?the French ?Revolution, ?the ?seventieth ?anniversary ?of ?the ?May ?Fourth ?movement, ?the fortieth birthday of the People's Republic itself, and the passage of ten years since?formal diplomatic relations with the United States had been reinstituted.” Spence, The Search for Modern China (New York：W. W. Norton, 1999), 696.

5. An ?example ?of ?one ?such ?attempt ?to ?implement ?conditionality ?was ?the Clinton administration's policy of conditioning China's Most Favored Nation trade status on changes in its human rights record, to be discussed more fully in Chapter 17, “A Roller Coaster Ride Toward Another Reconciliation：The Jiang Zemin Era.”

9. Congress and the White House shared a concern that visiting students who had publicly protested in the United States would be subject to punishment on their return ?to ?China. The ?President ?had ?signaled ?that ?applications ?for ?visa ?extensions would be treated favorably, while Congress sought to grant the extensions without requiring an application. 10.

25. ?Deng ?had ?made ?clear ?that ?he ?intended ?to ?retire ?very ?shortly. ?He ?did, ?in fact, do so in 1992, though he continued to be regarded as an influential arbiter of policy.

26. The five principles of peaceful coexistence were negotiated by India and China ?in ?1954. They ?concerned ?coexistence ?and ?mutual ?noninterference ?between countries with different ideological orientations.

27. Deng made a similar point to Richard Nixon during the latter's October 1989 ?private ?visit ?to ?Beijing：?“Please ?tell ?President ?Bush ?let's ?end ?the ?past, ?the United States ought to take the initiative, and only the United States can take the initiative. The ?United ?States ?is ?able ?to ?take ?the ?initiative. ?. ?. ?. ?China ?is ?unable ?to initiate. This is because the stronger is America, the weaker is China, the injured is China. If you want China to beg, it cannot be done. If it drags on a hundred years, the Chinese people can’t beg [you] to end sanctions [against China]. . . . Whatever Chinese leader makes a mistake in this respect would surely fall, the Chinese people will not forgive him.” As quoted in Lampton, Same Bed, Different Dreams, 29.

28. Some in the White House maintained that it was unnecessarily provocative to ?invite ?Fang ?Lizhi ?to ?attend ?a ?presidential ?banquet ?with ?the ?same ?Chinese authorities ?he ?was ?criticizing. They ?blamed ?the American ?Embassy ?in ?Beijing ?for failing ?to ?forewarn ?them ?of ?the ?impending ?controversy. ?In ?including ?Fang ?on ?the list of potential invitees, the American ambassador in Beijing, Winston Lord, had in fact flagged him as an outspoken dissident whose inclusion might provoke Chinese?government consternation, but who nonetheless merited an invitation.
