Sura-na Bheda Pramaana Sunaavo;

Bheda, Abheda, Pratham kara Jaano.





让我知道你可以辨别歌曲中的音符；

但是首先，让我看看你能否分辨

其中哪些音符可分

哪些不可分

——根据古典梵语诗歌创作的音乐作品




我的父亲用Abhed（身份）来表述基因“不可分割”的属性。而它的反义词Bhed却具有多重含义：“辨别”（动词形式）、“练习”、“决定”、“辨别”、“分割”以及“治愈”。Bhed与vidya（知识）和ved（医学）拥有相同的词根。此外，印度教经典“吠陀”（Vedas）也得名于相同的出处。它起源于古代印欧词语（uied）,具有“了解”或“辨识”的含义。

众所周知，从事科研工作的人不可避免地会带有职业病，在对世界进行充分了解之前，我们必须将其分割成基因、原子以及比特等基本组成部分。我们不知道是否有其他方法可行，因此想要化零为整就必须先化整为零。

但是这种方法存在某种潜在的风险。一旦认识到人类这种生物体是由基因、环境以及基因—环境交互作用组成的，那么就会从根本上改变我们对于人类的定义。伯格对我说：“虽然任何理智的生物学家都会认为人类不过是个体基因的产物，但是我们对自身的感知将随着外源基因引入发生改变。”1即便是化零为整也无法令其再恢复到化整为零之前的原样。

就像梵语诗歌所述：


让我知道你可以辨别歌曲中的音符；

但是首先，让我看看你能否分辨

其中哪些音符可分

哪些不可分

现在人类遗传学还面临着三项艰巨的挑战，而它们均与辨别、分割和最终重建有关。其中第一项挑战就是辨别人类基因组中信息编码的确切本质。尽管人类基因组计划已经为后续工作奠定了基础，但是目前我们还面临着许多悬而未决的问题，例如，人类基因组中30亿个碱基对究竟“编码”了什么信息？基因组中的功能元件是什么？尽管基因组包含有21 000至24 000个蛋白质编码基因，但是其中分布的基因调节序列与DNA片段（内含子）将把基因分割成不同的区块。基因组中的信息可以构建成千上万的RNA分子，虽然它们无法被翻译成蛋白质，但是依然会在细胞生理过程中发挥多种作用。而我们曾经认为的那些“垃圾”DNA有可能编码了几百种未知的功能。此外，在细胞核的三维结构中，染色体在经过缠绕与折叠后可以通过相互接触发挥作用。

2013年，为了理解基因组中每个元件的作用，美国国立人类基因组研究所启动了一项庞大的国际合作计划，旨在创建一个涵盖全部人类基因组功能元件（染色体上任意具有编码或者指导功能的DNA序列）的目录。该项目被巧妙地命名为“DNA元件百科全书计划”（Encyclopedia of DNA Elements，ENC-O-DE），而它将对人类基因组序列中包含的全部信息进行交叉注释。

只要生物学家鉴定出这些功能“元件”，那么他们就将面对第二项挑战：理解这些元件在不同的时间与空间中交互作用的机制，以及它们对于人类胚胎发育、生理功能、解剖结构与生物体独有的属性与特征的影响。[1]然而令人感到尴尬的是，我们对于基因组知之甚少：人类对于自身基因及其功能的大部分认知均来自酵母菌、蠕虫、果蝇与小鼠中的相似基因。就像戴维·博特斯坦写的那样：“能够直接用于研究的人类基因屈指可数。”2新型基因组学的部分任务就是缩短小鼠与人类之间的差距，以便于在近似人体环境的背景下确定人类基因如何发挥功能。

如果该项目能够顺利实施，那么将为医学遗传学提供某些重要的帮助。人类基因组功能注释将有助于生物学家阐明疾病发生的新机制。虽然根据新型基因组元件与复杂疾病的内在联系就可以确定其最终原因，但是我们目前在该领域的研究仍旧一无所获，例如，遗传信息、行为暴露与随机因素的交互作用如何对高血压、精神分裂症、抑郁症、肥胖、癌症或心脏病产生影响。为了明确这些疾病的发病机制，我们需要首先在基因组中找到与它们关联的正确功能元件。

与此同时，了解这些关联亦可用于发现人类基因组的预测能力。2011年，心理学家埃里克·特克海默在一篇颇具影响力的综述中写道：“家族研究（双胞胎、兄弟姐妹、父母与子女以及被收养者）在经历了一个世纪的发展后终于建立起完整的谱系，而人们也逐渐打消了对于基因在解释全部人类差异（从病态到常态以及从生物到行为）时重要作用的质疑。”3然而尽管上述关联具有很强的说服力，但是特克海默笔下的“基因世界”要比预期的更加错综复杂。到目前为止，基因变化仅对那些导致表型发生显著改变的高外显率疾病具有强大的预测作用。由于我们很难对于多个基因变异形成的组合进行解读，因此根本无法确定某种特定基因的排列组合（基因型）在未来会产生何种特定结果（表型），而此类情况在结果受到多个基因支配的时候显得尤为突出。

但是随着新技术的应用，这种僵局将很快得到改观。现在让我们在脑海中虚拟一项思维实验。假设我们可以前瞻性（在不了解任何儿童未来的前提下）地对10万名儿童的基因组进行全面测序，然后针对每位儿童创建出包含全部变异与功能元件组合在内的数据库（这里所说的10万只是一种数量上的泛指，实验对象可以被扩展至任何数量的儿童）。现在假设我们已经获得了该队列儿童的“命运图谱”，并且将鉴定出的每种疾病与生理异常记录于平行的数据库中，那么我们或许可以将这种记录着个体全套表型（属性、特征、行为）的图谱称为人类“表型组”。接下来，假设某种计算引擎能够对来自遗传图谱或命运图谱的数据进行挖掘配对，那么我们就可以根据这些结果对于双方做出预测。尽管上述方法仍存在各种不确定性（甚至非常严重），但是10万份基因组与表型组图谱构成的数据集依然具有强大的说服力，它可以描绘出编码于基因组内部的人类命运本质。

这种命运图谱的特别之处就在于它不会受到疾病检测领域的局限，该方法还可以根据我们的需求在广度、深度以及详细程度上进行调整。目前命运图谱可能的应用范围包括低出生体重儿、学龄前学习障碍、青春期短暂躁动、青少年迷恋、婚姻、出柜、不孕症、中年危机、成瘾倾向、左眼白内障、早秃、抑郁、心脏病以及晚期卵巢癌或乳腺癌。虽然这种实验在过去简直无法想象，但是计算技术、数据存储与基因测序的协同作用将使其在未来成为可能。我们可以把它看作某种规模庞大的双胞胎实验（研究对象并不是双胞胎）：该方法可以跨越时空对基因组与表型组进行匹配，然后通过计算创建出数以百万计的虚拟遗传“双胞胎”，而这些排列组合就能够被用于生命事件的注释。

由于通过基因组来预测疾病与命运的方法具有自身局限性，因此我们需要对于此类项目保持清醒的认识。“也许，”就像某位评论员所批评的那样，“遗传学解释的命运最终将脱离传统的病因学理论，它不仅无法完全呈现环境因素的作用，还会产生某些可怕的医学干预手段，而这种方法对于诠释人类命运根本没有任何作用。”4但是此类研究的意义在于它可以“摆脱”疾病的束缚，人们可以通过基因来理解个体发育与命运转归的变迁。如果能够将背景依赖或环境依赖的情况稀释或滤除，那么保留下来的就是深受基因影响的事件。总体而言，只要人群数量与计算能力达到一定程度，我们就可以确定并算出基因组拥有的全部预测能力。

相比之下，最后一项挑战的意义可能最为深远。就像根据人类基因组预测人类表型组的能力主要受限于计算技术的缺乏一样，定向改变基因组的能力也受制于生物学技术的短板。由于基因导入系统（病毒）存在效率低下、可靠性差甚至意外致死，所以我们几乎无法将外源基因定向导入至人类胚胎。

然而随着新技术的应用，这些障碍也将开始土崩瓦解。目前，“基因编辑”技术能够使遗传学家在精准改造基因组的同时保持高度的特异性。原则上来讲，我们可以通过定向方式在其他30亿对碱基不变的情况下让DNA中的某个碱基产生突变（这种技术就相当于某种编辑设备，当完成了扫描66卷《大英百科全书》的任务后，它可以在不影响其他内容的同时发现、擦除或改变某个单词）。在2010年至2014年间，我实验室的一位博士后研究员曾尝试采用标准基因传递病毒将某个明确的基因改变导入某个细胞系，但是最终收效甚微。2015年，当实验方法改为以CRISPR为基础的新型技术后，她只用了6个月的时间就在14个人类基因组中实现了14处基因改变，其中还包括了人类胚胎干细胞基因组，而这在过去完全是难以置信的丰功伟绩。全世界的遗传学家与基因治疗学家都在急不可耐地探索改变人类基因组的可能性，其实造成这种氛围的原因在某种程度上与生物技术的迅速发展密切相关。干细胞技术、细胞核移植、表观遗传修饰以及基因编辑方法的联合应用使得操纵人类基因组与转基因人类成为可能。

其实我们并不了解这些技术在实际应用中的保真性或效率到底如何。定向改变某个基因是否会引起基因组其他部分出现意外改变？某些基因是否比其他基因更容易“被编辑”呢？又是什么在调控基因的可塑性呢？我们不知道对于某个基因的定向改变是否会导致整个基因组发生失调。如果有些基因的作用就相当于道金斯所描述的“配方”，那么改变某个基因就可能对基因调控产生深远的影响，并且会产生类似蝴蝶效应的一系列下游结果。如果此类蝴蝶效应基因在基因组中屡见不鲜，那么它们将成为基因编辑技术的主要限制因素。基因的不连续性（遗传单位的离散性与自主性）也许只是某种幻觉：基因之间的内在联系可能比我们想象中的更为紧密。


但是首先，让我看看你能否分辨



其中哪些音符可分



哪些不可分




现在假设这些技术已经可以在某种环境下得到常规应用。女性在怀孕以后，每位父母都可以选择是否对子宫内的胎儿进行全基因组检测。如果发现胎儿携带有严重的致病突变，那么父母可以决定是否在孕早期终止妊娠，或是在经过全面遗传筛查后选择性地植入“正常”胎儿（我们将称其为全面胚胎植入前遗传学诊断，或c—PGD）。[2]

此外，基因组测序也可以鉴定出导致疾病倾向的复杂基因组合。假如携带此类可预测疾病倾向基因的孩子出生后，那么他们将在整个童年时代接受选择性干预措施。例如，对于某个具有遗传性肥胖倾向的孩子来说，他可能会在儿童时期接受体重变化监测、替代饮食治疗或使用激素、药物以及基因治疗进行代谢“重编程”。而具有注意力缺陷或多动症倾向的儿童可能会接受行为治疗或为其安排丰富多彩的教学活动。

如果疾病已经发生或出现进展，那么就应该使用基因疗法来治疗或者治愈患者。我们可以直接将矫正基因导入病变组织：例如，将功能性囊性纤维化基因雾化后注入患者的肺部即可使其恢复部分正常功能。而某位先天患有ADA缺乏症的女孩可以接受携带矫正基因的骨髓干细胞移植。对于较为复杂的遗传病来说，我们将采用基因诊断与基因治疗、药物治疗以及“环境疗法”相结合的手段。只要能够记录下导致某种癌症出现恶性增殖的突变，那么就可以对该肿瘤进行全面分析。这些突变将被用于鉴定引发细胞异常增殖的致病通路，而据此设计出的靶向治疗能够在保护正常细胞的同时精准地杀伤恶性细胞。

2015年，精神病学家理查德·弗里德曼（Richard Friedman）在《纽约时报》发表的文章中写道：“假设你是一名从战场上归来且患有创伤后应激障碍（post-traumatic stress disorder, PTSD）的士兵，那么只要通过简单的抽血化验来检测基因变异就可以了解你是否具有恐惧消退的能力……如果你携带降低恐惧消退能力的突变，那么治疗师就会明白可能需要增加暴露疗法的强度与疗程才能奏效。或者说，你可能需要接受暴露疗法以外的其他治疗方案，例如人际关系治疗或药物治疗。”5或许应该将消除表观遗传标记的药物与谈话治疗联合使用，细胞记忆的消除或许可以缓解历史记忆的负担。

除此之外，基因诊断与基因干预也将用于人类胚胎的筛查与矫正。如果能够在生殖细胞中鉴定出某些基因的“可干预”突变，那么父母就可以在受孕前选择基因手术来改变精子与卵子，或者从怀孕伊始就借助产前筛查来避免植入携带突变的胚胎。通过阳性选择、阴性选择或基因组修饰等方法，我们就能预先把导致严重疾病的基因变异从人类基因组中清除出去。

假如你已经仔细阅读了上述方案，那么就会发现科学奇迹背后隐藏的道德风险。对于癌症、精神分裂症以及囊性纤维化进行靶向治疗是医学发展的重要标志（尽管这些内容令人感到既遥远又陌生），但是个体干预并不能成为超越法律与道德底线的借口。如果这个世界由“预生存者”与“后人类”组成，那么他们不是接受了基因易损性的筛查就是改变了遗传倾向。随着人类疾病、痛苦、创伤、突变、虚弱与机会逐渐远去，我们的身份、怜悯、历史、变异、易感与选择也将渺无踪迹。[3]

1990年，当蠕虫遗传学家约翰·萨尔斯顿起草人类基因组计划的时候，他对智能生物“学会解读自身指令”导致的哲学困惑感到十分惊诧。不仅如此，这种困惑随着智能生物开始学习编写自身指令而变得愈发不可收拾。倘若基因与生物体可以相互决定对方的本质与命运，那么这种逻辑循环就可以形成闭环。一旦我们开始考虑把基因与命运画等号，就会不可避免地会将人类基因组当作昭昭天命。

当我们探望完莫尼准备离开加尔各答的时候，父亲还想在他童年住过的房子外面稍作停留，而他和兄弟们就在这里目睹了拉杰什遭受躁郁症的折磨。我们一路上默不作声，任由父亲的思绪沉浸在对往事的追忆里。我们将车停在哈亚特汗街狭窄的入口处，然后一起缓步走到小巷的尽头。那时大约是晚上6点，街边的房屋笼罩在昏暗的灯光下，潮湿的空气似乎预示着随时就要下雨。

“孟加拉历史上最重要的一件事情就是印巴分治。”父亲对我说道。他望着我们头顶上突出的阳台努力地回忆着以前邻居的名字：戈什（Ghosh）、塔卢克达尔（Talukdar）、穆克吉（Mukherjee）、查特吉（Chatterjee）以及森（Sen）。我注意到房屋之间密布着许多晾衣绳，也许落在身上的那些蒙蒙细雨就来自那些刚洗完的湿衣服。父亲说道：“印巴分治的结果关乎这座城市每个人的切身利益，而你的家园要么毁于这场灾难，要么就会成为别人的庇护所。”他指着我们头顶上那些窗口的柱廊喃喃自语道：“这里的每户人家都曾接纳过逃难的同胞。”尽管来自四面八方的人们彼此并不熟悉，但是大家在患难与共的过程中已经融为一体。

“当我们从巴里萨尔一路颠簸来到加尔各答的时候，虽然随身只携带了四个笨重的钢制行李箱与少量生活用品，但是内心已经开始憧憬未来的新生活。”我知道在那条街上生活的每个家庭都有自己的辛酸血泪史。似乎人们的各种差异都趋于平等，而这就像是冬天仅剩下植物根茎的花园。

对于许多像父亲一样的人来说，从孟加拉东部至西部的迁徙令他们的生活被彻底重置。让我们将时间恢复到元年，而历史也被割裂为分治之前（BP）与分治之后（AP）。印巴分治造成的灾难摧毁了原本和谐的生活：与父亲同时代的人们在不知不觉中就成了这项天然实验的牺牲品。只要时钟被重新归零，那么我们仿佛就可以回到人类的起点，然后近距离地观察生活、命运与选择的转归。在此过程中，父亲的感受可以用刻骨铭心来形容：一位兄弟（拉杰什）患上了躁郁症，而另一位兄弟（贾古）的现实生活也支离破碎。尽管祖母对于新生事物始终抱有谨小慎微的态度，但是我的父亲却从心底里喜欢尝试冒险。这些看似迥异的属性隐藏在每个人的体内，它们就像缩微人一样等待重获新生。

到底是什么力量或机制才能解释人类个体截然不同的命运与选择呢？人们在18世纪之前曾经把个体命运归结于神的旨意。其中印度教徒长期以来认为个体命运与其前世的因果报应密不可分（在印度教中，主神就像一位至高无上的道德税务会计师，他将根据既往投资的盈亏来清点与分配命运的优劣）。而基督教中的上帝也是恩威并施的化身，他既是桀骜不驯的运动员又是最终命运的裁判员。

19世纪与20世纪的医学发展为命运与选择提供了更为世俗化的概念。疾病或许是命运中最为常见的典型代表，我们可以通过规范的术语对其进行描述，它们不再是天谴神罚的愚昧无知，而是风险、暴露、体质、环境与行为共同作用的结果。与此同时，我们把选择理解为个体心理、经历、记忆、创伤与身世表达的一种方式。到了20世纪中期，身份、亲缘、气质与偏好（异性恋与同性恋或冲动与谨慎）越来越多地被描述为是心理冲动、个人历史与随机因素交互作用产生的现象，因此就诞生了涵盖命运与选择的流行病学。

在21世纪开始的前10年，我们开始学习使用另外一种语言来讲述因果，然后以此来构建某种全新的自我流行病学：我们开始从基因与基因组的角度来描述疾病、身份、亲缘、气质以及偏好，并且最终运用上述理论来诠释命运与选择。尽管基因作为反映人类本质与命运的唯一途径并非是遥不可及的天方夜谭，但是这种颇具争议的观点也让我们在面对历史与未来的时候谨言慎行：基因对于人类生存的影响要远比我们想象中的更为错综复杂与惊心动魄。当我们尝试去定向解读、改变与操纵基因组，并且获得改变未来命运与选择的能力时，上述观点也就变得愈发具有煽动性与破坏性。1919年，摩尔根曾经写道：“人类最终会了解自然的本质，而所谓的神秘莫测不过是场错觉罢了。”6随着科学技术的突飞猛进，我们当前正在把摩尔根的结论从了解自然扩展至领悟人性。

我的脑海中经常会出现贾古与拉杰什的身影，假设兄弟二人出生在距今50年到100年的未来，那么他们的生活轨迹又会是什么样子呢？我们能否根据遗传学易感性来治愈摧残他们生命的疾病呢？这种知识能否帮助他们恢复“正常”呢？如果答案是肯定的话，那么又会涉及何种道德、社会与生物危害呢？人们对于这种类型的知识是否会产生全新的理解与同情呢？还是说它们会成为新型歧视的核心内容？这种知识能被用来重新定义什么是“自然”吗？

但是“自然”到底是什么呢？我扪心自问。从一方面来说，它具有变异、突变、转换、无常、离散与流动的属性；而另一方面，它还表现出恒常、持久、完整与保真的特征。那么我们该如何辨别自然的身份呢？由于DNA本身就是一种自相矛盾的分子，因此它编码的生物体也是千奇百怪。我们原本想从遗传特征中总结出恒常的规律，但是却在不经意之间发现了变异（对立面）的奥秘，同时还认识到突变是保持人类本质的必要条件。我们体内的基因组正在努力维系着各种力量之间脆弱的平衡，其中就包括彼此互补的双螺旋结构、错综复杂的过去和未来以及挥之不去的欲望和记忆，而这也构成了世间万物最为人性的核心。因此如何科学管理就成为人类认知世界与明辨是非的终极挑战。


[1] 为了理解基因形成生物体的机制，我们不仅要了解基因，更要了解RNA、蛋白质以及表观标志物。未来的研究将能够揭示基因组、蛋白质变异体（蛋白质组）以及表观标志物（表观基因组）相互协调构建与维护人体的机制。



[2] 对于胎儿基因组进行全面检测在临床上被称为无创产前检测（Noninvasive Prenatal Testing , NIPT）。2014年，某家中国公司宣布已经完成了150 000例胎儿染色体的检测，而除此之外该公司还将该方法用于捕获单基因突变。虽然此类染色体异常（例如唐氏综合征）检测乍看起来与羊膜穿刺术的结果具有相同的保真性，但是它依然无法解决“假阳性”这个主要问题（也就是说，胎儿DNA检测认定的染色体异常结果与实际情况相反）。不过好在假阳性率将随着技术的发展大幅降低。



[3] 然而即便是看似简单明了的遗传筛查检测也会将我们卷入道德风险的困境。现在我们以弗里德曼筛查士兵中PTSD易感基因的设想为例。初看起来，这种方法似乎可以缓解他们经受的战争创伤：只要筛选出那些没有“恐惧消退”能力的士兵，然后对他们进行强化精神治疗或药物治疗就可以使其恢复正常。但是如果我们在部署任务之前就对士兵的PTSD风险进行筛查呢？这种做法真的有必要吗？我们真的想挑选出冷漠无情或是先天对于暴力无动于衷的士兵吗？我个人对于此类筛查持否定态度：失去“恐惧消退”制约的心态实际上是战争中应该避免的危险行为。





致谢


2010年5月，当《众病之王：癌症传》这部作品定稿之时，我从来没有想到自己会再次执笔撰写另外一部著作。虽然《众病之王：癌症传》带来的体力透支容易恢复，但是我的想象力几乎在写作过程中消耗殆尽。就在该书获得当年的《卫报》新人奖（Guardian First Book Prize）后，有一位评论家曾经埋怨应该将这部作品提名为“最佳图书奖”，而这种意外的惊喜让我彻底打消了内心的忧虑。《众病之王：癌症传》不仅是情节构思的创新更是人生角色的转换，我正是在它的启蒙下才逐步成长为一名作家的。

尽管《众病之王：癌症传》已经做到知无不尽，但是它并不能反映恶变之前的常态。如果把癌症这种“扭曲自我”比作《贝奥武甫》（Beowulf）中的魔鬼，那么是何种力量在维系正常的新陈代谢呢？于是我在探究常态、身份、变异与遗传奥秘的过程中创作了《基因传》，而这部作品其实可以被视为《众病之王：癌症传》的前传。1

虽然家庭与遗传的话题始终贯穿着人们的生活，但是市面上反映这些内容的书籍并不多见，因此我非常感谢大家在《基因传》创作中给予的鼎力支持。我的妻子萨拉·斯茨（Sarah Sze）是这部作品最忠实的读者与知音，同时女儿莉拉（Leela）与阿丽雅（Aria）每天都在提醒我她们在未来可能面临的风险。毋庸置疑，我的父亲塞布斯瓦尔（Sibeswar）与母亲谦达娜（Chandana）的经历也是这个故事的重要组成部分，而我的姐姐拉努（Ranu）与姐夫桑杰（Sanjay）为本书提供了道德指引。与此同时，我与朱迪（Judy）、施家铭（Chia-Ming Sze）、戴维·斯茨（David Sze）以及凯瑟琳·多诺霍（Kathleen Donohue）还就家庭与未来的话题展开过多次讨论。

接下来，我要感谢为本书提供慷慨建议的各位专家学者，正是在他们的帮助下《基因传》才能够确保内容准确无误，其中就包括保罗·伯格（遗传学与克隆）、戴维·博特斯坦（基因定位）、埃里克·兰德与罗伯特·沃特（人类基因组计划）、罗伯特·霍维茨与戴维·赫什（蠕虫生物学）、汤姆·马尼亚蒂斯（分子生物学）、肖恩·卡罗尔（进化与基因调控）、哈罗德·瓦默斯（癌症）、南希·西格尔（双胞胎研究）、因德尔·维尔马（基因治疗）、珍妮弗·杜德娜（基因编辑）、南希·韦克斯勒（人类基因图谱）、马库斯·费德曼（人类进化）、杰拉尔德·菲施巴赫（精神分裂症与自闭症）、戴维·艾利斯与蒂莫西·贝斯特（表观遗传学）、弗朗西斯·柯林斯（基因定位与人类基因组计划）、埃里克·托普尔（人类遗传学）与休·杰克曼（“金刚狼”，变种人）。

除此之外，阿肖克·拉伊（Ashok Rai）、内尔·布雷耶（Nell Breyer）、比尔·赫尔曼（Bill Helman）、高拉夫·马宗达（Gaurav Majumdar）、苏曼·施洛德卡（Suman Shirodkar）、梅鲁·戈哈尔（Meru Gokhale）、切克·萨卡尔（Chiki Sarkar）、戴维·布里施泰因（David Blistein）、阿兹拉·拉扎（Azra Raza）、切特纳·乔普拉（Chetna Chopra）与苏祖·巴塔恰里雅（Sujoy Bhattacharyya）在《基因传》初稿完成之后为本书提供了极其宝贵的意见。同时我在与丽莎·尤斯塔维奇（Lisa Yuskavage）、玛特威·莱文斯坦（Matvey Levenstein）、雷切尔·费因斯坦（Rachel Feinstein）以及约翰·柯林（John Currin）的交流中也获益匪浅。而尤斯塔维奇在她的作品（《双胞胎》）中引用了《基因传》与《医学的真相》的内容。布列塔尼·拉什（Brittany Rush）不仅耐心（出色）地完成了800余条参考文献的整理工作，并且还专心致志地投入到枯燥乏味的出版工作中；丹尼尔·勒德尔（Daniel Loedel）只用了一个周末的时间就确认文稿达到了预期目标。此外，米娅·克劳利—霍尔德（Mia Crowley-Hald）与安娜—索菲亚·瓦茨（Anna-Sophia Watts）在文字编辑过程中发挥了至关重要的作用，而凯特·洛伊德（Kate Lloyd）绝对是公关领域的天才。

本书的封面插图出自我的好友加布里埃尔·奥罗斯科（Gabriel Orozco），他独具匠心地通过大小不等的相切圆展现出整部作品的精华。我无法想象还有什么创意能够比这幅画面更适合《基因传》。

最后，我要由衷地感谢主编南·格雷厄姆（Nan Graham）：你与斯图亚特·威廉姆斯（Stuart Williams）和萨拉·查尔方特（Sarah Chalfant）一起读完了那份68页的草稿，而萨拉当时只是通过两段文字介绍就敏锐地发现了这部作品的价值，你们不仅让《基因传》担当起时代的重任，还为它插上了腾飞的翅膀。





词汇表


等位基因（allele）：基因的变异体或替代形式。等位基因通常由突变产生并且会造成表型变异。一个基因可以拥有多个等位基因。

级联反应（cascade）：指在一系列连续事件中前面一种事件能激发后面一种事件的反应，其化学修饰为酶促反应以及放大效应。

中心法则或中心理论（central dogma, or central theory）：在大多数生物体中，遗传信息只能从DNA（基因）传递给信使RNA，然后再从RNA传递给蛋白质。该理论在发展过程中已经过多次修改。其中逆转录病毒中的逆转录酶能以RNA为模板形成DNA。

染色质（chromatin）：染色体的组成成分。由于最初是在进行细胞染色时发现的这种物质，因此人们就用chroma（颜色）对其命名。染色质中可能包含有DNA、RNA与蛋白质。

染色体（chromosome）：这种由DNA与蛋白质组成的结构是细胞内储存遗传信息的载体。

DNA：脱氧核糖核酸，是所有细胞生物中携带遗传信息的化学物质。它在细胞中通常以两条配对互补链的形式出现。其中每条化学链都是由A、C、T与G四种碱基组成。基因携带的信息通过遗传“密码”的形式得到体现，而该序列在翻译成为蛋白质前先要经过RNA转录。

酶（enzyme）：某种加速生物化学反应的蛋白质。

表观遗传学（epigenetics）：在基因序列不变（例如A、C、T与G）的情况下，研究表型发生变异的遗传学分支学科。DNA化学修饰（例如甲基化）或DNA组装发生改变（例如组蛋白）是导致这种现象的常见原因。其中某些修饰具有可遗传性。

基因（gene）：作为遗传物质的基本单位，基因通常由编码蛋白质或RNA链的DNA片段组成（在某些特殊情况下，基因可能以RNA的形式存在）。

基因组（genome）：生物体携带的全套遗传信息。基因组包括蛋白质编码基因、非蛋白质编码基因、基因调节区域以及功能未知的DNA序列。

基因型（genotype）：决定生物体物理、化学、生物与智力特征（见“表型”）的全部遗传信息。

突变（mutation）：DNA的化学结构发生改变。突变既可以表现为沉默（也就是说这种变化不会对生物体的功能产生影响）也可以导致生物体的功能或结构出现变化。

细胞核（nucleus）：这种膜包裹的细胞结构或细胞器存在于动物或植物细胞（不包括细菌细胞）中。动物细胞的染色体（与基因）就位于细胞核内。在动物细胞中，尽管大多数基因存在于细胞核内，但是线粒体亦可以携带少量基因。

细胞器（organelle）：细胞中具有特殊功能的细胞亚单位。不同的细胞器通常被包裹在各自的膜结构中。例如线粒体是一种可以产生能量的细胞器。

外显率（penetrance）：携带特定基因变异的生物体表现出相关性状或表型的百分比。在医学遗传学中，外显率是指导致个体出现某种疾病症状的基因型百分比。

表型（phenotype）：个体在生物、物理与智力特征等方面的表现，例如皮肤颜色或眼睛颜色。此外，表型还包括某些复杂的特征，例如气质或性格。表型由基因、表观遗传改变、环境因素与随机概率共同决定。

蛋白质（protein）：这种化学物质的核心结构由基因翻译的氨基酸链组成。蛋白质可以执行大部分细胞功能，其中就包括传递信号、提供结构支撑与加速生化反应。基因通常会为蛋白质“合成”提供蓝图。而加入磷酸、糖或脂质等小分子化合物可以对蛋白质进行化学修饰。

逆转录（reverse transcription）：在逆转录酶的作用下，以RNA链作为模板合成DNA链的过程。逆转录酶存在于逆转录病毒中。

核糖体（ribosome）：这种由蛋白质与RNA组成的细胞结构负责解码合成蛋白质所需的信使RNA。

RNA：核糖核酸，是一种执行多种细胞功能的化学物质，它可以作为“中介”信息将基因翻译成蛋白质。RNA由碱基（A、C、G与U）链与磷酸糖骨架结合而成。细胞中的RNA通常以单链形式存在（DNA通常为双链），但是在特殊情况下也会形成双链RNA。而以逆转录病毒为代表的生物体可以将RNA作为遗传信息的载体。

性状、显性性状与隐性性状（traits, dominant and recessive）：性状是指生物体的物理或生物学特征。多个基因可以编码相同的性状，而单个基因亦可以编码不同的性状。显性性状是指显性与隐性等位基因同时存在时表现出的性状，而隐性性状指两个等位基因均为隐性时表现出的性状。此外，基因可以表现为共显性：在这种情况下，同时存在显性与隐性等位基因的生物体将表现为中间性状。

转录（transcription）：以基因为模板生成RNA拷贝的过程。经过转录后，DNA中的遗传密码（ATG—CAC—GGG）就可产生RNA“拷贝”（AUG—CAC—GGG）。

转化（transformation）：遗传物质在生物体之间的水平转移。一般来说，细菌无须繁殖即可通过传递遗传物质在生物体间交换遗传信息。

翻译（基因）【translation(of genes)】：核糖体将遗传信息由RNA信息转换为蛋白质的过程。在翻译过程中，由于RNA上的三联体密码（例如AUG）对应着某个氨基酸（例如蛋氨酸），因此一条RNA链就可以编码一条氨基酸链。





译者注记


我与穆克吉医生的作品结缘还要追溯至《众病之王：癌症传》。当时徐文老师介绍我与董正和刘利娴夫妇相识，席间董正提到中信出版集团刚刚上市了一本新书《众病之王：癌症传》，而我的主要研究方向恰好就聚焦在肿瘤领域。《众病之王：癌症传》的确是一部引人入胜的医学经典，从此我就对于穆克吉医生的作品有了某种期待。2016年5月，我得知穆克吉医生撰写的另一部力作《基因传》即将在美国问世，同时这本书的中译本也列入了中信出版集团的日程。其实我在正式接手《基因传》的翻译工作之前还是有些犹豫，毕竟本书许多内容涉及遗传学、生物学以及社会学等专业领域，因此如何再现本书的精髓是项非常艰巨的挑战。虽然我从未与穆克吉医生进行过沟通，但是同为医者的经历却令人感到默契。当本书译稿画上句号时，我深深感到发自内心的解脱。《基因传》不仅是一部翔实记述科学发展的历史，更是人类在21世纪面向未来的宣言。

我在此要感谢郭佳希博士、张雪博士、袁春旭、李雪、许林军在《基因传》初译稿整理过程中付出的辛勤努力。与此同时，徐文老师作为《基因传》的第一位读者对于译稿提出了许多真知灼见，而远在美国的姐姐马篱梅博士与姐夫俞从容博士为本书提供了专业指导。除此之外，徐珮雯、张薇以及范重君也帮助我一起在文字上精雕细琢。

《基因传》的顺利出版彰显了团队合作的重要性。我在此要感谢夏嘉老师自始至终的鼎力支持，而丁川老师引进的系列国外优秀作品堪称经典，同时王强老师带领的小伙伴们一直在争分夺秒，尤其是肖雪在审校过程中任劳任怨，当然还有最早合作的覃田甜老师以及那些默默无闻的编辑，是你们给了我足够的信任与时间去实现这个梦想。

最后，我要由衷感谢父亲与母亲将他们勤劳朴素的基因融入我的血脉，而宝妈与宝宝就是绘制靓丽蓝图的DNA！

12 “The [variant] will be swamped”: Fleeming Jenkin, “The Origin of Species,” North British Review 47 (1867): 158.

13 There was no denying: In fairness to Darwin, he had sensed the problem in “blend-ing inheritance” even without Jenkin’s interjection. “If varieties be allowed freely to cross, such varieties will be constantly demolished...... any small tendency in them to vary will be constantly counteracted,” he wrote in his notes.

5 “remained constant without exception”: Eric C. R. Reeve, Encyclopedia of Genetics (London: Fitzroy Dearborn, 2001), 62.

6 Contrary to later belief: Mendel had several predecessors who had studied plant hy-brids just as intensively, except, perhaps, without Mendel’s immersion in numbers and quantification. In the 1820s, English botanists, such as T. A. Knight, John Goss, Alexander Seton, and William Herbert — attempting to breed more vigorous agri-cultural plants — had performed experiments with plant hybrids that were strikingly similar to Mendel’s. In France, Augustine Sageret’s work on melon hybrids was also similar to Mendel’s work. The most intensive work on plant hybrids immediately preceding Mendel was performed by the German botanist Josef K.lreuter, who had bred Nicotania hybrids. K.lreuter’s work was followed by the work of Karl von Gaertner and Charles Naudin in Paris. Darwin had actually read Sageret’s and Naudin’s stud-ies, both of which suggested the particulate quality of hereditary information, but Darwin had failed to appreciate their importance.

18 Although it was eventually found to be unconstitutional, this law is widely regarded as the first eugenics sterilization legislation passed in the world. In 1927, a revised law was implemented and before it was repealed in 1974, over 2,300 of the state’s most vulnerable citizens were involuntarily sterilized. In addition, In-diana established a state-funded Committee on Mental Defectives that carried out eugenic family studies in over twenty counties and was home to an active “better ba-bies” movement that encouraged scientific motherhood and infant hygiene as routes to human improvement. http://www.iupui.edu/~eugenics/.

7 Wilkins found an X-ray diffraction machine: Maurice Wilkins, correspondence with Raymond Gosling on the early days of DNA research at King’s College, 1976, Mau-rice Wilkins Papers, King’s College London Archives.

8 It was, as one friend of Franklin’s: Letter of June 12, 1985, notes on Rosalind Frank-lin, Maurice Wilkins Papers, no. ad92d68f-4071-4415-8df2-dcfe041171fd.

13 It was not just sexism: Crick never believed that Franklin was affected by sexism. Unlike Watson, who eventually wrote a generous recapitulation of Franklin’s work highlighting the adversities that she had faced as a scientist, Crick maintained that Franklin was unaffected by the atmosphere at King’s. Franklin and Crick would eventually become close friends in the late 1950s; Crick and his wife were especially helpful to Franklin during her prolonged illness and in the months preceding her untimely death. Crick’s fondness for Franklin can be found in Crick, What Mad Pur-suit, 82–85.

31 Recognizing that this measurement varied with age: The concept of IQ was initially developed by William Stern, the German psychologist.

32 Developmental psychologists such as Louis Thurstone: Louis Leon Thurstone, “The absolute zero in intelligence measurement,” Psychological Review 35, no. 3 (1928): 175; and L. Thurstone, “Some primary abilities in visual thinking,” Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society (1950): 517–21.

34 In the 1950s, a series of reports: George A. Jervis, “The mental deficiencies,” Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science (1953): 25–33. Also see Otis Dudley Duncan, “Is the intelligence of the general population declining?” American Sociological Review 17, no. 4 (1952): 401–7.

35 They limited the tests to only those administered after 1960: The particular variables as-sessed by Murray and Herrnstein deserve mention. They wondered whether a deep dis-enchantment with tests and scores might pervade African-Americans, making them reluctant to engage with IQ tests. But subtle experiments to measure and excise any such “test disengagement” could not erase the 15-point difference. They considered the possi-bility that the tests were culturally biased (perhaps the most notorious example, borrowed from an SAT examination, asks students to consider the analogy “oarsmen:regatta.” It hardly takes an expert on language and culture to know that most inner-city children, black or white, might have little knowledge of what a regatta is, let alone what an oars-man does in one). Yet even after removing such culture-specific and class-specific items from the tests, Murray and Herrnstein wrote, a difference of 15-odd points remained.

36 In the 1990s, the psychologist Eric Turkheimer: Eric Turkheimer, “Consensus and controversy about IQ,” Contemporary Psychology 35, no. 5 (1990): 428–30.

1694年，尼古拉斯·哈特苏克根据主观臆测勾勒出一幅蜷曲在精子中的缩微人画像。哈特苏克与同时代的许多生物学家一样崇尚“精源论”，而该理论认为形成胎儿的信息源自精子中的缩微人。



在欧洲中世纪时期，人们通常会根据“谱系树”来标记贵族家庭中的祖先与后代。这些谱系树被用来证明爵位与财产的归属或者是家族之间联姻的参考（部分减少了表兄妹之间近亲婚配的机会）。位于图片左上角的“基因”一词在这里是谱系或者血统的意思，直到几个世纪之后的1909年，基因这种遗传信息单位才被赋予现代意义。



查理·达尔文（70岁像）与他绘制的“生命之树”草图，该图显示所有生物体均源自某个相同的祖先（他在图片上方用怀疑的语气潦草地写着“我认为”）。达尔文进化论中的变异与自然选择需要基因理论的支持。仔细阅读达尔文进化论的读者可能会意识到，该理论仅在遗传微粒（不可分割且可以突变）能够在亲本与子代之间进行传递时才有意义。但由于达尔文从来没有拜读过格雷戈尔·孟德尔的文章，因此他也未能在有生之年对于进化论做出进一步的完善。





格雷戈尔·孟德尔手中的花朵可能摘自布尔诺（现位于捷克共和国）修道院花园中的某株豌豆。19世纪50年代到60年代，孟德尔通过实验开创性地证实了某些不可分割的信息微粒就是遗传信息的载体。孟德尔的论文（发表于1865年）被人们忽视了将近40年，而直到他的工作被重新发现后，生物学才跨入了新纪元。



弗朗西斯·高尔顿是英国数学家、生物学家与统计学家，他将个体数据制成“人体测量学卡片”，并且使用表格来反映身高、体重、容貌以及其他特征。高尔顿反对孟德尔的基因理论。他希望通过选择“最佳”的遗传性状与定向繁育后代来改良人种。高尔顿将这种借助遗传操作使人类获得解放的方法称为优生学，而这门学科随即沦为实现社会统治与政治野心的可怕工具。



1900年，威廉·贝特森“重新发现”了孟德尔的工作，而他本人也成为基因理论的忠实拥护者。1905年，贝特森首次使用“遗传学”这个词来描述遗传学研究。1909年，威廉·约翰森（左）在描述遗传单位的时候创造了“基因”一词。图为约翰森来到英国剑桥拜访贝特森时的合影，他们既是亲密的合作伙伴，也是基因理论的坚强捍卫者。





为了推行“种族卫生”计划，德国纳粹政府动用国家机器通过绝育、监禁与屠杀的方式进行种族清洗。他们通过双胞胎实验来证明遗传对于人类的影响，并且从肉体上清除那些携带有缺陷基因的男女老幼。更令人发指的是，纳粹分子还妄图使用“优生”手段来消灭犹太人、吉卜赛人、不同政见者以及同性恋者。上两图为纳粹科学家正在为双胞胎测量身高以及向新兵演示谱系图。



20世纪30年代，“健康婴儿大赛”被引入美国。医护人员正在对具有最佳遗传特征的儿童（均为白人）进行检查。这种比赛将最健康的婴儿作为基因选择的产物来展示，实际上被动支持了美国的优生学运动。



美国的《优生树》漫画主张“自我定向的人类进化”。其中医学、外科学、人类学与谱系学就相当于“树根”。优生学希望通过这些基本理论来选择更适合、更健康以及更聪明的人类。



20世纪30年代，卡丽·巴克与母亲艾玛·巴克被送至弗吉尼亚州立癫痫与智障收容所，而这里所有被认定为“弱智”的女性均需要接受绝育。这张照片摄于她们母女不经意的瞬间，其目的就是为了说明卡丽与艾玛彼此十分相似，并且以此作为她们具有“遗传性弱智”的证据。



20世纪20年代至30年代，托马斯·摩尔根在哥伦比亚大学与加州理工学院从事果蝇遗传领域的研究。他不仅证实了某些基因之间存在物理连接，而且还颇有先见之明地预测出这种单一的链状分子携带有遗传信息。最终，连锁定律被用于绘制人类基因图谱，并且为人类基因组计划奠定了基础。这张照片摄于摩尔根在加州理工学院的蝇室，他周围堆满了用于饲养蛆与果蝇的奶瓶。



20世纪50年代，罗莎琳德·富兰克林在伦敦国王学院使用显微镜观察研究结果。富兰克林在分析DNA结构的时候采用了X射线衍射成像技术，而她拍摄的51号照片是所有DNA晶体结构影像中最为完美的一张。尽管无法从照片中分辨出碱基A、C、T与G的方向，但是DNA的双螺旋结构已经一目了然。



1953年，沃森与克里克根据双股DNA链之间的碱基配对关系（A与T配对，G与C配对）证明了DNA为双螺旋结构。



20世纪50年代，维克多·马克库斯克在巴尔的摩创建了摩尔诊所，他在此对大量人类疾病相关基因进行了登记分类。马克库斯克发现数个不相干的基因突变决定了矮小症或侏儒症的表型。与之相反，单基因突变也可以导致患者出现各种不同的表型。



亨廷顿病（亨廷顿舞蹈症）是一种致死性的神经系统退行性疾病，患者身体会出现不自主的“舞蹈”动作或突然抽搐。由于南希·韦克斯勒的母亲与舅舅就患有此病，因此她义无反顾地投入到了寻找亨廷顿病基因的工作中。经过不懈努力，韦克斯勒在委内瑞拉发现了许多亨廷顿病患者，而他们体内的致病基因似乎均来源于同一位祖先。亨廷顿病是第一种通过现代基因定位技术确诊的单基因遗传病。



20世纪70年代，学生们在遗传会议现场举行抗议活动。由于无法忘却历史上德国纳粹政府推行优生学的暴行，因此人们非常担心基因测序、基因克隆与重组DNA等新技术会沦为创建“完美种族”的工具。图中标语出自希特勒：“我们将创造完美的种族。”



1975年，保罗·伯格、玛克辛·辛格与诺顿·津德在阿西洛马会议期间进行交流，与此同时悉尼·布伦纳在后面做记录。伯格等学者发现某类技术可以让杂交DNA分子（重组DNA）在细菌中大量扩增（基因克隆），于是他们建议在这种技术的风险得到充分评估前“暂停”某些重组DNA工作。



1976年，赫伯特·博耶（左）与罗伯特·斯旺森创建了通过基因工程生产药物的基因泰克公司。他们背后黑板上展现的是应用重组DNA技术生产胰岛素的方案，而斯旺森见证了首次大规模从细菌培养箱中生产出此类蛋白质的过程。



弗雷德里克·桑格正在检查DNA测序凝胶。桑格发明的DNA测序技术（也就是按照基因上碱基A、C、T与G的顺序读取）不仅彻底改变了我们对于基因的认识，而且还为人类基因组计划奠定了基础。



1999年，杰西·基辛格在去世前几个月于费城的光谱球馆前拍照留念。基辛格是世界上首批接受基因治疗的患者之一。研究人员通过病毒将矫正的突变基因注入其肝脏，但是基辛格随即就对病毒发生了超敏免疫反应，而他最终不幸因多器官功能衰竭死亡。基辛格“死于生物技术”的事实在全美引起了强烈反响，人们对于基因治疗临床试验的安全性表现出严重关切。



2000年6月26日，克雷格·文特尔（左）、克林顿总统（中）以及弗朗西斯·柯林斯在白宫宣布完成了人类基因组序列草图。（图片来源：AP / 东方IC）



2001年2月，《科学》杂志在封面上宣传了人类基因组序列草图。



尽管胎儿性别鉴定并不能改变人类基因组，但是这种方法还是在全球造成了极大的负面影响。历史上在亚洲部分地区，人们在通过羊膜穿刺对胎儿进行性别鉴定后会选择性地将女性胎儿流产，从而导致男女性别比例出现严重失衡，并且使人口与家庭结构发生前所未有的改变。



由于超级计算机可以快速精准地对遗传信息进行分析与注释，因此新型基因测序仪（位于那些灰箱样的柜子中）可以在几个月之内就完成人类基因组的测序。此类技术可以对多细胞胚胎或胎儿进行基因组测序，从而使胚胎植入前遗传学诊断与宫内诊断疾病成为现实。



珍妮弗·杜德娜（右）是加州大学伯克利分校研究RNA的生物学家，她与其他科学家一起正在研究某种可以实现基因定向突变的系统。尽管其安全性与保真性尚待进一步完善，但是该系统从理论上来讲能够用于“编辑”人类基因组。如果定向基因改变可以被导入精子、卵细胞或人类胚胎干细胞，那么这项技术就可以让人类的基因发生改变。
